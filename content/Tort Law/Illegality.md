# Illegality

Also known as *ex turpi causa non oritur actio*, meaning 'no action may be based on an illegal cause'. If the defence of illegality is established, it is a **complete defence**.

## Rationale

Desire to avoid granting a claim where this would produce inconsistency and disharmony in the law.

e.g., in [[Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority [1998] QB 978]] the health authority successfully argued illegality.

In [[Re Mahmoud and Ispahani [1921] 2 KB 716]] the defendant successfully argued illegality to dismiss a claim for breach of contract.

## Limits of the Defence

Defence is problematic. Imagine a car crash where the injured party was slightly speeding. Should they be prevented from claiming when other car is mostly at fault?

Two-step process for considering whether defence of illegality should apply:

1. Consider whether the claimant was committing an illegal (or possibly grossly immoral) act at the time they suffered their loss caused by the defendant (e.g., [[Ashton v Turner [1981] QB 137]]). If yes, continue
2. Apply test from [[Patel v Mirza [2016] UKSC 42]], taking into account earlier decisions with similar facts.

### Patel V Mirza Test

In this case, the Supreme Court confirmed that the underlying policy question which needed to be answered when determining whether illegality applied is,

>“whether allowing recovery for something which was illegal would produce inconsistency and disharmony in the law, so cause damage to the integrity of the legal system”.

In order to determine this question, the court identified the following “trio of necessary conditions”:

1. The underlying purpose of the prohibition which has been transgressed and whether that purpose will be enhanced by denial of the claim
2. Other relevant public policy which may be rendered ineffective/ less effective by denial of the claim
3. Whether denying the claim would be a proportional response to the illegality.

For proportionality assessment, considerations include:

- Seriousness of conduct
- Its centrality to the tort
- Whether it was intentional and whether there was a marked disparity in the parties' respective culpability

Or think of this as whether there is a causal link between illegality and tort.

Note that principles identified in [[Patel v Mirza [2016] UKSC 42]] derived from previous case law, so cases pre-dating Patel continue to have precedential value unless incompatible.

Prior to *Patel v Mirza* it was generally thought that the defence only arises if the facts which give rise to the claim are inextricably linked with the criminal activity. The court made clear that that was no longer the test, but this is still likely to be a relevant consideration when considering proportionality.

Following cases can be useful:

- [[Pitts v Hunt [1991] 1 QB 24]]: illegality caused the tort to happen
- [[Delaney v Pickett [2011] EWCA Civ 1532]]: illegality was just context
- [[Bank St Petersburg PJSC v Arkhangelsky [2018] EWHC 1077 (Ch)]]
