# volenti non fit injuri

_**Volenti non fit injuria**_ is a defence of limited application in tort law. A direct translation of the latin phrase _**volenti non fit injuria**_ is, 'to one who volunteers, no harm is done'. Where the defence of _**volenti**_ applies it operates as a complete defence absolving the Defendant of all liability. It is often stated that the Claimant consents to the the risk of harm, however, the **defence of _volenti_** is much more limited in its application and should not be confused with the defence of consent in relation to trespass.   The defence of **v_olenti non fit injuria_** requires a **freely entered and voluntary agreement by the Claimant, in full knowledge of the circumstances, to absolve the Defendant of all legal consequences of their actions.** There is a considerable overlap with [[Contributory negligence]] and since the introduction of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, the courts have been less willing to make a finding of _**volenti**_ preferring to apportion loss between the parties rather than taking an all or nothing approach.
