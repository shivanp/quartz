# Consent

Defences to not become relevant until tort has been established. For the defendant to prove a defence on the balance of probabilities.

Consent also called *volenti non fit injuria* - "that to which a man consents cannot be considered an injury".

## Test

To succeed, defendant must show that claimant:

- Has capacity to give valid consent to risks
	- Usually easy to prove unless child
	- [[Reeves v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [1999] 3 All ER 897]]: defence of consent could not be used where duty of care owed: prisoner did not have capacity (even though damages reduced because [[Contributory negligence]])
- Has **full** knowledge of nature and extent of the risk(s) that materialised. General knowledge will not suffice
- This is subjective: the question is whether the particular claimant knew the risk ([[Morris v Murray [1991] 2 QB 6]] held that claimant had full knowledge of risks
- Agreed to risk of injury
	- Knowledge of the risk alone is not the same as consenting to it ([[Dann v Hamilton [1939] 1 KB 509]]: not drunk enough for consent to be established)
	- This agreement can be impliedly indicated, where the activity is "engaging in an intrinsically and obviously dangerous occupation, [like] intermeddling with an unexploded bomb or walking on the edge of an unfenced cliff'"
	- In sport, the courts have held that by willingly engaging in the sport, the claimant voluntarily agrees to the risks inherent to that sport but not to risks which are not inherent, e.g., serious foul play in football.
- Agreed voluntarily
	- [[Smith v Baker & Sons [1891] AC 325]]
	- [[Baker v T.E. Hopkins & Son Ltd [1959] 3 All ER 225]]
	- It would be wrong to say that 'â€¦an employee will have consented to risks that it was fully informed of when choosing to start / continue working' because Smith v Charles Baker & Sons makes clear that the requirement of voluntary consent is in addition to knowledge of the risk. Employees who know of the risks of their jobs are not necessarily voluntarily running those risks, since they may have little real option if they wish to keep their job.

## Consent Negated by Statute

- [s 149 Road Traffic Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/149) prevents use of consent by motorists facing claims from their passengers.
- s 2 of [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]]: applies to defendants acting in course of business (but not where claimant is a consumer). s 2(1) prohibits defendants excluding or restricting liability for death or personal injuries resulting from negligence. s 2(2) other types of loss may be excluded, subject to reasonableness test. s 2(3) person's agreement to or awareness of contract not itself indicating voluntary acceptance of any risk.
- s 65(1) of [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] prohibits traders, when dealing with consumers, from using contract terms/notices limiting or excluding liability for death or personal injury through negligence. s 62: an exclusion clause is only binding if it is fair. s 65(2) states voluntary acceptance of risk cannot be assumed merely because consumer agreed/ knew about risk.
