# Negligence and defective products

When considering a problem involving a defective product, a practitioner should consider:

- Negligence
- Breach of contract
- The Consumer Protection Act 1987

## Liability in Negligence

Starting point: is there a precedent for whether a duty is owed?

[[Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562]] is a precedent for the proposition that a manufacturer owes a duty of care to those people who use its products. The manufacturer owes a duty not only to the final purchaser at the end of the supply chain, but also to other users of the product.

[[Stennett v Hancock [1939] 2 All ER 578]] established that a manufacturer owes a duty to a party that neither bought nor used the product, but who comes into contact with it.

With product liability, the most likely 'target' is the manufacturer, but liability extends to other parties involved with the product too, including repairers ([[Haseldine v CA Daw [1941] 2 KB 343]]), and suppliers and distributors, where they should have inspected the product and would then have discovered the defect ([[Malfroot v Noxal Ltd (1935) 51 TLR 551]]).

There is no absolute duty to inspect and test every product; reasonableness depends on the circumstances.

The key question is whether the manufacturer fell below the standard of a reasonably competent manufacturer.

### Pure Economic Loss

Where the loss being considered is the loss of the product itself (i.e., cost of replacement sought) then this is pure economic loss, which is in general not recoverable.

## Breach

The standard of care expected of the manufacturer (that of a reasonably competent manufacturer), and whether the manufacturer has fallen below that standard, must be analysed. Consider the likelihood of harm, magnitude of harm and practicality of precautions, based on the knowledge/ accepted practice at the time.

Though breach must be proved, in many case the presence of a defect will be sufficient evidence to establish breach, unless the manufacturer can show another reason for the defect. But the breach is still for the claimant to prove, and in some cases this can be a significant hurdle, particularly if the defect stems from a problem in the design of a product, rather than the manufacturing process.

## Causation

A manufacturer might argue that where goods were going to be examined at some point between manufacture and use, any harm caused to the consumer is not the responsibility of the manufacturer. Intermediate inspection point was clarified in [[Haseldine v Daw [1941] 2 KB 343]], where Lord Goddard referred to a ‘reasonable probability’ rather than a ‘reasonable possibility’ of intermediate examination. Courts now work on this basis. So a manufacturer will be held liable if they have no reason to contemplate that an intermediate inspection will occur.

If there is a warning to test the product, or use it in a particular way, and the claimant fails to carry this out, this may be sufficient to break the chain of causation ([[Holmes v Ashford [1950] 2 All ER 76]]).
