# Standard of care

## Standard of Care

Usual starting point: defendant must behave as a reasonable person would in all the circumstances (set out in [[Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co (1856) 11 Exch 781]] or [Glasgow Corporation v Muir 1943 SC(HL) 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muir_v_Glasgow_Corp)). Under this perspective, negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable person would do.

Test is objective, but specific to the circumstances of the case, i.e. what a reasonable person would do in those specific circumstances. Based on the act, not the actor.

To defendant is not expected to be ‘a paragon of circumspection’ (Lord Reid, [[AC Billings & Sons Ltd v Riden [1958] AC 240]]), i.e., as cautious as possible

### Cases

- In [[Nettleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691]] a learner driver was judged by the standard of an ordinary competent driver
- In [[Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority [1988] AC 1074]] a lower standard was not applied for a junior doctor
- In [[Condon v Basi [1985] 1 WLR 866]] it was suggested that a higher degree of care would be required for a first division footballer than a local league player

## Professional Standard

A different standard is expected of professionals, as outlined in the key case [[Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 583]], which held that the test is the standard of the ordinary reasonable man exercising and professing to have that special skill.

Note that a responsible body of opinion does not have to be the majority view. In [[De Freitas v O'Brien and Connolly [1995] 6 Med LR 108]], a body of eleven spinal surgeons out of 1000 orthopaedic and neurosurgeons were a responsible body (given their qualifications and experience). See also [[Maynard v West Midlands RHA [1985] 1 All ER 635]].

BUT not always enough to show that a practice is commonplace: must also be reasonable or responsible. The opinion must be able to withstand logical analysis: see [[Bolitho v City & Hackney Health Authority [1997] 3 WLR 1151]].

In _Bolitho_, Lord Browne-Wilkinson said:

> ‘The court has to be satisfied that…the body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such opinion has a logical basis. In particular, in cases involving, as they so often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge before accepting a body of opinion as being responsible, reasonable or respectable, will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible conclusion on the matter.’

Reaction to people thinking that courts were too deferential to doctors; now could enquire as to whether decisions of opinion were logical. _Bolitho_ was applied in [[McGuinn v Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust [2017] EWHC 88 (QB)]]

### Failure to Advise of Risks

The Bolam Test does **not** apply when considering whether a medical professional is in breach of duty for a failure to warn of risks of procedures ([[Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11]]).

Medical professionals are under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of **any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments**.

Note that Montgomery has not been confined to consent cases. Its principles have been applied to the duty to inform a patient of the need for follow-up treatment ([[Gallardo v Imperial College Healthcare Trust [2017] EWHC 3147 (QB) ]]) and outside a medical context in [[O'Hare v Coutts & Co [2016] EWHC 2224 (QB) ]], where the defendant bank was found to owe a duty to take reasonable care to warn its customers of risks relating to suggested investments.

Exception: medical professional can withhold information if they reasonably consider that its disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the patient's health - [[Pearce and Pearce v United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust [1998] EWCA Civ 865]], therapeutic privilege. This therapeutic privilege argument survives the decision in Montgomery. The phrase, ‘seriously detrimental to the patient’s health’ is notoriously vague but Lord Woolf CJ in Pearce held that it would include the triggering of either mental or physical harm in a patient. The argument will only apply in ‘wholly exceptional cases’, per Lord Steyn in [[Chester v Afshar [2004] UKHL 41]]. It cannot be used as an excuse to hide risks merely because the doctor thinks that the patient might reach a decision that s/he personally thinks is not in their best interests.

Also in circumstances of necessity (patient unconscious).

## Lower Standard

A lower standard should not be applied to adults, even if they may be inexperienced. Junior professional not necessarily in breach if they sought advice from a more senior/ experienced colleague.

However, it is not always appropriate to apply a professional standard to the actions of an amateur. In [[Wells v Cooper [1958] 2 QB 265]] the defendant fixed their door knob incorrectly, injuring a guest.

### Children

In the case of children, standard required will be that of the reasonable child of the defendant's age ([[Mullin v Richards [1998] 1 WLR 1304]]), upheld in [[Orchard v Lee [2009] EWCA Civ 295]]

### Illness and Disability

In [[Roberts v Ramsbottom [1980] 1 WLR 823]] the defendant was judged by the standard of a reasonably competent driver: he should have stopped the car as soon as he realised his driving was affected.

In [[Mansfield v Weetabix [1997] EWCA Civ 1352]], the defendant was judged against a reasonably competent driver who is unaware he is suffering a condition impairing his ability to drive.

[[Dunnage v Randall [2015] EWCA Civ 673]] -- mental health not an exception unless it entirely eliminates responsibility
