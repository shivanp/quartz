# Remedies

In tort, the two principal remedies a court can award.

## Injunction

An order forcing the defendant to act, or preventing the defendant from acting in a certain way. Rare and only suitable for certain cases.

## Damages

Award of money. The aim of damages in the law of tort is to put the claimant in the position they would have been in **but for** the defendant's tortious act, as far as possible. Backwards looking.

Vast majority of awards of damages in tort are 'compensatory damages': damages awarded to compensate the claimant for the harm they have suffered.

Subdivide into two categories:

Damages | Description
---|---
Special damages | Cover specifically provable and quantifiable financial losses at the time of trial (e.g. loss of earnings incurred before trial).
General damages | Cover future financial losses, which cannot be specifically proven, and non-quantifiable losses like compensation for physical injury.

### Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenity Award (PSLA)

'Loss of amenity' attempts to compensate for the effect of injury on claimant's lifestyle, e.g., if they can no longer swim or walk. Depends on how active the claimant was before injury.

PSLA award will always be expressed as a single overall lump sum.

Case law used as reference when determining level of compensation a claimant may receive. Published in Kemp and Kemp.

### Calculating Future Losses

Basic approach: take annual expense and multiply it by number of years loss will continue to be suffered. But leads to over-compensation: court usually works on assumption that lump sum will be invested.

### Deductions From Damages

Usually following deducted from damages:

- State benefits received by the claimant as a result of their injury (amount deduced paid back to State)
- Contractual sick pay received as result of injury
- Redundancy payment, if redundancy resulted from injury

Damages may be further reduced through finding of [[Contributory negligence]]. Insurance pay-outs, ill-health pensions and gifts/ charity sums **not** deducted.

### Damages When Claimant Dies

#### [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/24-25/41/contents)

The 'estate' of the deceased may bring a claim for any losses (both pecuniary (money-related) and non-pecuniary) suffered by the deceased as a result of the accident up to the date of death.

No claim can be made for losses arisen after death (s 1(2)(a)), or the death itself. Someone dying but not dead can't claim for their loss of life expectancy.

#### [Fatal Accidents Act 1976](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/30/contents)

Allows any dependants of the deceased to claim for any losses suffered as a result of the death (e.g. family members who relied on salary).

Here “dependants” defined as:

- Close blood relations
- Those related by marriage
- Those who have cohabited for over two years (s 1(3))

Losses arising from date of death to date of assessment will be specifically calculated, and any loss continuing will be awarded either as a lump sum or on a multiplier basis as appropriate.

Multipliers will be lower than in personal injury cases, just because of more uncertainties.

Additionally, the Act provides for:

- Spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner of the deceased, or parents of an unmarried minor (only mother if the child is illegitimate) to claim bereavement damages. This is a specified fixed sum. Cohabiting partner must have been living with the deceased at time of death, and for at least two years before that date;
- Recovery of funeral expenses.
