# Public bodies and duty of care

## Starting Point

In general, public bodies may owe a [[duty of care]] where the principles applicable to private individuals would impose such a duty. True in relation to both positive acts or omissions.

## Complicating Factors

1. Most public bodies derive their powers or duties from statutes
2. When developing the law of negligence, court must look into what is [[fair, just and reasonable]] and take into account policy considerations. Often tricks for public bodies.

## Key Case

In [[CN and GN v Poole Borough Council [2019] UKSC 25]], the court summarised the law as

1. When looking at positive acts and omissions, liability of a public authority is in principle the same as that of a private person, but may be restricted by statutory powers or duties.
2. For omissions, the usual law applying to individuals again applies.

Following this case, scope for raising any policy considerations unique to public bodies now seem limited. Little discussion of policy during the case. But policy points would be:

- Taxpayer often responsible in successful claims against public bodies
- Imposition of duty may restrict public services due to fear of litigation.

## Operational Vs Policy

Historically, the suggestion is that a public body can be held liable for operational matters, but not policy decisions. In [[Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 2 All ER 985]], police could be held liable for way in which CS gas was used, but not the decision to equip police with a flammable gas.

## Other Cases

- In [[Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough (2000) 3 WLR 776]], a duty of care was owed because the local authority had assumed responsibility for a child's educational services. Imposition of liability for omission where party had assumed responsibility is an example of principle that **liability can be imposed where there is exceptional proximity between the claimant and defendant**.
- In [[Jebson v Ministry of Defence [2000] 1 WLR 2055]], commander owed claimant a duty of care by implicitly assuming responsibility for his safety on the return trip; was in breach of this given lack of suitable transport/ supervision.
- No duty of care owed to soldiers during active combat ([[Mulcahy v Ministry of Defence [1996] QB 732 (CA)]]).
