# Product liability

## Consumer Protection Act 1987

The [Consumer Protection Act 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43/contents) provides a statutory basis for claiming in relation to damage caused by defective products. It does not replace any claim in negligence, or breach of contract. So making claims under all three should be considered in practice.

A successful claim in negligence requires the claimant to show fault on the part of the defendant. The Act introduces a strict liability regime: where parties can be found liable without it being necessary to show fault on their part. The act stems from an EU directive.

## Key Sections

Section | Description
---|---
[s 2(1) CPA 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43/section/2) | Subject to the following provisions of this Part, where any damage is caused wholly or partly by a defect in a product, every person to whom subsection (2) below applies shall be liable for the damage.
[s 1(2) CPA 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43/section/1) | “Product” means any goods or electricity and (subject to subsection (3) below) includes a product which is comprised in another product, whether by virtue of being a component part or raw material or otherwise.
[s 3(1) CPA 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43/section/3) | There is a defect in a product for the purposes of this Part if the safety of the product is not such as persons generally are entitled to expect; and for those purposes “safety”, in relation to a product, shall include safety with respect to products comprised in that product and safety in the context of risks of damage to property, as well as in the context of risks of death or personal injury.
[s 3(2) CPA 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43/section/3) | Expands on what people are reasonably entitled to expect depending on the circumstances. These include manner/ purpose of marketing, what might reasonably be expected to be done with the product, the time when the product was supplied by its producer.

See [[Richardson v LRC Products Ltd [2000] Lloyd’s Rep Med 280]]: what people generally expect as reasonable.

Absence of warning is significant ([[Abouzaid v Mothercare (UK) Ltd, The Times, 20 February 2001]]).

### S 3(1) Vs Standard of Care in Negligence

The Act was meant to demand considerably more of manufacturers than traditional negligence requires. This was demonstrated in [[A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289]]. [[Richardson v LRC Products Ltd [2000] Lloyd’s Rep Med 280]] was distinguished because condoms are generally known not to be 100% reliable, whereas the same cannot be said of blood.

See also [[Gee v DePuy International Ltd [2018] EWHC 1208 (QB)]], where [[A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289]] was again distinguished and a claim under CPA 1987 rejected.

## Damage

s 5(1):

> ‘Subject to the following provisions of this section, in the Part “damage” means death or personal injury or any loss or damages to any property (including land)’.

Most types of loss count as damage within the meaning of the Act, but **not** pure economic loss. No claim can be brought for the loss of the product itself, or any product supplied with the defective product as part of it.

Some further limits:

- No claim can be brought in relation to damage to property unless the sum to be awarded exceeds £275, excluding interest (s 5(4)).
- No claim for damage to property can be brought unless the property is ordinarily intended for private use / occupation / consumption and intended by the person suffering the loss or damage mainly for his own private use / occupation / consumption (s 5(3)).

This means that losses suffered by businesses are unlikely to be recoverable.

## Persons Liable for Damage Caused by a Defective Product

s 2(2):

> (2)This subsection applies to—  
> (a)the producer of the product;  
> (b)any person who, by putting his name on the product or using a trade mark or other distinguishing mark in relation to the product, has held himself out to be the producer of the product;  
> (c)any person who has imported the product into the United Kingdom in order, in the course of any business of his, to supply it to another.

s 1(2): 'producer' means

Type of product | Manufacturer
---|---
Products that are manufactured | The manufacturer
Products that are 'won or abstracted' (like coal) | The person who won/ abstracted it
For products to which neither of the above applies, but where the essential characteristic are attributable to a process carried out (like agriculture) | The person who carried out the process.

s 2(3) is also relevant, which provides that someone who supplied a defective product to any person will be liable for the damage caused by the defect, if the person suffering damage

- Asks for details of the producer/ importer within a reasonable time, and
- They cannot identify the producer/ importer themselves, and
- The supplier fails to identify that person.

e.g., a retailer who fails to tell someone suffering damage who produced/ imported the goods might open themselves up to a claim against themselves instead.

Result: more than one person can be liable for the same damage under the Act. If so, they will be jointly and severally liable (s 2(5)).

## Who Can Bring a Claim

Neither in s 2(1) nor anywhere else is there a description of who can bring a claim. Act refers to a consumer but nowhere is consumer defined. But recall business losses cannot be recovered.

Protection is not limited to people who purchased the product (as would usually be the case in a contractual claim), nor to the people who used the product. Anyone suffering damage as a result of the defect can sue.

Leads to interesting consequences. Suppose a product is intended solely for business use, marketed as such, purchased by business and used by business. If the product damages a consumer's property due to a defect in that product, the consumer can bring a claim.

## Defences

A party can avoid liability if one of the defences set out in [s 4 CPA 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43/section/4) applies.

The most important defences are that

- the defect did not exist in the product at the relevant time (s 4(1)(d))
- Development risks defence: the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the relevant time (the time at which the product was put into circulation) was not such that a producer of products of the same description might be expected to have discovered the defect if it existed in his products while they were under his control (s 4(1)(e)).

Some argument whether s 4(1)(e) introduces a back-door. But note that if a manufacturer is aware of the defect, but the state of scientific/technical knowledge is such that the defect cannot be **fixed**, then this will not be a defence to a claim.

s 6(4): contributory negligence is available as a defence.

## Exemption Clauses

s 7: prohibits any exclusion or limitation of liability under the provisions of the Act.

## Limitation

The claim must be brought within **three years** of the latter of:

- The date the injury/ damage occurred
- When the claimant became aware, or should reasonably have become aware of the damage ([s 11A(4) Limitation Act 1980](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/11A)).

There is a long stop of **ten years** after the product was put into circulation by the defendant (s 11A(3) LA 1980), representing an absolute defence to such actions after this time.

Note also that where the loss is anything other than personal injury, the tort of negligence allows **6 years** (under [Limitations Act 1980](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/contents))

## Further Points

- Protection is not limited to people who purchased the product, or people who used the product. Anyone suffering damage can sue.
- In negligence, foreseeability of harm is necessary to establish a duty of care and to establish liability. Not the case in relation to the Act.
- The causation requirement is that the damage was caused 'wholly or partly' by the defect (s 2(1)). Simpler than the causation aspect of a negligence claim.
- s 3(1) demands a higher responsibility than the standard of care in negligence.
