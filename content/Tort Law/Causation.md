# Causation

- To what extent must defendant's breach be cause of the claimant's loss
- Case of multiple potential causes?
- Any policy/ other reasons to justify denying liability?

Once breach is established, next step is to prove that the breach caused the damage. Without this, claim with fail.

Two points to consider:

- [[Factual causation]] --> establishing link between breach and damage
- [[Legal causation]] --> considering whether there are any grounds upon which the link should be regarded as having been broken
