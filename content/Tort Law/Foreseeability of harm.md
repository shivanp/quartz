# Foreseeability of harm

This is the test of whether a particular event was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the act or omission which caused it to occur. It is an objective standard, although it must be decided in relation to the person to whom it is applied. For instance, it was obvious that Borstal boys doing work on an island in Poole Harbour might, if not prevented, attempt to steal a yacht and thereby do damage to it ([[Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd [1970] AC 1004]]).

 Note that this requirement was also required by the test in [[Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728]]. An example of principle is the case of [[Haley v London Electricity Board [1965] AC 778]].

Harm which has found to not be reasonably foreseeable includes

- damage to tomato plants caused by toxin residues in water supplied by the defendant which met current drinking water standards ([[Hamilton v Papakura DC [2002] UKPC 9]]); and
- contamination of a spinal anaesthetic caused by invisible cracks in a vial - the state of scientific knowledge at the time made such cracks (and the consequent contamination) unforeseeable ([[Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 QB 66]]).

This is generally a broad test, of whether the general type of harm suffered could have been reasonably foreseen.
