# Occupiers' liability

## Introduction

Occupiers' liability is concerned with loss caused by the state or condition of the premises, or things done or omitted to be done during the occupation of such premises. It represents an extension to the traditional rules of negligence and is largely covered by statute.

[[Goldman v Hargrave [1967] 1 AC 645]] demonstrates that a person may be liable for an omission if the danger arose from his or her own land. However, where the danger has actually been created by another, the mere failure of the occupier to intervene will not necessarily attract a duty of care over and above that assumed by the creator of the danger ([[Lambert v Barratt Homes Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 681]]). Liability will only attach to the occupier if they have knowingly allowed the risk to exist or continue ([[Clark Fixing Ltd v Dudley MBC [2001] EWCA Civ 1898]])

## Statutes

- The [Occupiers' Liability Act 1957](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/31/contents) (OLA 1957) governs the duty owed by occupiers to visitors.
- The [Occupiers' Liability Act 1984](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/3/contents) (OLA 1984) governs the duty owed by occupiers to non-visitors.

These statutes stand alongside common law.

See [[Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957]] and [[Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984]].

## Public and Private Rights of Way

- Those using a public right of way are covered by neither OLA 1957 nor OLA 1984, so are reliant on common law.
- The use of a private right of way is covered by OLA 1984.
- Those exercising their rights under the [National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/97) are not regarded as visitors under OLA 1957, but are owed a duty under OLA 1984.
- Much of the law in this area has been codified in [Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/37/contents).

## Occupiers Liability and Exclusion Clauses

s 2(1) OLA 1957 allows an occupier, in so far as they are free to do so, to extend, restrict, modify or exclude their duty to visitors.

But there are four restrictions on the occupier's freedom to use an exclusion clause to exclude or lessen their liability to the visitor:

- [s 3 OLA 1957](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/31/section/3)
- [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]]
- [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]]
- Common law

### S 3 OLA 1957

This states that the occupier cannot, by contract, exclude or restrict the common duty of care which they owe to a third party.

Section | Effect
---|---
[s 3(1) OLA 1957](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/31/section/3) | Where an occupier is bound by a contract to allow people who are strangers to the contract to enter or use the premises, the duty of care that the occupier owes those strangers as their visitors cannot be restricted or excluded by the contract.
[s 3(3) OLA 1957](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/31/section/3) | A stranger to the contract is defined as someone who is not entitled to the benefit of the contract, for example by not being a party or a successor.

The purpose of s 3(1) is to protect employees of a person with whom the occupier has contracted. If the occupier has contracted with X for X's employees to do work on the occupier's premises, the occupier may not restrict or exclude any liability to them under OLA 1957.

Any term of the contract which obliges the occupier to increase the level of care shown to these employees will establish the standard of care to be shown.

### UCTA 1977

[UCTA 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/contents) restricts the use of exclusion clauses/notices to exclude or limit liability for negligence, which includes breach of duty under the OLA 1957. UCTA 1977 applies to 'business to business' liability, i.e. where the occupier is using the premises for business purposes and the person entering the premises is doing so in the exercise of a trade, business, craft, or profession.

Section | Effect
---|---
[s 2(1) UCTA 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/section/2) | A person cannot exclude/restrict their liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence.
[s 2(2) UCTA 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/section/2) | In relation to other loss, a person can exclude/restrict their liability for negligence if the term/notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.
[s 11 UCTA 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/section/11) | The ‘requirement of reasonableness’ means it should be fair and reasonable to allow reliance on the notice, having regard to all the circumstances at the time when the liability would have arisen. See [[Pure economic loss#Negligent statements]].

### CRA 2015

[CRA 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents/enacted) restricts the use of exclusion clauses/notices to exclude or limit liability for negligence, which includes breach of duty under the OLA 1957. The CRA 2015 applies where the defendant is acting as a trader (i.e., for purposes relating to their trade, business, craft or profession) and the claimant, as a consumer (i.e., for purposes wholly or mainly outside their trade, business, craft or profession).

Section | Effect
---|---
[s 65(1) CRA 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/65/enacted) | A trader cannot exclude/restrict their liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence.
[s 62(1) and 62(2) CRA 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/62/enacted) | In relation to other loss, a trader can exclude/restrict their liability for negligence if the term/notice is fair.
[s 62(4) and 62(6) CRA 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/62/enacted) | A term/notice is unfair “if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer”.
[s 62(5) and 62(7) CRA 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/62/enacted) | When determining fairness of the above, take into account the nature of the subject matter, and reference to all circumstances existing at the relevant time.
[Schedule 2 CRA 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/schedule/2/enacted) | More guidance on unfairness of contract terms.

### Common Law Restrictions

If neither UCTA 1977 nor CRA 2015 applies (e.g., the defendant is a private occupier), for any type of loss suffered by the claimant, such restrictions could be judged against the principle of 'common humanity' given in [[British Railway Board v Herrington [1972] AC 877]].

This represents the minimum legal standard of care, which can never be excluded by agreement or notice.

> Would a conscientious person with the defendant's knowledge, skill, and resources be reasonably expected to have done something which would have helped avoid the accident?

### OLA 1984 exclusion/ Limitation Clauses

The OLA 1984 is silent as to whether it is possible to exclude liability. Two arguments:

1. OLA 1984 lays down a bare minimum that cannot be evaded
2. If this were the case, then it would be unfair as trespassers would be in a better position than lawful visitors, which is contrary to the policy of OLA 1984.

Likely that the same common law restriction applies as to OLA 1957, but that the provisions of UCTA 1977 and CRA 2015 would not apply.
