# Fair, just and reasonable

## Features

Involves a broad analysis of the impact of a decision on society as a whole. These policy considerations include:

- [[Floodgates]]
- [[Civil Litigation/Tort Law/Definitions/Insurance]]
- [[Crushing liability]]
- Deterrence
- Maintenance of high standards
- [[Defensive practices]]

## Case Law

It has been argued that this leaves the courts with an inevitable residual discretion as to whether or not a duty of care should be recognised.

- In [[Marc Rich & Co v Bishop Rock Marine Co Ltd [1996] AC 211]] the House of Lords denied a duty of care on the basis that it was not fair, just and reasonable to disturb the contractual allocation of risks between the claimant and shipowner, which might threaten [[Terms]] under which international trade normally conducted
- In [[Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales [2015] UKSC 2]] Lord Kerr (in dissent) argued that whether or not to impose a duty of care was informed not only by policy considerations, but that these might change over time. Argued that it was time to impose a duty of care on the police.
- In [[Nettleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691]], Lord Denning said that one of the key reasons why it was reasonable to impose such a duty on the defendant was because she was insured.
- In [[XA v YA [2010] EWHC 1983 (QB)]] the court found that it would not be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on a mother who had failed to prevent her son from being assaulted by his father over a period of years.

## Commentary

The first catch-all test is obviously hardest to define. Broad legal principles brought to bear on the specific area of duty of care.
