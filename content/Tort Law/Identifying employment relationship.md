# Identifying employment relationship

## Introduction

The relationship of an employer/ employee is one where there is a 'contract of service'. Contrast with the employer/ independent contractor relationship, where there is a 'contract for services'.

Important to identify employment relationships:

- The duty of care offered to employees is higher than for other workers; case law relating to employees will not automatically apply to other workers
- [[Vicarious liability]] requires employer/ employee relationship or a relationship akin to this

## Identifying Employment Relationship

'Multiple factors' or 'economic reality' test from [[Ready Mixed Concrete v Minister of Pensions [1968] 2 QB 497]]. Three-part approach when considering whether there is an employment relationship:

- Remuneration in exchange for personal service and mutuality of obligations
- Control
- All other contractual factors consistent with an employment relationship.

Generally, there will be an employment relationship if the company exerts a high degree of control over the worker, and the worker is paid in exchange for their services.

### Remuneration

Employee paid in full to fulfil their duties personally. If the worker has unfettered right to send a substitute in their place (and the employer has no rule in choosing that substitute), it does not count as an employment relationship.

Mutuality of obligations means the employer is required to provide work to the employee and the employee is required to do the work. In a 'zero hours contract' the absence of mutuality of obligations means the worker is unlikely to be deemed an employee.

The first stage of the test from _Ready Mixed_ focuses on remuneration in exchange for personal service â€“ regular remuneration (not just a fixed salary) is evidence of being an employee.

### Control

The more control the employer has, the less likely the other party counts as an employee. Consider:

- Who has control over tasks to be done
- Way in which tasks done
- When and where work completed

### Other Contractual Factors

Other factors pointing towards and employer/ employee relationship are:

- Tools and equipment provided by the employer
- Tax/ PAYE treatment as an employee
- The employee being 'integrated' into the organisation
- Party labelling relationship as employment relationship (though this is not conclusive)
- Benefits like holiday and sick pay

## Relationship Akin to Employment

In certain circumstances, an employer can be vicariously liable for torts committed by an employee. After 2012: can also be [[Vicarious liability]] in relationships akin to employment relationship (only used in doubtful cases).

Recent case: [[Barclays Bank Plc v Various Claimants [2020] UKSC 13]] held that bank was not vicariously liable.

### Test for Relationship Akin to Employment

Where the tortfeasor is not carrying out their own independent business, the question is whether the relationship is sufficiently analogous to employment to make it fair, just and reasonable to impose [[Vicarious liability]]. This is more likely if:

1. The employer is more likely to have the means to compensate the claimant than the tortfeasor
2. Tort has been committed as a result of an activity undertaken by the tortfeasor on the employer's behalf
3. Tortfeasor's activity is part of the business activity of employer
4. By allowing tortfeasor to carry on activity, employer created the risk of the tort being committed (this is meant quite loosely - e.g. by allowing person to work in the shop, allowed tort to be committed).
5. Tortfeasor is under the control of the employer.

Note this test comes from Christian brothers case: [[Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56]]

e.g., in [[Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10]] prison service found to be vicariously liable for torts of a prisoner working within the catering section of the prison. Here the test from Christian bros was applied.

A high degree of control is not necessary for an employment relationship ([[Armes v Nottingham County Council [2017] UKSC 60]]).

Uber case: [[Uber BV v Aslam [2018] EWCA Civ 2748]]

General rule: the original employer will remain vicariously liable, and it will be difficult for them to rebut this presumption ([[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffiths [1947] AC 1]]). Courts place emphasis on the level of control the hirer has over the worker and the provision of equipment.

Possible for both X and Y to be vicariously liable ([[Viasystems Ltd v Thermal Transfer Ltd and Others [2005] EWCA Civ 1151]]) though this is rare. Occurs when both employers are entitled and obliged to control the employee's actions so as to prevent the negligent act.
