# Robinson v The Post Office [1974] 2 All ER 737

The claimant was injured through the defendant's negligence and was given an anti-tetanus injection, to which he was allergic (causing the claimant to suffer to a greater extent than he otherwise would have done). The doctor should have carried out an allergy test before administering the injection. This did not break the chain of causation as it was **not regarded as 'palpably wrong'.** The doctor's actions were **foreseeable**. The defendant was liable for the claimant's initial injuries and the extent to which they were made worse by the doctorâ€™s actions.
