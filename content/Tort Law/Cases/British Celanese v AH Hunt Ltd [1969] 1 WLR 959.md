# British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd [1969] 1 WLR 959

Metal foil strips blown from the defendant’s factory came into contact with an electricity sub-station, causing a power failure which stopped the claimant’s machines. The claimant alleged that the defendant knew or ought to have known of the likely consequences of the escape because a similar occurrence had taken place three years ago and the defendant had received a warning from the electricity board. The court held that this isolated incident could create a nuisance, especially as it was not the first occurrence. The persistent habit of storing the metal strips outside of the factory provided the continuance.

As regards remoteness of damage, there is no difference in principle between physical injury resulting in loss of profits and personal injury resulting in loss of earnings. P claimed damages against D, manufacturers of electrical components, alleging that in December 1964 metal foil strips blown from D's factory on the same industrial estate as P's factory came into contact with an electricity sub-station on the estate, causing a power failure which halted P's machines, resulted in material in them solidifying, necessitated the cleaning of the machines, and wasted materials and time. P alleged D knew or ought to have known of the likely consequences of the escape because a similar occurrence had taken place in 1961 and D had received a warning from the electricity board. P claimed damages under four heads –  
(a) strict liability under Rylands v Fletcher  
(b) negligence;  
(c) nuisance; and  
(d) public nuisance.

D contended that nothing more than a damnum absque injuria was revealed. On the trial of a preliminary issue whether on the facts set out in the statement of claim, D was in law liable for the damage claimed, held,

(1) that the claim under head (a) failed because there was no non-natural user of the land;  
(2) as to (b) that D owed a duty to P in the circumstances to prevent the metal foil being blown about so as to foul the sub-station and that, as to remoteness of damage, there was no difference between the present case of alleged physical injury with consequential loss of profits and the ordinary case of a plaintiff suffering physical injury and losing earnings; and  
(3) that as to (c) and (d), an isolated happening by itself could create an actionable nuisance and so, as P was directly and foreseeably affected, P had a good cause of action against D in nuisance.
