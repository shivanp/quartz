# Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority [1988] AC 1074

#key-case

## Facts

An infant was delivered prematurely and shortly after was administered oxygen by a junior doctor, accidentally providing too much. The baby was later diagnosed with a retinal condition, which severely limited his sight. Five potential causes or factors were identified to explain the condition, four relating to his premature birth and the fifth being the junior doctor’s actions.  

## Issues

Whether the health authority for which the junior doctor worked could be held liable for his actions where it could not be definitively stated what the chief cause of the injury was. Moreover, should a junior doctor be held to the same professional standards as a fully qualified doctor. Further, should the burden of proof regarding the potential relationship between the negligent actions and the injuries fall to the claimant or the defendant.

## Decision/Outcome

At first instance the Court found the defendant, Essex Area Health Authority, liable for the infant’s injuries, citing _McGhee v National Coal Board_ [1973] 1 WLR 1 as laying down the precedent that where there existed a plurality of possible causes, the burden fell to the defendant to prove that their actions had not been the but for or material cause of the injury.

The House of Lords subsequently allowed the defendant’s appeal and overturned the first instance judgment stating that whilst the health authority could be held liable for the junior doctor’s actions as junior doctors owed the same duty of care as a fully qualified doctor, the case of _McGhee_ had been wrongly interpreted at first instance; regardless of the number of potential causes of injury, it always falls to the claimant to establish the likelihood of causation.

## Abstract

The onus of proving causation in a medical negligence case rested on the plaintiff. Where a medical condition could have been caused by a number of different factors, the defendants' failure to take steps which could have caused one of them did not prove the causation. The plaintiff was born prematurely and was placed in a special baby care unit at a hospital managed by the defendants. The plaintiff needed oxygen but a catheter was wrongly inserted into an umbilical vein as opposed to an artery and the plaintiff was supersaturated with oxygen.

He developed retrolental fibroplasia which resulted in blindness. A likely cause of the condition but not a definite or the only cause was that he had been administered too much oxygen. He claimed damages from the defendant health authority for negligent medical treatment. The judge held that the defendants were liable since they had failed to prove that the plaintiff's condition had not been caused by the negligence of their employees. The Court of Appeal dismissed the defendants' appeal.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the **onus of proof of causation rested on the plaintiffs**. Where a number of different factors could have caused the condition, including the administration of excess oxygen, its occurrence provided no evidence and raised no presumption that it was excess oxygen rather than one of the other factors which caused or contributed to the condition. Since there was a conflict of medical evidence as to whether the excess oxygen caused or contributed to the plaintiff's condition and the judge had failed to make relevant findings of fact on this, the issue of causation was remitted to a different judge to try (_[Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw [1956] A.C. 613, [1956] 3 WLUK 6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I768F6F21E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4c1d88c357eb4c3790dd385c6a285fad&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[McGhee v National Coal Board [1973] 1 W.L.R. 1, [1972] 11 WLUK 68](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF597E180E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4c1d88c357eb4c3790dd385c6a285fad&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished). The Court of Appeal was not itself entitled to resolve a conflict between the experts which the judge had left unresolved, namely whether the defendants' actions were capable of causing or contributing to his condition.
