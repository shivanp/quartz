# Tedstone v Bourne Leisure Ltd [2008] EWCA Civ 654

A woman slipped on a small patch of water on her way from the jacuzzi to the swimming pool. The defendant had taken reasonable care to ensure she was reasonably safe; regular inspections were carried out and the patch of water had not been there long. A reasonable occupier would not have done more.
