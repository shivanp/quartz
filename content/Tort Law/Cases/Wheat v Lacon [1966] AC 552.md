# Wheat v Lacon [1966] AC 552

The defendants were owners of a pub. They granted the managers a licence to use the top floor of the premises for their private accommodation and to take in paying guests. The claimant and her husband were paying guests in the top floor premises. The husband was fatally injured while using the staircase, which had a faulty handrail. He could not see this as the area had no lighting. Who was the occupier of the stairs?

The owners and managers were occupiers and both owed a duty of care. In the event, neither were liable because the fatality was caused partly as a result of a light bulb having been removed by a third party, over which the occupiers had no control, and there was no reason before the accident to consider that the handrail was dangerous. Lord Denning stated that:

> “wherever a person has a sufficient degree of control over premises that he ought to realise that any failure on his part to use care may result in injury to a person coming lawfully there, then he is an occupier.”

Lord Denning divided ‘occupiers’ into four categories:

(1) If the landlord does not live on the property, the tenant is the occupier;  
(2) If the landlord retains some part of the premises, e.g., common areas like stairways, they are the occupier of those parts;  
(3) If the landlord issues a licence, they remain an occupier (as in **_Wheat_**); and  
(4) If the occupier employs an independent contractor, they generally remain responsible.

This case also led to multiple occupiers thing
