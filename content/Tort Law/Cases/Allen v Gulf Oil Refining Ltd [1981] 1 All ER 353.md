# Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd [1981] 1 All ER 353

A private Act of Parliament provided for the expansion of an oil refinery in part of Wales. Residents complained of the noise and vibrations caused by the operation of the refinery. A majority in the House of Lords held that the refineryâ€™s operations were authorised by statute and the nuisance was inevitable. This acted as a full defence.
