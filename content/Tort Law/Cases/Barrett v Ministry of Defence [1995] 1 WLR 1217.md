# Barrett v Ministry of Defence [1995] 1 WLR 1217

## Facts

The claimant’s husband was in the Navy stationed at a remote base in Norway. One night he was celebrating his 30th birthday and a recent promotion by drinking with his friends in the bar provided at the Naval base. It was a Friday night which was a night on which the men would generally indulge in heavy drinking. The bar was putting on an Hawain night and duty free alcohol was available. The claimant’s husband was drinking heavily and was involved in a drinking competition and became extremely drunk to the point where he passed out. He was carried to a chair in the lobby. A senior officer saw him and told Petty Officer Wells to take him back to his cabin and look after him. He was taken back and placed in his bunk and left in the recovery position. He was in a coma but tossing and turning. The Petty Officer checked on him on two occasions but he was then found dead at 2.30am. At trial the judge held that the MOD were liable for his death because of the relaxed attitude towards excessive drinking at the base, in that it was common for officers to drink heavily and rules and penalties relating to alcohol consumption were not being enforced. The damages were reduced by 25% under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence Act) 1945. The MOD appealed on the grounds that no duty of care should arise to prevent a person becoming intoxicated.

## Held

The MOD were liable, not through breach of a duty of care to prevent him becoming dangerously intoxicated, Until the deceased became unconscious, he alone carried the legal responsibility for his own actions, however, once the senior officer assumed a responsibility for him by ordering the Petty Officer to look after him a duty of care did arise. He was in breach of duty by failing to ensure the deceased received the appropriate supervision.

### Abstract

P was the widow and executrix of the deceased who had been a naval airman who died after becoming so drunk at a naval base that he passed into a coma and asphyxiated on his own vomit. The deceased's commanding officer was charged with an offence under Naval regulations imposing a duty on officers to discourage drunkenness and to take appropriate action to prevent injury or fatality. P brought an action suing the Navy in negligence of the basis that it owed a duty of care to the serviceman. There was evidence adduced of widespread laxity in the enforcement of regulations requiring the control of heavy drinking. It was alleged that the Navy had failed to impose discipline and that it had failed to provide adequate medical care for the deceased. The trial judge equated the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy 1967 with safety regulations in factories in deciding for P but also finding that the deceased had been guilty of contributory negligence.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that

(1) the judge had been wrong to equate the Queen's Regulations with safety codes in factories because the purpose of the regulations was to preserve discipline and good order in the Navy and was in no sense intended to create standards or give advice with reference to reasonable care for the safety of men when drinking off-duty. The regulations could not therefore be invoked directly in deciding whether a duty of care was owed and whether the defendant was in breach of it;

(2) the mere existence of regulatory or public duties does not of itself create a special relationship imposing a duty of care in law for the safety of others. The characteristic which distinguished those special relationships was the element of reliance, expressed or implied in the relationship, which the party to whom the duty was owed was entitled to place on the other party to make provision for his safety. New duties to take care for others should be developed incrementally and by analogy with established categories. It was neither justified nor reasonable to blame one adult for another adult's lack of self-control. No one was better placed to judge the amount which he could consume than the individual himself. Therefore the deceased was the only person responsible at law for his collapse, _[Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd [1970] A.C. 1004, [1970] 5 WLUK 19](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC3259AD0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=563926d9a7e74250a340e21a184eb330&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Anns v Merton LBC [1978] A.C. 728, [1977] 5 WLUK 94](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5E758AF0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=563926d9a7e74250a340e21a184eb330&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered, and

(3) however, once the deceased had collapsed and was no longer capable of looking after himself, it was accepted that the defendant's care for him had been inadequate. The defendant had a duty of care towards the deceased and was liable for damages to that extent. The deceased's contributory negligence should be raised to twothirds in these circumstances.
