# Esterhuizen v Allied Dunbar Assurance plc, Times, June 10, 1998

Held, that the principle in White v Jones [1995] 2 A.C. 207, [1995] 2 WLUK 278, that a solicitor instructed to draw up a will could owe a duty of care to an intended beneficiary under the proposed will where the loss of a legacy was reasonably foreseeable, applied equally to a company which held itself out as offering a similar will making service to that of a solicitor.
