# Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1991] 4 All ER 907

#key-case

This case concerned the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster in which, as a result of the negligence of the police, 96 people were crushed to death and over 400 physically injured. Thousands of people watched the tragedy on live television, listened to it on the radio and/or saw later press coverage. The potential number of psychiatric claims was huge. Claims were brought by various relatives and friends of the victims of the disaster who were either present at the football ground or witnessed events on television or heard about it on the radio. None of the claimants had been within the foreseeable range of physical injury and as such could not claim as primary victims. Instead, they argued that they had suffered psychiatric harm as a result of what they saw happen to and/or feared had happened to their friend/relative. They were secondary victims. **No duty of care was owed to any of the claimants as they lacked proximity of relationship and/or proximity in time and space.**

## Abstract

There was no duty of care to the friends and relations of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster, who watched the event on television. D was responsible for policing a football match at the Hillsborough stadium where, as a result of overcrowding, 95 people died and many more were injured. Live pictures of the event, an FA Cup semi-final, were being broadcast. Plaintiffs were all friends or relations of the victims. Some witnessed events from other parts of the stadium. Some saw them live on television, or heard of the events and later saw them on television recordings. All suffered shock and psychiatric illness and claimed damages in negligence from D. At first instance, the judge held that nine Ps who had been in or immediately outside the stadium or had watched it live on television could claim damages, but others were excluded. The Court of Appeal allowed D's appeal.

Held, dismissing Ps' appeal, that

(1) to establish a claim for psychiatric illness resulting from shock it was necessary to show that the injury was reasonably foreseeable, and the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant was sufficiently proximate. The proximation did not depend on there being particular relationships such as husband and wife, but was based on ties of love and affection, the closeness of which needed to be proved in each case. Remoter relationships needed careful scrutiny. A plaintiff had to show propinquity in time and space to the accident or its immediate aftermath, and

(2) in the case of Ps present at the match, the mere fact of the relationship was insufficient to give rise to a duty of care; and the viewing of the event on television was not equivalent to being within sight and hearing of the event or its immediate aftermath, dicta of Lord Wilberforce in _[McLoughlin v O'Brian [1983] 1 A.C. 410, [1982] 5 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7E61740E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b432459cdd674daa8d9e3af582fa6d4e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, _[Hevican v Ruane [1991] 3 All E.R. 65, [1990] 12 WLUK 281](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I65828370E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b432459cdd674daa8d9e3af582fa6d4e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Ravenscroft v Rederi AB Transatlantic [1991] 3 All E.R. 73, [1991] 3 WLUK 390](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I96C83100E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b432459cdd674daa8d9e3af582fa6d4e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ doubted.
