# Manchester Building Society v Grant Thornton UK LLP [2021] UKSC 20

The defendant auditors were asked to advise the claimant building society on whether the building society could use hedge accounting to implement its business model within the constraints of the regulatory environment. The auditors advised that the building society could, and so the building society implemented its business model. The advice was incorrect — the building society were exposed to regulatory capital demands which the hedge accounting was supposed to avoid. This led to the claimant suffering pure economic loss.

The Supreme Court held that the scope of the duty of care assumed by a professional adviser was governed by the purpose of the duty — **why was the advice given**. What risk was the duty supposed to protect against and did the loss represent fruition of that risk? Applying the facts, the defendant auditors owed the claimants a duty of care. The **purpose of their advice** was to do with the issue of hedge accounting within the context of its implications for the building society’s regulatory capital. The loss suffered related to this purpose and so fell within the scope of the defendant’s duty of care (ie the claimant suffered a loss which fell within the scope of the duty assumed by the defendant when taking into account the purpose for which the advice was given). This is like **_Caparo_**– the purpose of the auditing report was to allow shareholders to make informed decisions about their rights of control under the company’s constitution. The purpose did not relate to investment decisions.
