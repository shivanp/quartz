# Bux v Slough Metals [1974] 1 Lloyd's Rep 155

The claimant worker was splashed with molten metal, losing sight in one eye. His employer had complied with the statutory duty to provide safety goggles (i.e., the duty to provide safety equipment), but the court held that the duty at common law went further than this, **requiring the employer to encourage or insist on the wearing of the goggles**. This can be seen as part of providing and implementing a safe system of work. Whether instruction persuasion, or insistence should be used in relation to protective equipment depends on the facts of the case, in particular, **the nature and degree of the risk of serious harm that could result if it is not worn**. Where employees object or refuse to use safety equipment, an employer may not be negligent for failing to enforce the use of that safety equipment.

The claimant was found to be 40% to blame for his injuries when he failed to wear safety goggles provided by his employer.
