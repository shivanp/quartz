# Abouzaid v Mothercare (UK) Ltd, The Times, 20 February 2001

The claimant was injured when attaching a 'cosytoes' (a fleece-lined sleeping bag) to a pushchair — an elastic strap sprung into his eye, causing partial loss of vision. The product was held to be defective because ‘it was supplied with a design which permitted the risk [of losing control of an elastic strap which might injure a person’s eyes] to arise and without giving a warning’. The public was entitled to expect more from the manufacturer. Strict liability under the Act.

Mother also sued in general negligence. This claim failed, because the defendants could show that they had tested the product, and when testing no issues had arose. So they could establish that they had taken reeasonable care.
