# Yianni v Edwin Evans [1982] QB 438

A first-time buyer relied on a building society valuation survey, even though expressly told not to. However, it was held that it was reasonable for the claimant to rely on the building society valuation survey rather than a full structural survey as the claimant was a first-time buyer and purchasing a house of modest value. These facts meant the building society could reasonably have expected the claimant to rely on their survey as the claimant was unlikely to be able to afford a full structural survey.
