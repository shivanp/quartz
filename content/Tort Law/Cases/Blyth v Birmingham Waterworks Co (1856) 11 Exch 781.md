# Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co (1856) 11 Exch 781

## Facts

The defendant was a water supply company. By statute, they were under an obligation to lay pipes and gratuitously provide fire-plugs for putting out fires. There were strict statutory requirements for how the pipes and plugs should be laid. The defendants complied with these requirements, and otherwise constructed the plugs according the best-practice requirements of the time. However, due to extreme cold during one of the coldest winters on record, a fire-plugs came loose. This caused flooding which filled the claimant’s house with water. The County Court held the defendant liable in the tort of negligence for the damage to the claimant’s house. The defendant appealed.

## Issue(s)

1. Had the defendant breached their duty of care in negligence?
