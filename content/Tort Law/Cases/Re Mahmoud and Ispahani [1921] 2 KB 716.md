The claimant agreed to supply a quantity of linseed oil to the defendant. Under statute a licence was required to deal in linseed oil. The defendant did not have the required licence to receive the linseed oil. The defendant later refused to take delivery of the linseed oil. The claimantâ€™s action for damages for breach of contract failed because the contract was illegal and void.
