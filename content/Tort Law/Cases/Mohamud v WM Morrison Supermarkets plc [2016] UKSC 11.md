# Mohamud v WM Morrison Supermarkets plc [2016] UKSC 11

#key-case

Morrisons was vicariously liable for the assault and battery perpetrated by one of its employees, Mr Khan, on a customer, Mr Mohamud, which happened on the forecourt of Morrisons petrol station.

Mr Khan's job was to serve customers and answer their inquiries. When Mr Mohamud approached the kiosk with an inquiry, Mr Khan's rude response was clearly 'closely connected' with his duties (responding to inquiries). The verbal, racial and physical abuse that ensued as Mr Khan followed Mr Mohamud to the forecourt and his car was held to be a 'seamless episode', an unbroken sequence of events that started with an act that was closely connected to his employment duties. The abuse was not an act of personal vengeance, and as Morrisons had entrusted Mr Khan to deal with members of the public it was held to be just that they should be responsible for his abuse of trust.

## Summary

There was nothing wrong with the "close connection" test of vicarious liability adumbrated in _[Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22, [2002] 1 A.C. 215, [2001] 5 WLUK 105](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE1A0CC01E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and the law would not be improved by a change of vocabulary. Applying that test, the employer of a petrol kiosk attendant who had subjected a customer to an unprovoked assault was liable for his actions.

## Abstract

A supermarket customer appealed against a decision (_[[2014] EWCA Civ 116](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I319D7E60950F11E38542CB2A941F0346/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_) that the respondent supermarket was not vicariously liable for an assault perpetrated by one of its employees.

The customer had attended a petrol station kiosk run by the supermarket and had approached one of the staff members (K) with an enquiry. K, whose job was to serve customers and see that the petrol pumps and kiosk were kept in good running order, responded with foul-mouthed abuse and ordered the customer to leave. He then followed him onto the forecourt where he told him to keep away and subjected him to a violent and unprovoked assault. The customer brought proceedings against the supermarket, claiming that it was vicariously liable for the assault.

The trial judge held that it was not liable because there was no sufficiently close connection between the assault and what K was employed to do. The Court of Appeal upheld his decision, finding that while K's employment involved interaction with customers, that was insufficient to fix the supermarket with vicarious liability for his violence: his duties did not involve him being placed in situations where there was a clear possibility of confrontation.

The customer submitted that there should be a new test of vicarious liability in which the courts applied a "representative capacity" rather than a "close connection" test. He argued that the question should be whether a reasonable observer would consider the employee to be acting in the capacity of a representative of the employer at the time of committing the tort.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) After reviewing the development of the doctrine of vicarious liability, the court indicated that the "close connection" test adumbrated in _[Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2001] UKHL 22, [2002] 1 A.C. 215, [2001] 5 WLUK 105](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE1A0CC01E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] UKHL 48, [2003] 2 A.C. 366, [2002] 12 WLUK 137](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9B82A9A0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ had been followed in a line of cases, including several at the highest level. There was a risk in attempting to lay down criteria for determining what precisely amounted to a sufficiently close connection to make it just for an employer to be held vicariously liable.

A simplification of the essence was more desirable, and in its simplest terms, two matters had to be considered:  
(a) what functions had been entrusted by the employer to the employee (which had to be addressed broadly); and  
(b) whether there was sufficient connection between the employee's wrongful conduct and the position in which he was employed to make it right for the employer to be fixed with vicarious liability.

The cases in which the necessary connection had been found to exist were those in which the employee had used or misused his position in a way which injured the third party, _[Lloyd v Grace Smith & Co [1912] A.C. 716, [1912] 7 WLUK 87](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE1F1AB20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Pettersson v Royal Oak Hotel [1948] N.Z.L.R. 136, [1948] 1 WLUK 278](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I80883CF0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Warren v Henlys Ltd [1948] 2 All E.R. 935, [1948] 11 WLUK 39](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA8D92160E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. There was nothing wrong with the close connection test as such and the law would not be improved by a change of vocabulary, Lister and Dubai Aluminium followed (see paras [42- 46](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment). The test should only be abrogated or refined if a demonstrably better test could be devised. However, the proposed "representative capacity" test was hopelessly vague. Moreover, while the instant court had suggested in _[Various Claimants v Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools [2012] UKSC 56, [2013] 2 A.C. 1, [2012] 11 WLUK 630](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID0E3BBA033E111E29330CAD9B8CE3816/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ that the law of vicarious liability was on the move, such change was a response to changes in the legal relationships between enterprises and members of their workforces, Christian Brothers referred to. There had been no changes in societal conditions requiring a change in the law governing the circumstances in which an employer should be held vicariously liable for the torts of an employee (paras [53-55](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(2) It was K's job to attend to customers and respond to their inquiries. His conduct in answering the claimant's request in a foul-mouthed way and ordering him to leave was inexcusable but was within the field of activities assigned to him. What happened thereafter was an unbroken sequence of events. It was not right to regard K as having metaphorically taken off his uniform when he followed the customer onto the forecourt. Moreover, once on the forecourt, K had repeated his order to leave. That was not something personal between him and the customer; he was ordering him to keep away from his employer's premises, and he reinforced that order by violence. **In doing so he was purporting to act in the furtherance of his employer's business. While it was a gross abuse of his position, it was in connection with the business in which he was employed.** Since the supermarket had entrusted him with the position of serving customers it was just that it should be held responsible for his abuse of that position. Finally, it was irrelevant that it looked as if K was motivated by personal racism rather than a desire to benefit his employer's business (paras [47-49, 57](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) Although the claims and issues in the instant case were separate from those in _[Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10, [2016] A.C. 660, [2016] 3 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I65B75A40E06211E59DDDADF5CA0D0D31/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a03a8433466e4dba8e51857e0584f8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_, that and the instant judgment were intended to be complementary in their legal analysis. The instant court agreed with the reasoning and conclusion of Lord Reed in that case (para.[1](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
