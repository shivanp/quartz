# Spencer v Wincanton Holdings Ltd (Wincanton Logistics Ltd) CA 21 Dec 2009

The claimant suffered injury for which he sought compensation from his employers. He later had to have his leg amputated as a consequence, but then through his own inadvertence suffered further injury to his other leg and a complete loss of mobility. He said that he would not have suffered the further injury but for the original one.  

Held: The defendant’s appeal failed.

>‘The apportionment of blame speaks clearly against a finding either that Mr Spencer acted recklessly or that it was unfair to treat the chain of causation as surviving his fall. Like the amputation, the fall was, on the judge’s findings, an unexpected but real consequence of the original accident, albeit one to which Mr Spencer’s own misjudgement contributed.’

>Applying the test in McKew, the question was whether the claimants was unreasonable. However ”unreasonable’ is a protean adjective. Its nuances run from irrationality to simple incaution or unwisdom. It is helpful to locate its correct position on the scale of meanings by recalling that its purpose in this context is to determine the point at which the law regards a consequence as too remote.’

>‘Fairness, baldly stated, might be thought to take things little further than reasonableness. But what it does is acknowledge that a succession of consequences which in fact and in logic is infinite will be halted by the law when it becomes unfair to let it continue. In relation to tortious liability for personal injury, this point is reached when (though not only when) the claimant suffers a further injury which, while it would not have happened without the initial injury, has been in substance brought about by the claimant and not the tortfeasor.’

## Summary

An employer was liable for the injuries of a former employee who suffered an accident for which the employer was liable, had his leg amputated as a result, and then had a second accident because he only had one leg. The employee's contributory conduct towards the second accident had been below the standard of unreasonableness required to break the chain of causation following _[McKew v Holland & Hannen & Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd [1969] 3 All E.R. 1621, [1969] 11 WLUK 96](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF64A1A81E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=052f536d783448298b547884992d21a6&contextData=(sc.Search))_.

## Abstract

The appellant employer (W) appealed against a decision that it was liable for the injuries the respondent former employee (S) had sustained in an accident he had suffered several years after an accident he had suffered at work.

S had damaged his knee in a minor accident. His injury developed to the point that, three years later, his leg had to be amputated above the knee. W did not dispute its liability for the consequences of the accident, including the amputation. Eight months after the amputation, ==S filled his car at a petrol station without summoning help or steadying himself using sticks or his prosthesis==. He tripped and fell, doing further damage which confined him to a wheelchair permanently. S had earlier issued a claim against W in respect of the first accident, and damages in that claim were assessed after S had the second accident. W resisted the increase in the size of the claim attributable to the second accident, but the judge found that it was liable for the increase, subject to a one-third reduction to reflect S's contributory negligence.

W argued that the second accident had been caused by S's unreasonable conduct, meaning that, following _[McKew v Holland & Hannen & Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd [1969] 3 All E.R. 1621, [1969] 11 WLUK 96](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF64A1A81E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=052f536d783448298b547884992d21a6&contextData=(sc.Search))_, it should not be held liable for the injuries S had suffered in the second accident.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

The formulation in McKew was problematic in that "unreasonable" covered a wide range of meanings, McKew considered. The word's purpose in the instant context was to determine the point at which the law regarded a consequence as being too remote; that could help find its correct meaning.

Although remoteness had been explained in terms of foreseeability in the past, that was problematic; if anything, it was foreseeability that had to be explained in terms of remoteness, _[Simmons v British Steel Plc [2004] UKHL 20, 2004 S.C. (H.L.) 94, [2004] 4 WLUK 509](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA88CDE80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=052f536d783448298b547884992d21a6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. The rationale of the principle that an intervening event broke the chain of causation was fairness, _[Corr v IBC Vehicles Ltd [2008] UKHL 13, [2008] 1 A.C. 884, [2008] 2 WLUK 677](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC85593E1E5C211DC9420AAEB14C803F8/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=052f536d783448298b547884992d21a6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied, and the question of remoteness involved a value judgment, _[Kuwait Airways Corp v Iraqi Airways Co (No.6) [2002] UKHL 19, [2002] 2 A.C. 883, [2002] 5 WLUK 480](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID59E9BD0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=052f536d783448298b547884992d21a6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied. The degree of unreasonable conduct required by the McKew test was very high, _[Emeh v Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster AHA [1985] Q.B. 1012, [1984] 7 WLUK 265](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA14D5BF0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=052f536d783448298b547884992d21a6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied.

However, it was unhelpful to describe the later conduct required by the test as reckless or deliberate. The judge had found that ==S's conduct had fallen far below McKew unreasonableness==, and there was no good reason to go behind his judgment. If he had found S principally to blame, the case might have been closer to McKew. The apportionment of blame spoke clearly against a finding either that S had acted recklessly or that it was unfair to treat the chain of causation as surviving the second accident. Like the amputation, the second accident had been an unexpected but real consequence of the first accident, albeit one to which S's own misjudgement had contributed.
