# Barber v Somerset County Council [2004] UKHL 13

## Summary

A local authority was in breach of its duty to its employee to take reasonable care to avoid injuring his health where it had become aware that his difficulties at work were having an adverse effect on his mental health, but had taken no steps to help him.

## Abstract

B appealed against a decision ([2002] EWCA Civ 76, [2002] 2 All E.R. 1) that the local authority had not been in breach of its duty to take reasonable care to avoid injuring his health. B had been employed by the local authority as a teacher. In September 1995 there was a restructuring of staffing at the school at which B was employed, and B was told that in order to maintain his salary level he would have to take on further responsibilities. B worked between 61 and 70 hours per week, and often had to work in the evenings and at weekends. In February 1996 B spoke of "work overload" to the school's deputy headteacher, and made enquiries about taking early retirement. In May B was absent from work for three weeks, his absence certified by his GP as being due to stress and depression.

On his return to work B met with members of the school's senior management team and said that he was not coping with his workload and that the situation was becoming detrimental to his health. He was not met with an entirely sympathetic response and no steps were taken to assist him. B contacted his GP on a number of occasions about work related stress and in November 1996, after losing control and shaking a pupil, he left the school and did not return. Since that time B had been unable to work as a teacher, or to do any work other than undemanding part time work. The issue was whether the Court of Appeal had been right to conclude that the evidence before the trial judge did not sustain a finding that the school authorities ought to have foreseen that, if B continued with his existing workload, he was liable to develop a psychiatric illness.

Held, allowing the appeal (Lord Scott dissenting), that the issue of the breach of the local authority's duty of care to B was borderline. The trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, had concluded that the local authority had been in breach and there was insufficient reason for the Court of Appeal to set aside that finding.

The test was whether the local authority had fallen below the standard properly to be expected of a reasonable and prudent employer taking positive steps for the safety of his workers in the light of what he knew or ought to have known, _[Stokes v Guest Keen & Nettlefold (Bolt & Nuts) Ltd [1968] 1 W.L.R. 1776, [1968] 10 WLUK 16](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBFA494F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=83a849e871c74292b42414476ce0ba97&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The Court of Appeal had failed to give adequate weight to the fact that B, an experienced and conscientious teacher, had been absent for three weeks with no physical ailment, such absence having been certified by his GP as being due to stress and depression. The duty to take some action had arisen in June or July 1996 when B had seen members of the school's senior management team, and had continued so long as nothing had been done to help him. The senior management team should have made enquiries about B's problems and discovered what they could have done to ease them, and the fact that the school as a whole was facing severe problems, with all the teachers stressed and overworked, did not mean that there was nothing that could have been done to help B, _[Cross v Highlands & Islands Enterprise 2001 S.L.T. 1060, [2000] 12 WLUK 111](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9273EFE1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=83a849e871c74292b42414476ce0ba97&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.

The trial judge had been entitled to form the view that the school's senior management team were in a position of continuing breach of the employer's duty of care, and that had caused B's breakdown in November 1996. (Per Lord Scott) The Court of Appeal had accurately expressed the principles that ought to be applied where a complaint was made of psychiatric illness brought about by stress at work, and these principles were to be preferred to the decision in Stokes, which addressed the question of whether the employer had provided a safe system of work, rather than the problems of psychiatric illness caused by stress.
