# Dunnage v Randall [2015] EWCA Civ 673

## **Facts**:

Mr. Dunnage, the appellant, was a nephew of Mr. Randall. Suffering from a serious mental disorder, Mr. Randall soaked himself in the petrol and tried to set himself on fire. Mr. Dunnage tried to prevent his uncle from getting harmed. However, during the process Mr. Randall died and Mr. Dunnage got serious burns to his face and body. Mr. Dunnage brought an action for damages in negligence against Mr. Randall represented by his widow and against the insurance company of Mr. Randall’s house where the incident occurred.

## **Issues**:

Since Mr. Randall was suffering from a serious mental disorder, did he owe the duty of care to Mr. Dunnage? Was he liable in negligence?

### **Held:**

In Dunnage v Randall, the Court of Appeal allowed Mr. Dunnage’s appeal. The Court held that there was no rule in law that would restrict the court to find the person suffering from a mental disorder liable in negligence. As long as the defendant’s health problem mental or physical has not entirely eliminated his capacity to control his actions, he wouldn’t escape the liability. The medical experts stated that Mr. Randall had no control of his actions, however, according to the Court, they meant no ‘rational’ control not physical. Therefore, since acting irrationally cannot prevent a person liability in negligence and since Mr. Randall was ‘merely impaired’ by his medical condition and his mind, however unwell, still directed his actions, the defendant was liable to Mr. Dunnage in negligence.
