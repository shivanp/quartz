# Dennis v Ministry of Defence [2003] EWHC 793 (QB)

The claimants owned a large property about two miles from a RAF training base. The court found the activities of the RAF amounted to a nuisance; flying approximately 70 Harrier jump jets per day, causing a considerable amount of noise.

The claimants were awarded damages in lieu of an injunction. Public benefit (defence of the nation) outweighed the claimants’ rights. The claimants were awarded £950,000, which was the amount by which the value of their home had been depreciated by the aircraft noise.
