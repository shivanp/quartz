# Lambert v Barratt Homes Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 681

## Summary

It was not fair, just or reasonable to impose on a local authority a duty to carry out and pay for relief work to an existing drainage system which had been blocked by a developer and caused water to accumulate on the local authority's land and subsequently damaged nearby properties.

## Abstract

The appellant local authority appealed against a decision ([_[2009] EWHC 744 (QB), [2009] 32 E.G. 70](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0B181B40233D11DEB0B0BB67A20EB8A8/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e33249c43d2849b592eaedd195cb382b&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_) that it was liable in relation to damage to properties occupied by the respondents (L).

L's properties were situated near land which had been owned by the local authority. The local authority sold part of the land to a developer (B) and retained the remaining part. B developed the land but in doing so blocked a drainage ditch and culvert on its land. As a result, surface water from the local authority's land accumulated in a corner of that retained land and on occasions flooded into L's properties and caused damage. It was later decided that to prevent flooding, a catch pit should be constructed on the local authority's land and drainage should be laid. L commenced proceedings against B and the local authority. It was found that B was primarily responsible, but the local authority was found to have breached its measured duty of care in failing to abate the nuisance, in failing actively to co-operate in solving the problem and in failing to construct the necessary drainage ditches and catch pit.

The local authority submitted that the judge had failed properly to address the scope of any measured duty of care which it had.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

The judge found by inference that the scope of the local authority's duty extended to carrying out and paying for the relief scheme, or substantial parts of it. A measured duty of care in nuisance or negligence was a duty which was owed by one occupier of land to another. It was therefore necessary to consider what steps it was reasonable to expect the person on whose land the hazard had arisen to take to prevent damage to other land liable to be affected by it. Any such duty to act arose as soon as the landowner became, or should have become, aware that the hazard had come into existence.

In the instant case, when it became apparent that the flooding of L's properties was likely to be a regular occurrence, the fact that the hazard was, and was known to have been, created by B having blocked the ditch on land which it then occupied was one of the factors to be taken into account in deciding the scope of the local authority's duty, but unless it was also clear that L had a good cause of action against B to recover the cost of any relief works, it was not possible to take that fact into account as being established when assessing the scope of the local authority's duty at that time. The scope of the duty of care depended on the particular circumstances of the case, _[Goldman v Hargrave [1967] 1 A.C. 645, [1966] 6 WLUK 31](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB244ED10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e33249c43d2849b592eaedd195cb382b&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ and _[Leakey v National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty [1980] Q.B. 485, [1979] 7 WLUK 277](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF57C660E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e33249c43d2849b592eaedd195cb382b&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ considered.

The local authority was not at all responsible for the cause of the flooding but as a result of B's actions the only way of removing the hazard which resulted from the natural accumulation of rainwater on part of its retained land was to carry out work, the cost of which was likely to be considerable, _[Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callagan (Trustees for St Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions) [1940] A.C. 880, [1940] 6 WLUK 40](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9FDFCCC1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e33249c43d2849b592eaedd195cb382b&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ distinguished. Given the nature of the retained land, the local authority could reasonably have been expected to allow L access to it free of charge to enable the catch pit to be constructed, and could also have been expected to provide reasonable assistance in providing, or assisting L to obtain, any consents necessary to enable the drainage to be laid. While the nuisance continued it was under a continuing duty of care.

By the time the judge had to decide on the scope of the local authority's duty he was also in a position to determine that B was liable to L in respect of the nuisance. The fact that L had a right to recover from B the whole of the cost of the work was a powerful factor to take into account when determining the current scope of the local authority's duty of care. It was therefore not fair, just or reasonable to impose on the local authority a duty to carry out and pay for any part of the necessary relief works. It was under a duty to cooperate in a solution which involved the construction of suitable drainage and a catch pit on its retained land but that did not extend to obliging it to meet the whole cost of the relief works.
