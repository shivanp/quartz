# Lagden v O'Connor [2004] 1 AC 1067

The claimant hired a vehicle on credit while waiting for the defendant's insurers to repair his car – 'on credit' meaning he did not have enough to pay the hire charges, so he agreed to pay them later, and this made the overall charges significantly greater.

**Held:** it was reasonably foreseeable that the claimant would have to borrow money or incur some other kind of expenditure to mitigate his damages, and therefore the defendant was liable for the full extent of the claimant's economic loss, even though he had suffered to a greater extent because of his impecuniosity. The court reached this rule by applying the 'thin skull' rule – the defendant needs to take the claimant 'as he finds him'.
