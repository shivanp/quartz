# Nichols v Marsland (1876) 77 LR 2 ExD 1

The defendant’s artificial pools flooded and damaged the claimant’s property. The flooding was caused by a very unusual amount of rainfall which was wholly unexpected, so the defendant had a complete defence.

---

The defendant had pools on his land formed by damming a natural stream which flowed through his property. Due to extraordinarily high rainfall, the banks broke and four of the claimant’s bridges were swept away. The defendant was not liable for such an extraordinary act of nature, which could not have been foreseen.
