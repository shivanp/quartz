# Walker v Northumberland County Council [1995] 1 All E.R. 737

#key-case

## Facts

The claimant social services' manager had a heavy and emotionally demanding caseload. He suffered a nervous breakdown due to pressure at work and was promised additional support, which was not delivered. He went on to suffer a second breakdown.

## Held

An employer owes their employees a duty of care in respect of psychiatric harm caused by stress at work. There was no breach in relation to the first nervous breakdown as this was unforeseeable. However, there was a breach in relation to the second, given this was reasonably foreseeable as the claimant's workload was not reduced. As there was a sizeable risk that the claimant would suffer a second nervous breakdown and the likely gravity of that illness, the defendant should have taken measures to ensure the workload was permanently reduced.
