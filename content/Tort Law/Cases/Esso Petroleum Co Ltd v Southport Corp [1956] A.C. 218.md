# Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Southport Corp [1956] A.C. 218

The captain of the defendant’s oil tanker, discharged 400 tons of oil into the sea, causing damage to a Marine Lake owned by the claimant.

The **defence of necessity was successful**; the captain had **acted in an emergency** to prevent death or serious injury. Had he not discharged the oil, the tanker would have sunk, putting the lives of the crew at stake. The **defendant’s negligence had not caused this emergency**, and the captain therefore acted reasonably.
