# Orchard v Lee [2009] EWCA Civ 295

## Facts

The claimant was a school dinner lady acting as a supervisor in a childrenâ€™s playground. She sustained injuries when a 13-year-old boy ran backwards into her while playing a game of tag. She sued the boy in the tort of negligence,

## Issue

Establishing negligence involves showing that the defendant owed the claimant a duty of care, which they breached in a manner that caused the claimant recoverable harm. It was not disputed that the boy owed the supervisor a duty. However, to establish a breach, the claimant must establish that the defendant failed to act as a reasonable person would in their position.

The issue was whether the boy had breached his duty of care, and the relevance of his age.

## Decision/Outcome

The Court of Appeal held that the boy had not breached his duty of care, and so was not liable.

## Summary

A 13-year-old schoolboy was not liable for personal injury caused to a lunchtime supervisor when he collided with her whilst playing a game of tag in an outdoor area. The schoolboy's conduct was simply the conduct to be expected of a 13-year-old boy, and therefore did not amount to conduct in which he would reasonably foresee that there was likely to be injury beyond that normally occurring.

## Abstract

The appellant (O) appealed against a decision of the county court to dismiss her claim for personal injury against the respondent schoolboy (L).

L was 13 years old. He was playing tag in the courtyard and part of a walkway that was the designated social area at his school. While he was running backwards he collided with O, who was the lunchtime supervisor, causing her serious injuries. There was no rule against running in the area where the incident occurred. The court held that the incident was a simple accident caused by horseplay. It stated that no ordinarily prudent and reasonable 13-year-old boy would reasonably have foreseen the risk of injury by virtue of the game of tag in question.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

L's conduct was simply the conduct to be expected of a 13-year-old boy playing tag. No part of his conduct was outside the norm, let alone a significant degree outside it, nor was he breaking any rules. Therefore, his conduct could not be described as being careless to a very high degree, and it was clear that he was not culpable, _[Mullin v Richards [1998] 1 W.L.R. 1304, [1997] 11 WLUK 80](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I093899A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c528083b97de499cb6847ac603d2feb6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Blake v Galloway [2004] EWCA Civ 814, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 2844, [2004] 6 WLUK 506](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I75AE36E0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c528083b97de499cb6847ac603d2feb6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied, _[McHale v Watson 115 C.L.R. 199, [1965] 1 WLUK 17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0B1371B0E4B811DAB61499BEED25CD3B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c528083b97de499cb6847ac603d2feb6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. Further, a reasonable 13-year-old boy would not have anticipated that there was a sufficient probability that the harm actually caused would have resulted, _[Bolton v Stone [1951] A.C. 850, [1951] 5 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7666FF90E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c528083b97de499cb6847ac603d2feb6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered.
