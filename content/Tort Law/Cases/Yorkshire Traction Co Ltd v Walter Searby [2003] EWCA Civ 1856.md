# Yorkshire Traction Co Ltd v Walter Searby [2003] EWCA Civ 1856

The claimant bus driver was stabbed by a passenger and claimed that the bus company negligently failed to use protective screens between drivers and passengers. The defendant bus company argued that they had introduced the screens on some buses, but that drivers had objected to them because the screens reflected light at night and were therefore dangerous. It was also argued that the risk of assault in the area from passengers was very low. The court held that, balancing these factors against each other, the bus company was not negligent in failing to put up the screens in all buses.
