# Stannard v Gore [2012] EWCA Civ 1248

The defendant stored tyres on his property. The tyres caught fire and the fire spread onto the claimant’s property. The claim failed because it was the fire that escaped, not the tyres (and the fire was not the ‘thing’ brought onto the defendant’s land). However, if the fire was deliberately started by the defendant, it could be argued that the fire _was_ the ‘thing’ brought onto the land.
