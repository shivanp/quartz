# Rylands v Fletcher (1868) LR 3 HL 330

The defendant engaged some independent contractors to construct a reservoir on his land in order to supply water for his mill. The builders failed to block off a number of disused mineshafts and, as a result, when the reservoir was filled, water escaped and flooded the claimant’s adjoining mine. The claimant commenced an action to recover the cost of the flood damage. There was no evidence of negligence by the defendant (as he had not known of the mineshafts).

## Summary

A person who, for his own purposes, brought on his land and collected and kept there anything likely to do mischief if it escaped, had to keep it in at his peril; and if he did not do so, he was prima facie answerable for all the damage which was the natural consequence of its escape. This case is the basis for the term “rule in Rylands v Fletcher”.

## Abstract

The appellants (R) appealed against a decision that they were liable in damages to the respondent (F) for an escape of water from their reservoir into F's coal mines.

R, to serve his mill, had built a reservoir on land adjacent to F's mines. Underneath the reservoir there were disused mine shafts with which F's mine shafts came into contact. When the reservoir was filled or partly filled with water, its weight broke through the disused shafts and the water penetrated F's mine and caused damage, for which F claimed against R. The Court of Exchequer decided that there was no cause of action. The Court of Exchequer Chamber reversed that decision, holding that there was a cause of action and awarding F damages.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

R, as the owners or occupiers of the land on which the reservoir was built, might lawfully have used that land for any purpose for which it might in the ordinary course of the enjoyment of land be used; and if, in the natural user of that land, there had been any accumulation of water and if by the operation of nature that water had passed onto F's land, F could not have complained about it.

On the other hand, if R had desired to use the land for a non-natural purpose, for example by introducing water either above or below ground in quantities and in a manner not the result of any work or operation on or under the land, and if in consequence of their doing so, or of any imperfection in the mode of their doing so, the water came to escape onto F's land, then what R were doing they were doing at their own peril, and they were liable for any damage suffered by F.

Blackburn J. in the Court of Exchequer Chamber had correctly stated the law in saying that a person who, for his own purposes, brought on his land and collected and kept there anything likely to do mischief if it escaped, had to keep it in at his peril; and if he did not do so, he was prima facie answerable for all the damage which was the natural consequence of its escape.
