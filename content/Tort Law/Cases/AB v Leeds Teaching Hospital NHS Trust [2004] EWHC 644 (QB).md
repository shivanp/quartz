# AB v Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust [2004] EWHC 644 (QB)

## Summary

Doctors could owe a duty of care to parents after the death of a baby that extended to giving parents an explanation of the purpose of the post mortem and what it involved, including alerting them to the fact that organs might be retained.

## Abstract

A, the three lead claimants in a group action, claimed damages for psychiatric injury from L, a number of hospitals. A were the parents of children whose organs had been removed at post mortem, retained and disposed of by the hospitals without the knowledge or consent of A. A argued that

(1) in removing and retaining the organs, L had committed the tort of wrongful interference;  
(2) L had breached its duty of care to A to explain that organs would be removed during the post mortem examinations and possibly retained, and to comply with their wishes, and  
(3) the court had a duty to right wrongs and should use the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2b624fdb75bd46dc9227046ba3334dc0&contextData=(sc.Default)) and Art.9 to shape the law to provide a remedy for A.

Held, giving judgment for L in part, that

(1) there could be no action for wrongful interference with the body of the child. The issue was whether A had any possessory rights in the organs once the post mortem had been completed. The principle that part of a body might acquire the character of property which could be the subject of rights of possession was a part of English law, and the rule that there was no property in a corpse was subject to an exception where part of the body had been the subject of the application of skill such as dissection or preservation techniques, _[R. v Kelly (Anthony Noel) [1999] Q.B. 621, [1998] 5 WLUK 211](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I50E74710E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2b624fdb75bd46dc9227046ba3334dc0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. All the post mortems had been authorised, and when the organs had been removed they were lawfully in the possession of the pathologists and their removal had been lawful. Once the post mortems had been completed the pathologists became entitled to possess the organs until a better right was asserted, _Doodeward v Spence 6 C.L.R. 406_ applied, and A had no right to possession or to the burial of organs lawfully removed at the post mortems and retained;

(2) whether L owed to A a duty of care depended on whether or not a doctor and patient relationship had existed between the clinicians and A when consent to the post mortems was obtained. Once the doctor and patient relationship was established the clinician owed a duty of care when seeking consent for a post mortem. The duty extended to giving the parents an explanation of the purpose of the post mortem and what it involved, including alerting them to the fact that organs might be retained. The practice of not giving information to relatives about procedures involved in the post mortem which they might find upsetting had been a blanket practice carried out by virtually all clinicians. However, the practice of not warning parents that a post mortem might involve the removal and subsequent retention of an organ could not be justified as a practice to be adopted in all cases, _[Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 W.L.R. 582, [1957] 2 WLUK 94](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I765413D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2b624fdb75bd46dc9227046ba3334dc0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered;

(3) where a pathologist had lawfully acquired a child's organ in the context of a coroner's post mortem when neither removal nor retention was known to the parents, and thereafter, without recourse to the child's parents, had used the organ for a research project, such use would be unlawful under the [Human Tissue Act 1961](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6089C1C0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2b624fdb75bd46dc9227046ba3334dc0&contextData=(sc.Default)) without inquiries having been made of, or consent having been obtained from, the parents. However, though the use of the organ for research would be unlawful, there was no cause of action available to the parents under the 1961 Act. Even allowing for the court's duty to provide where it could a remedy for wrongs committed, it could not construct a cause of action where none existed. Two of the claims in negligence would be dismissed as the risk of psychiatric injury was not sufficiently probable to have been foreseen. The remaining claim would succeed and general damages would be awarded in the sum of GBP 2,750.
