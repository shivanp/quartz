# Jones v Boyce (1816) 1 Stark 493

The claimant was a passenger on the defendant's coach. When a horse started to run away with the carriage due to the defendant's negligence, the claimant reasonably believed that the coach was about to overturn and so jumped off and broke his leg.

There was no [[Contributory negligence]]. The claimant had acted reasonably in the situation. The defendant could not criticise the claimant's attempts to avoid the danger created by the defendant.
