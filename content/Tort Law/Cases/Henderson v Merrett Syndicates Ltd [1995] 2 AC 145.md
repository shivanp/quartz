# Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd [1995] 2 AC 145

The claimants' financial affairs were managed by the defendant. The House of Lords found that the defendant had assumed responsibility to perform professional services for the claimants (they had assumed responsibility for the claimants’ financial affairs) and there was no reason why they should not be liable for damages in respect of economic loss flowing from the negligent performance of those services. The court also found that the claimants had reasonably relied on the defendant’s advice. The defendant had effectively taken over the claimants’ financial arrangements; they had assumed responsibility for the correctness of their advice as they had special knowledge and expertise. The claimants relied on that expertise and the defendant knew the claimants would suffer a loss if they were negligent.
