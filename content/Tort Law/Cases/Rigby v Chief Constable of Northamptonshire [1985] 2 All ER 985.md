# Rigby v Chief Constable of Northamptonshire [1985] 2 All ER 985

The police were found liable to pay damages for negligence having fired a gas canister into the plaintiffs’ gunsmith’s hop premises in order to flush out a dangerous psychopath. There had been a real and substantial fire risk in firing the canister into the building and that risk was only acceptable if there was fire fighting equipment available to put the fire out at an early stage. No equipment had been present at the time and the fire had broken out and spread very quickly.  

Held: The defence of necessity might be available to police officers when looking at a claim for damage to property.

Operational v policy considerations. Policy issues are non-justiciable. Some judges not keen on this distinction: can be hard to draw the line.
