# ICI Ltd v Shatwell [1965] AC 656

## Abstract

Where two fellow-servants combine to disobey an order deliberately, though they know the risk involved, and are hurt, volenti non fit injuria is a complete defence for their employer in an action by either based on the employer's vicarious liability for the other's negligence or breach of statutory duty. The fact that the forbidden act was also a deliberate breach of a statute does not affect the application of volenti non fit injuria to an action against the employer or fellow-servant.

Per Lord Reid: _[Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] A.C. 663, [1953] 6 WLUK 118](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBE479D00E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3471c61fa08f411fb35d01a7e6e87794&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , though authoritative on questions of causation, decided nothing about the defence of volenti non fit injuria.

P sued his employer, Co. D, for damages for injuries sustained when P and a fellow-employee X, both qualified shot-firers, made a test of the electrical circuit for firing certain explosives without taking shelter. They agreed to do this though they knew the danger involved and knew that it was contrary to D's orders and to recent statutory regulations. D's defence was that X's negligence had not caused the injury and volenti non fit injuria.

Held, (Viscount Radcliffe dissenting), that there was a causal connection between X's negligence, for which D was vicariously liable, and P's injury, but (unanimously) that volenti non fit injuria was a complete defence.
