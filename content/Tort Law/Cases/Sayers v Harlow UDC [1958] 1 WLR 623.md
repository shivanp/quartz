# Sayers v Harlow UDC [1958] 1 WLR 623

The claimant got stuck in the defendant's toilet cubicle. She unsuccessfully attempted to escape through the gap between the door and ceiling and on her way down stood on the toilet roll holder. As a result, she fell and was injured. Her damages were **reduced by 25%** as she failed to take reasonable care by attempting to rely on the unstable toilet roll holder.
