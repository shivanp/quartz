# R v Rimmington [2005] UKHL 63

Rimmington sent racially offensive items to people across the country. These people were not a ‘class’ in the way required by public nuisance.

## Summary

The offence of public nuisance was clear, precise, adequately defined and based on a discernible rational principle, and was not therefore contrary to common law principles or incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1989 Sch.1 Part I Art.7.

## Abstract

The appellants (R and G) appealed against a decision ([2003] EWCA Crim 3450, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 2878) refusing their appeals against convictions of causing a public nuisance at common law. R had sent a large number of separate postal packages containing racist material to individual members of the public based on their perceived ethnicity. He had been charged on indictment of a single count of public nuisance, contrary to common law. G had posted an envelope containing salt to the address of a friend as a practical joke. The envelope did not reach G's friend, as at a post sorting office, some of the salt leaked onto a postal worker's hands. The postal worker raised the alarm, believing that the salt was anthrax. The sorting office was evacuated, the second delivery was cancelled, and the police were called.

R and G submitted that

(1) the conduct formerly chargeable as the crime of public nuisance had now become the subject of express statutory provision, that the offence should be charged under the appropriate statutory provision, and that the crime of public nuisance had therefore ceased to have any practical application or legal existence;

(2) the crime of causing a public nuisance, as currently interpreted and applied, lacked the certainty and predictability necessary to meet the requirements of the common law itself or the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.7](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, allowing the appeals, that

(1) the most typical and obvious causes of public nuisance were the subject of express statutory prohibition. Where Parliament had defined the ingredients of an offence, possible defences, a prescribed mode of trial and a maximum penalty, it was ordinarily proper that conduct falling within that definition be prosecuted under the statutory offence and not a common law offence for which the potential penalty was unlimited. Good practice and respect for the primacy of a statute required that conduct falling within the terms of a specific statutory provision should be prosecuted under that provision unless there was good reason for doing otherwise. Although cases of common law public nuisance were relatively rare, it was not open to the court to conclude that the common law crime of causing a public nuisance no longer existed.

(2) The guiding principles of common law, that no one should be punished under a law unless it was sufficiently clear and certain to enable him to know what conduct was forbidden before he did it, and that no one should be punished for any act that was not clearly and ascertainably punishable when the act was done, were entirely consistent with Art. 7, _[R. v Misra (Amit) [2004] EWCA Crim 2375, [2005] 1 Cr. App. R. 21, [2004] 10 WLUK 232](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5A690DF0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The offence of public nuisance as defined in, _[R. v Stephens (1865-66) L.R. 1 Q.B. 702, [1866] 6 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6ACE7130E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was clear, precise, adequately defined and based on a discernible rational principle, Stephens, _[Attorney General v PYA Quarries Ltd (No.1) [1957] 2 Q.B. 169, [1957] 3 WLUK 47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6976ECF0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[R. v Madden (Michael John) [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1379, [1975] 6 WLUK 113](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5682D310E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callagan (Trustees for St Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions) [1940] A.C. 880, [1940] 6 WLUK 40](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9FDFCCC1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.

In the instant case, R had not caused a common injury to a section of the public, so his conduct lacked the essential ingredient of common nuisance. To permit a conviction of causing a public nuisance to rest on an injury caused to separate individuals, rather than on an injury suffered to the community or a significant section of it as a whole, was to contradict the rationale of the offence, pervert its nature, and change the constituent elements of the offence to the detriment of the accused, _[R. v Norbury [1978] Crim. L.R. 435, [1978] 1 WLUK 490](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8F0E58E0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Johnson (Anthony Thomas) [1997] 1 W.L.R. 367, [1996] 5 WLUK 195](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I504A91E0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_ doubted. R's conviction was quashed.

A defendant was responsible for a nuisance which he knew, or ought to have known, would be the consequence of what he did or omitted to do, _[R. v Shorrock (Peter Coar) [1994] Q.B. 279, [1993] 2 WLUK 261](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I69ABEA30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=11e425e761bd4546a954e873c6fa6066&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. In G's case, it had not been proven that G knew or should reasonably have known that the salt would escape into the sorting office or in the course of the post. G's conviction was therefore quashed.
