# Pearson v Coleman Bros [1948] 2 KB 359

A child found herself in the animal enclosure at a circus where she was attacked by a lion. There were no signs indicating that this was a private area and she was therefore a visitor.

## Case Digest

A person who has two pieces of land and invites the public to come to one of them can, if he chooses, limit the invitation to that one, but, if the other is contiguous to that piece, and he does not indicate to his invitees that his invitation is confined to the one piece of land, he cannot be surprised if they treat his invitation as pertaining to both pieces.

If a landowner is minded to mark out part of his land as a prohibited area, he must indicate to his invitees by appropriate means that it is a prohibited area. Whether or not proper and sufficient steps have been taken to delimit the prohibited area must depend on the facts of individual cases.

The infant plaintiff, a girl aged seven years, paid 1s. for a seat at the defendants' travelling circus. The circus proper and the animals' quarters called the “zoo” occupied adjoining portions of a field. The plaintiff, desirous to relieve herself, there being no public lavatory, crawled through the canvas tent surrounding the circus into the zoo. There was an authorised entrance to the zoo, which was controlled by the defendants. The plaintiff then went round the tent but did not find a suitable place. Eventually, she found a secluded spot by crawling under a runway near a lion's cage, when a lion put his paws out and mauled her.

Held,  
(1) the mere fact that this was a dangerous animal would not throw on the defendants the burden of proving that they were not liable for the injury if the facts established that the plaintiff was a trespasser at the point in question;

(2) a person who, to visit the zoo, entered by some unauthorised entrance could not, in general, be regarded as an invitee or licensee; but

(3) on the special facts of the case, as the defendants had not provided a place where the plaintiff could relieve herself, having regard also to her need, her age and her fruitless circuit round the tent, she must be regarded as being rightfully near the lion's cage pursuant to the original invitation which must be taken as extending impliedly to that place, and, consequently, the defendants were liable, as keepers of a dangerous beast, for a breach of their duty to the plaintiff to keep that beast so confined as to be incapable of doing damage. Questionable whether the defendants would in the same circumstances have been liable to an adult plaintiff.
