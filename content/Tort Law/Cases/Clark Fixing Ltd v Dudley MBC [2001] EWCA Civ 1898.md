# Clark Fixing Ltd v Dudley MBC [2001] EWCA Civ 1898

## Summary

A local authority was liable in negligence for damage caused to premises adjoining an empty property which it had compulsorily acquired where the authority was aware that the property was not secure and had been prone to instances of fire-setting by trespassers in the past.

## Abstract

The local authority appealed against a decision that it was negligent for failing to prevent the spread of fire from premises which it owned to the premises of C and D. The premises all shared a timber roof by which the fire had spread. The property owned by the local authority had been empty and had been subject to previous acts of vandalism, including the starting of fires. The judge had found, inter alia, that where the wrongdoing of a third party started a fire on a party's property, that party could be liable for fire damage to a neighbour's property, where that party, having knowledge or means of knowledge that a third party had created or was creating the risk of fire, had failed to take reasonable action to prevent fire from damaging neighbouring properties. Further, in the instant case, the local authority had had knowledge or means of knowledge that third parties had created or were creating a risk of fire.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the local authority had had knowledge or the means of knowledge that third parties had been creating fires in the property, therefore the judge had been correct in her finding of liability, _[Maloco v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987] A.C. 241, [1987] 2 WLUK 73](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IED7C8870E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=96cff4d3cf044b4c8aafeffc2fae8271&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ applied.

Given such knowledge, the local authority should have carried out investigations into the presence of combustible materials within the property and removed all such materials that were easily removable. It was apparent that the risk of a fire spreading should have been obvious to any individual who was responsible for the carrying out of safety assessments, including the fire risks, for the building.
