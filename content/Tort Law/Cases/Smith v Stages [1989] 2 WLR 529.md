# Smith v Stages [1989] 2 WLR 529

Two employees were injured in a car crash. As they had been paid travel expenses, were paid for travelling time and were within working hours, the House of Lords held that they were acting in the course of employment. In determining whether an employee is acting within the course of employment when travelling on the highway, the material question is whether they are going about their employer's business at the material time.
