# Ricket v Metropolitan Railway (1867) LR 2 HL 175

Lord Cranworth considered the adverse effect of building railways on nearby businesses, and in particular the Pickled Egg public house:

> ‘The very existence of a railway must cause loss to many persons in its neighbourhood. Every inn or posting-house at which post horses were kept suffered, as is well known, grievous loss by the first establishment of a railroad in its neighbourhood; in fact, the business of such a house was often utterly destroyed. But it was never contended that this was an injury for which compensation should be demanded.’

and,

> ‘there is nothing in authority or logic to say that the letting value of the premises cannot be affected by an interference which makes it less convenient to conduct the kind of business for which they would otherwise have been suitable. A plaintiff who can prove such a reduction in value, for whatever period, is entitled to compensation.’  

Lord Cranworth
