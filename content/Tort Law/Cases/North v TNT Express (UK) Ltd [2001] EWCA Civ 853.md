# North v TNT Express (UK) Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 853

The claimant asked the defendant lorry driver for a lift home. The defendant refused, and the claimant climbed up on to the front bumper of the lorry. The defendant drove away slowly, worried the claimant would become violent. The claimant fell off, suffering injuries.

**The defence of necessity failed**; the defendant did not fear an imminent attack by the claimant or his friends. He was not acting to prevent death or serious injury.
