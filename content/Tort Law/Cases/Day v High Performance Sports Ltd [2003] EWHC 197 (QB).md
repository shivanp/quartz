# Day v High Performance Sports Ltd [2003] EWHC 197 (QB)

## Abstract

D brought an action for damages against H after she sustained a very serious brain injury in a fall from a climbing wall at H's sports centre. Although an experienced climber, she was found not to have attached a safety rope securely to her harness when she was 30 feet up the wall. D called for assistance but fell from the wall when S attempted to come to her aid.

Expert evidence showed that S's attempted rescue would not have succeeded, given the position he was in and the fact that D had frozen with her arms and legs spread out in a star shape on the face of the wall. D contended that H had been negligent in failing to assess the risk in advance in view of the foreseeability of such a problem occurring and that the rescue attempt was unreasonable or inappropriate.

Held, giving judgment for H, that S was the only person able to reach D at the time and his attempted rescue would not have succeeded in any event. The lack of a trained climber on the ground wearing a harness was not a factor in causation and the failure to provide such a person was an error of judgement not negligence on H's part, _[Horsley v MacLaren (The Ogopogo) [1971] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 410, [1971] 5 WLUK 17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC3A3F291E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=46463dd13d2643c1b7d1a122d1913130&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Eckersley v Binnie 18 Con.
