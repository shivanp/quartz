# Bailey v Armes (1999) EGCS 21

## Abstract

B, a minor aged eight years, sustained serious injuries after falling from a sloping flat roof. B had been encouraged to climb up on to the roof from the garden below by his friend W, the son of Mr and Mrs A. B commenced proceedings against Mr and Mrs A, who occupied a flat overlooking the roof, the building below which was in turn occupied by a supermarket. Mr and Mrs A permitted their own children to climb onto the roof to play; usually gaining access via a window from the flat. They did not permit other children to play on the roof at any time. B appealed against the first instance decision that neither Mr nor Mrs A were liable in negligence to B as occupiers under the [Occupiers Liability Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B605520E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9c6f729cb0ea4f5b9ef71e18bba63f3f&contextData=(sc.Search)) and the [Occupiers Liability Act 1984](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I601EF200E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9c6f729cb0ea4f5b9ef71e18bba63f3f&contextData=(sc.Search)) .

B contended that Mr and Mrs A exercised sufficient control over the roof to be regarded as occupiers because the roof could be accessed from the windows of their living accommodation and they permitted their own children to climb on it. B further contended that an additional duty of care over and above that imposed by statute could arise at common law, _[Revill v Newberry [1996] Q.B. 567, [1995] 11 WLUK 34](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I85E12301E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9c6f729cb0ea4f5b9ef71e18bba63f3f&contextData=(sc.Search))_ referred to.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) the extent of control was a question of fact and degree, _[Hartwell v Grayson, Rollo and Clover Docks [1947] K.B. 901, [1947] 4 WLUK 15](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBB20FE10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9c6f729cb0ea4f5b9ef71e18bba63f3f&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. It was clear that more than one person could exercise control over premises, but on the facts the judge was correct in his conclusion that neither Mr nor Mrs A had a sufficient degree of control to be deemed occupiers for the purposes of the 1957 Act, _[Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd [1966] A.C. 552, [1966] 2 WLUK 48](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF8B77B90E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9c6f729cb0ea4f5b9ef71e18bba63f3f&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered, and

(2) there was an insufficient degree of proximity between the defendants and plaintiff to give rise to any additional duty of care.
