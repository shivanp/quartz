# Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2003] 1 AC 32

Facts

The claimants were all employees who developed mesothelioma as a result of asbestos exposure. In each case, the claimant was negligently exposed to asbestos by multiple employers. At the time, doctors believed that any single fibre of asbestos (or a small number) could cause mesothelioma. For this reason, there was no way of proving which employers’ negligence was responsible for the claimants’ illnesses. This meant that the claimant could not prove that but for the negligence of any particular employer they would not have suffered their injury.

Issue(s)

   > Could the claimants prove that any particular employers’ negligence caused their injury?

Decision

The House of Lords held in favour of the claimants. Each employer had materially contributed to the risk of them contracting mesothelioma. This was enough to establish causation in this kind of case.  
This Case is Authority For…

Where the claimant suffers a disease whose onset cannot be attributed to any particular or cumulative negligent event, the court will apply a different test of causation. All the claimant must prove is that the defendant materially increased the risk of the claimant suffering the injury.
