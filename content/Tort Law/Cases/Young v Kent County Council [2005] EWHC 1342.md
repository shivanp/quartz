# Young v Kent County Council [2005] EWHC 1342

The defendant council were liable for the claimant’s injury as children climbing on a school roof was a known risk which they had failed to protect against, despite there being a low-cost solution (fencing it off). There had been a Health and Safety Executive report on the skylight that had indicated that it was brittle.

A 12-year old’s damages were reduced by 50% for contributory negligence. The claimant was jumping on, and fell through, a brittle skylight. Here the claimant was a trespasser, not a visitor.
