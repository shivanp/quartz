# Cullin v London Fire & Civil Defence Authority [1999] PIQRP 314

The claimant fire fighter suffered psychiatric injury after witnessing two colleagues trapped inside a burning building. In his rescue attempt, he was exposed to danger or reasonably believed he could be subjected to physical injury and was therefore a primary victim.
