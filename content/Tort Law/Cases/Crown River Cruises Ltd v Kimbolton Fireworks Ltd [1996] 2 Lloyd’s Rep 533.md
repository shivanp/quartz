# Crown River Cruises Ltd v Kimbolton Fireworks Ltd [1996] 2 Lloydâ€™s Rep 533

A fact-sensitive decision, where a firework display (and the resulting fire) was held (obiter) to be a private nuisance (the claim succeeded in negligence). The fire caused extensive property damage. The court suggested that where an activity creates a state of affairs which gives rise to the risk of escape of physically dangerous or damaging material, such as water, gas or fire, then private nuisance is available, even if the state of affairs is brief in duration.

The fireworks were on a floating barge on the river, which was permanently moored, but it was held that this could constitute land

## Abstract

C claimed in negligence, nuisance and under the rule in _[Rylands v Fletcher (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330, [1868] 7 WLUK 83](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I913A6901E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=cedd5e29e9ee4e54800db77d9223a442&contextData=(sc.Search))_ for damage caused to their floating barge and a passenger vessel moored alongside it following a firework display held by K on the River Thames. The fire authority had been called to a small fire on the barge caused by falling debris during the display and a second fire later damaged both the passenger vessel and the barge.

Held, giving judgment for C, that

(1) K had been negligent in putting on the firework display without first checking whether any flammable material was on board the vessels in the vicinity, and expert evidence had shown that the second fire occurred because of the fire authority's negligent failure to ensure that the first fire was properly extinguished;  
(2) the barge was permanently moored and C owned a licence which gave them exclusive use and occupation. This meant that, as the barge was attached to the land, an action in private nuisance against K was sustainable as the display interfered with C's use and enjoyment of the land and  
(3) there was a case for extending the rule in Rylands v Fletcher to accumulations in a vessel on a river and to intentional releases, as well as accidental escape, provided the release was not deliberately intended to be aimed at the plaintiff's property. However, a finding of liability under Rylands v Fletcher was not made against K in this case.
