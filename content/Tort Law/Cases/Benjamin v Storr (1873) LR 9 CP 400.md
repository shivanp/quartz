# Benjamin v Storr (1873) LR 9 CP 400

The claimant ran a coffee house in Covent Garden. The defendant auctioneers next door created a lot of obstruction and inconvenience to the claimant (constantly loading and unloading vans, which restricted access to the coffee house and made the coffee house uncomfortable). This interference was direct and substantial.
