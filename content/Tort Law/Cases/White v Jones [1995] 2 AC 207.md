# White v Jones [1995] 2 AC 207

Solicitors owed a duty of care to beneficiaries who should be allowed to sue the solicitor for the loss of an intended legacy. Two sisters were written out of their father's will following an argument. Later, the sisters made up with their father, and he instructed his solicitors to redraft his will, including an inheritance of Â£9,000 to each daughter. The alteration to his will was not made before he died. The solicitor could **foresee** that if the will were not drafted before the testator died, the intended beneficiaries would suffer a loss. The solicitor had undertaken a **responsibility** towards the beneficiaries.
