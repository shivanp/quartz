# Woods v Durable Suites Ltd [1953] 1 WLR 857

## Abstract

Per Singleton, L.J.:

> "I do not believe it to be part of the common law of England that an employer is bound, through his foreman, to stand over workmen of age and experience every moment they are working and every time that they cease work, in order to see that they do what they are supposed to do. That is not the measure of duty at common law. The duty is to take reasonable care and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk."

The plaintiff was employed by the defendants in their furniture factory, where he worked as a glue spreader. That work almost inevitably involved the workers' hands and arms coming into contact with synthetic glue, a substance known to be dangerous in that it was liable to cause dermatitis unless proper prophylactic precautions were taken. No statutory regulations had been issued in respect of the particular hazard, but circulars published by H.M. Stationery Office in 1943 and 1946 gave instructions as to the nature of dermatitis and precautions recommended against contracting the disease, and one of those circulars was prominently displayed near the plaintiff's place of work at the material time.

The plaintiff contracted dermatitis. He brought an action for damages against the defendants, alleging, inter alia, that they were guilty of negligence at common law. Lloyd-Jacob, J., after saying that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Clifford v Challen (Charles H.) & Son did not justify the proposition contended for by the plaintiff, namely, that the employers' duty required a foreman to be posted to prevent non-observance of the precautions and to ensure that the workmen made full use of the protective devices, gave judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed.

Held, on appeal, Clifford v Challen had not laid down a new standard; on the facts of the case negligence on the part of the defendants had not been proved; consequently, the appeal must be dismissed ( _[Clifford v Charles H Challen & Son Ltd [1951] 1 K.B. 495, [1950] 12 WLUK 7](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I88A28260E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aa73380e64714900bc2a066c588cf570&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished).
