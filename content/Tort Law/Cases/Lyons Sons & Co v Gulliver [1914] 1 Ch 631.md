# Lyons Sons & Co v Gulliver [1914] 1 Ch 631

The defendant caused a queue outside the claimant’s café twice a day. This was an inconvenience to the public (obstruction of the highway), and the claimant suffered special damage as his café trade was severely disrupted as a result (pure economic loss).
