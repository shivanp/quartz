# Titchener v British Railway Board [1983] 1 WLR 1427

A 15-year-old consented to the risk when she walked through a gap in the fence onto a live railway line.

She was a trespasser, not a visitor. The fences constructed by the railway company were sufficient warnings. Physical barriers can be enough to discourage trespassers from taking the risk.

## Abstract

The mere presence of a fence, despite gaps, may constitute sufficient warning of the presence of a railway line without the necessity for maintenance in good repair. D's railway line through suburban Glasgow was bordered by dilapidated fencing which had not been maintained for years and which contained numerous gaps. P, aged 15, was severely injured whilst crossing the line through one of the gaps. P admitted that she was fully aware of the line's existence, of the danger of going on it, and that she had kept a lookout for trains when going on the line previously. The line was on an embankment, and the dilapidated fence gave further warning of its presence. No criticism was made of the way the train was operated. P claimed against D for D's failure to maintain the fence in a reasonable state of repair. The Lord Ordinary and the Court of Session found for D. P appealed.

Held, dismissing the appeal,

(1) that the existence and extent of a railway operator's duty to fence depended upon the circumstances of the case, such as the age and intelligence of the particular person entering upon the premises, and the nature of the locus and the obviousness of the railway line. In this case the mere presence of the fence despite its gaps and the other circumstances constituted sufficient warning of the presence of the line without the necessity of maintaining it in good repair, and D had carried out its duty under the [Occupiers' Liability (Scotland) Act 1960 s.2(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I86C051E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=451619eeeebe46b2a04677ef505ef180&contextData=(sc.Search)) ;

(2) D had established a defence under s.2(3) by showing that P had willingly accepted the risks of walking on to the line (_[McGlone v British Railways Board 1966 S.C.
