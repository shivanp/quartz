# Roberts v Ramsbottom [1980] 1 WLR 823

## Facts

The defendant was driving in his car when he suddenly suffered a stroke. The defendant knew he did not feel well. He also had some awareness of what was happening. During this time, he had two collisions (though he had no recollection of this). The defendant nevertheless kept driving and ultimately crashed into the claimantâ€™s parked car. The claimant was injured and suffered property damage. They sued the defendant in negligence.

## Issue(s)

1. What standard of care should be imposed on a driver who suffers from a physical illness?

## Decision

The High Court held in favour of the claimant. The defendant had not completely lost control of his actions, which fell below the objective standard of care imposed on drivers. It did not matter that the defendant did not appreciate the significance of his symptoms (being unaware he was having a stroke).
