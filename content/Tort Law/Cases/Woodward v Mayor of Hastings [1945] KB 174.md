# Woodward v Mayor of Hastings [1945] KB 174

A pupil at the defendant's school fell and injured himself on an icy step. The step had been left in a dangerous condition by a cleaner.

There was no technical knowledge required to recognise that an icy step was dangerous and, therefore, the defendant was able to and should have checked and supervised the contractor in question.

By not checking the contractorâ€™s work, the occupier had not discharged their duty.
