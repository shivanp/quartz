# Coventry v Lawrence [2014] UKSC 13

The defendant’s speedway stadium causing the nuisance to the claimants had been built in 1975 with planning permission. However, it was in a very rural area, with the nearest village being 15 miles (ca. 24 km) from the claimants’ house. The Supreme Court effectively confirmed _Wheeler_; the planning permission did not authorise the nuisance. The noise from the stadium amounted to a nuisance, given that the area was overwhelmingly rural.

The court confirmed that planning permission does not determine private rights and therefore planning permission is normally of no assistance to the defendant in private nuisance claims. It would be wrong that through planning permission, a planning authority could deprive a property-owner of a right to object to what would otherwise be a nuisance. However, the court went on to say that there will be occasions when the precise terms of the planning permission may have a bearing on whether or not a nuisance exists (i.e., the terms can provide some evidence of un/reasonableness of the use of land), and it might also have relevance to remedies.

In **_Coventry_**, the stadium was constructed in 1975 and the claimant moved into the nearby house in 2006.

The defendant was unable to rely on the defence of prescription as it was not enough to show that the activity or noise had been carried on for 20 years. They had to establish that the activity had created a nuisance for 20 years or more, and they had not done this. The claimant’s predecessor only first formally complained of the defendant’s activities in 1992 (16 years before proceedings were brought by the claimant). Even then the predecessor was described by his wife as over-sensitive to noise and there was no real evidence that the noise had amounted to a nuisance during the 1990s. Note that the 20 years does not have to be continuous.

The claimants moved into a bungalow less than one kilometre from the defendant’s noisy motor-sports stadium and track. The claimants sued the occupier and landlord.

The landlord was not liable. A landlord could only be liable for their tenant’s nuisance if

1. they authorised it, by actively and directly participating in it, or
2. by leasing the property in circumstances where there was a very high degree of probability that leasing the land would result in that nuisance being created.

The nuisance (the noise) was not an inevitable or virtual certainty of renting the premises. It was not enough that the landlord knew how the tenants would use the premises; the premises could have been used in that way without creating the nuisance. The landlord had not participated in the nuisance. Whether a landlord has participated in a nuisance is a question of fact, mainly dependent on events taking place after the granting of the lease.

## Case Digest

### Summary

The Supreme Court set out the approach to be adopted when a court had to consider whether to award damages or grant an injunction in a nuisance case.

### Abstract

The appellants (L) appealed against a decision (_[[2012] EWCA Civ 26, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 2127](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFC1CFD2061A211E1A57DAED226AEA995/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a4a316261427458ab0a62407293d2339&contextData=(sc.Default))_) that activities on land close to their home did not constitute a nuisance.

The first respondent (C) was the operator of a stadium, constructed in 1976, where speedway and stock-car racing had taken place. The second respondent (M) operated a motocross track at the rear of the stadium. Planning permissions covering the speedway racing and motocross activities had been granted, while a certificate of lawful use covered the stock-car racing. In 2006, L moved into a bungalow located near the stadium. The judge at first instance upheld their claim that noise coming from the stadium and track amounted to a nuisance, but the judge's finding was reversed on appeal.

The instant appeal raised the following issues:

(i) the extent, if any, to which it was open to a defendant to argue that he had established a prescriptive right to commit what would otherwise be a nuisance by means of noise;  
(ii) the extent, if any, to which the defendant could rely on the fact that the claimant “came to the nuisance”;  
(iii) the extent, if any, to which it was open to the defendant to invoke the actual use of his premises when assessing the character of the locality;  
(iv) the extent, if any, to which the grant of planning permission for a particular use could affect whether that use was a nuisance;  
(v) the approach to be adopted by a court when deciding whether to grant an injunction to restrain a nuisance or whether to award damages instead.

### Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) In the light of the relevant principles, practical considerations and judicial dicta, it was possible to obtain by prescription a right to commit what would otherwise be a nuisance by noise (see para.[41](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of the judgment).

(2) It was no defence for a defendant sued in nuisance to argue that the claimant came to the nuisance, although it might well be a defence, at least in some circumstances, for a defendant to argue that, as it was only because the claimant had changed the use of, or built on, his land that the defendant's pre-existing activity was claimed to have become a nuisance, the claim should fail (para.[58](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) A defendant, faced with a contention that his activities gave rise to a nuisance, could rely on those activities as constituting part of the character of the locality, but only to the extent that they did not constitute a nuisance. Similarly, any other activity in the neighbourhood could properly be taken into account when assessing the character of the neighbourhood, to the extent that it did not give rise to an actionable nuisance or was otherwise unlawful (paras [74-75](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) The mere fact that the activity which was said to give rise to the nuisance had the benefit of a planning permission would normally be of no assistance to the defendant in a claim brought by a neighbour who argued that the activity caused a nuisance to his land in the form of noise or other loss of amenity. Among other things, it was wrong in principle that, through the grant of a planning permission, a planning authority should be able to deprive a property-owner of a right to object to what would otherwise be a nuisance, without providing him with compensation, when there was no provision in the planning legislation which suggested such a possibility (paras [90, 94](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(5) The court's power to award damages in lieu of an injunction involved a classic exercise of discretion, which should not, as a matter of principle, be fettered, although the prima facie position was that an injunction should be granted. As to the four tests set out _[Shelfer v City of London Electric Lighting Co (No.1) [1895] 1 Ch. 287, [1894] 12 WLUK 96](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA79278F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a4a316261427458ab0a62407293d2339&contextData=(sc.Default))_, their application should not be such as to fetter the exercise of the court's discretion. However, it would, in the absence of additional relevant circumstances pointing the other way, normally be right to refuse an injunction if those four tests were satisfied. But the fact that those tests were not all satisfied would not mean that an injunction should be granted, Shelfer considered. The public interest, if it arose, would be a relevant factor; for example, a court would be entitled to have regard to the fact that many other neighbours in addition to the claimant were badly affected by the nuisance as a factor in favour of granting an injunction. In some cases, the grant of planning permission for a particular activity might provide strong support for the contention that the activity was of benefit to the public, which would be relevant to the question of whether or not to grant an injunction (paras [120-121, 123-125](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(6) The application of the above principles justified the restoration of the injunction granted by the judge at first instance. Among other things, C and M had not shown that their activities during a period of 20 years amounted to a nuisance. To justify the establishment of a right to create a noise by prescription, it was not enough to show that the activity which now created the noise had been carried on for 20 years. It was not even enough to show that the activity had created a noise for 20 years. What had to be established was that the activity had created a nuisance over 20 years. However, under the “permission to apply” provision in the judge's order, C and M would be free to argue that the injunction should be discharged and damages awarded instead (paras [143, 148, 151](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
