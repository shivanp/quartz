# Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 QB 66

## Facts

Two claimants had been given an anaesthetic for minor operations. The anaesthetic had been contaminated with a sterilising fluid. This resulted in both claimants becoming permanently paralysed. The anaesthetic had become contaminated during storage. The anaesthetic was stored in glass ampoules which were emerged in the sterilising fluid. It transpired the ampoules had minute cracks which were not detectable with human eye. At the time it was not known that the anaesthetic could be contaminated in this way and the hospital followed a normal procedure in storing them this way.  

  

## Held

  

There was no breach of duty. The risk was not foreseeable as it was an unknown risk at the time.

### Abstract

Per Somervell, L.J.:

>"In medical cases the fact that something has gone wrong is very often not in itself any evidence of negligence."

Per Denning, L.J.:

>"I think the hospital authorities are responsible for the whole of their staff, not only for the nurses and doctors, but also for the anaesthetists and the surgeons. It does not matter whether they are permanent or temporary, resident or visiting, whole-time or part-time. The hospital authorities are responsible for all of them. The reason is because, even if they are not servants, they are the agents of the hospital to give the treatment. The only exception is the case of consultants or anaesthetists selected and employed by the patient himself."

>

>"If an injured person shows that one or other or both of two persons injured him, but cannot say which of them it was, then he is not defeated altogether. He can call on each of them for an explanation."

Per Morris, L.J.:

> "… the question as to what obligation a hospital has assumed becomes … ultimately a question of fact … : the ascertainment of the fact may require in some cases inference or deduction from proved or known facts."

The plaintiffs were admitted to hospital for minor operations. They both received, on the same day, spinal anaesthetics by injections of nupercaine and both developed spastic paraplegia. They claimed damages against the Minister of Health, as successor in title of the trustees of the hospital, and the anaesthetist. The nupercaine was stored in glass ampoules immersed in a solution of phenol, and the judge found that the injuries were caused by phenol, which could have entered the ampoules through flaws not detectable by visual examination, being injected with the nupercaine.

The plaintiffs contended that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied as against the hospital (on the basis that they were responsible for the actions of the anaesthetist) and as against the anaesthetist (because he administered the anaesthetic), inasmuch as the disastrous result in fact experienced did not ordinarily follow upon a spinal anaesthetic being properly administered.

Alternatively as against the hospital they alleged that (on the basis that the anaesthetist was in law the servant or agent of the hospital) the injuries were caused by the negligent injection of nupercaine contaminated by phenol, and that (on the basis that the anaesthetist was not in law the servant or agent of the hospital) the contamination occurred through the negligent mishandling of the ampoules by the theatre staff, and, further, that the failure to detect the contamination was due to failure to employ an effective system of differential colouring in the phenol in which the ampoules were stored.

It was further alleged as against the anaesthetist that he negligently injected the contents of an ampoule of nupercaine contaminated by phenol, that he failed to make any proper examination for cracks in the ampoules, and that he failed to adopt and maintain an effective system of differential colouring in the phenol in which the ampoules were stored.

Held, the anaesthetist, for whom the hospital authorities were responsible, was not negligent in relying upon visual inspection as a precaution against percolation from the ampoules and the nursing staff had no reason to foresee invisible cracks. _[Gold v Essex CC [1942] 2 K.B. 293, [1942] 7 WLUK 27](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB22C5C01E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a3bb69fd4e08482589a5885f387ab51e&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_; _[Cassidy v Ministry of Health [1951] 2 K.B. 343, [1951] 2 WLUK 58](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I83235800E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a3bb69fd4e08482589a5885f387ab51e&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_; _[Barkway v South Wales Transport Co Ltd [1950] A.C. 185, [1950] 2 WLUK 18](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6F713AC1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a3bb69fd4e08482589a5885f387ab51e&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ and _[Mahon v Osborne [1939] 2 K.B. 14, [1939] 2 WLUK 15](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IED1ED810E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a3bb69fd4e08482589a5885f387ab51e&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ applied.
