# Donoghue v Folkestone Properties Ltd [2003] QB 1008

The claimant suffered injuries when diving into the defendantâ€™s harbour. No duty was owed as although the defendant was aware people swam in the harbour during the summer, they were not aware that people would be swimming at night in midwinter.
