# Transco v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council [2003] UKHL 61

A pipe carrying water to flats owned by the defendant leaked and caused an embankment on the defendant’s land to collapse. This collapse exposed and left unsupported a gas pipe owned by Transco. Transco had to spend £94,000 to stop the pipe fracturing. The House of Lords held that the thing that escapes has to be reasonably recognised as having an exceptionally high risk of causing a danger if it were to escape. This sets a very high threshold and was not satisfied in Transco.

## Summary

The court reviewed the rule of law laid down in Rylands v Fletcher, finding that the piping of a water supply from the mains to storage tanks within a property was a routine function that would not ordinarily raise a hazard and was therefore an ordinary use of the land.

## Abstract

T appealed against a ruling ([2001] EWCA Civ 212, [2001] Env. L.R. 44) that the local authority was not liable for damage to T's property under the rule in _[Rylands v Fletcher (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330, [1868] 7 WLUK 83](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I913A6901E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c787cc8505834ad393c8dc910d10ef6d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ . Water had escaped from a pipe belonging to the local authority and supplying a block of flats of which it was the owner. There was no negligence on the part of the local authority. The water caused the collapse of a nearby railway embankment which left a gas pipe belonging to T unsupported and at risk of damage.

T claimed against the local authority the cost of remedial measures to protect the gas pipe, arguing that the local authority was liable for damage caused by the escape of the water without proof of negligence. The issues to be decided were whether the local authority had brought onto its land something likely to cause danger or mischief if it escaped, and that was an ordinary user of its land.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the test was whether the local authority had done something on its land which it

(1) recognised, or ought reasonably to have recognised judged by the standards appropriate to the place and time, as giving rise to an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if there should be an escape, and

(2) recognised, or ought to have recognised, as being quite out of the ordinary for the place and time. Piping of a water supply was a routine function which would not have struck anyone as raising any special hazard. The local authority had not accumulated any water but had merely arranged a supply adequate to meet the needs of the residents of the flats; the situation did not stand comparison with the substantial reservoir in Rylands v Fletcher . It was entirely normal and routine and could not be seen as in any way extraordinary or unusual, Rylands v Fletcher considered. The conditions to be met before strict liability could be imposed on the local authority were far from being met on the facts of this case.
