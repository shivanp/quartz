# Pollock v Cahill [2015] EWHC 2260 (QB)

The blind claimant visited his friend and fell out of an open window on the second floor, suffering serious injuries. The court held that the occupier must have regard to any known vulnerability. The fact the claimant was blind made the open window unsafe. The defendant should have warned the claimant or kept the window closed.

## Summary

A blind visitor's fall from an open bedroom window had been due to the occupiers' breach of their duty.

## Abstract

The claimant alleged that his fall from a bedroom window at the defendants' home, which left him a paraplegic, had been due to a breach of their duty as occupiers of the house.

The claimant was blind and had been a guest at the house. He was given a bedroom, but was not aware where the window was. When the claimant fell from the second-floor window, which had been left open, he sustained brain and spinal injuries which resulted in his being paralysed from the waist down.

The defendants argued that there were three possible explanations of how the claimant fell from the window: it was a complete accident; he had overbalanced after deliberately leaning out; or he had been sleep-walking and climbed out. The last two of those explanations did not involve any breach of duty on their part and the evidence was too unsatisfactory and too few facts were known for the court to exclude the last two possible explanations. They also argued that a fall through the window, while possible, had not been a real risk that would influence the mind of a reasonable man, and so they had taken such care as was reasonable in the circumstances to see that the claimant would be reasonably safe.

## Held

Judgment for claimant.

On the evidence, although she did not recall it, the second defendant had opened the window in the bedroom used by the claimant when she was making up the room. The defendants' two alternative explanations were not genuine possibilities: the claimant could not have leant out of the window as he did not know it was there or that it was open; and there was no evidence that he was prone to sleep-walking.

On a balance of probabilities, the claimant had fallen through the open window as he was trying to make his way to the bathroom after he had awoken, having lost his sense of direction. The common duty of care owed by occupiers pursuant to the [Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B605520E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9c01dffd20ac40ca9209d46c570deea9&contextData=(sc.Default)) required them to have regard to any known vulnerability of the visitor. An open window created an obvious risk for a blind person, particularly when it was on the second storey of the house with nothing to prevent a fall to the ground below. The evidence demonstrated that the risk had been apparent to the second defendant albeit that she clearly misjudged the extent of the risk.

The defendants had failed to discharge the common duty of care they owed as occupiers: the open window had been a real risk to the claimant; they created that risk; and they ought to have appreciated the risk and taken steps to prevent it by keeping the window closed or by warning the claimant about it with particular reference to the extent of the drop from the window (see paras [22-23, 45-46, 51, 53](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).
