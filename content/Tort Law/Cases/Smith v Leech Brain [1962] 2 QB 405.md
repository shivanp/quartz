# Smith v Leech Brain [1962] 2 QB 405

#key-case

The defendants negligently burned the claimant. The burn provoked the onset of a pre-existing malignant cancer from which the claimant subsequently died.

**Held:** if the defendant can foresee the original injury ie the type of harm (here, burns), they are responsible for anything that flows from that injury even if the claimant suffers to a greater extent because of a pre-existing condition. The defendant was liable for all physical damage to the claimant (the type of damage) and this included the cancer and death (the extent of the damage).
