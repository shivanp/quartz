# Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] AC 837

Workmen negligently left oil lamps surrounding a hole in the road. The claimant, aged 8, picked up one of the lamps and dropped it into the manhole, where it exploded, causing the claimant to fall into the manhole and suffer severe burns. The type of damage, being damaged from burns, was foreseeable â€“ for example, it was foreseeable that the claimant might knock over and break the lamp, causing a burn. However, the events as they unfolded were probably not foreseeable.

**HELD:** the harm was not too remote. As long as the type of damage is reasonably foreseeable, there is no need to foresee the exact way in which the burns occurred.
