# Davie v New Merton Board Mills Ltd [1959] A.C. 604

Although, if a master delegates to another person his duty to take reasonable care, he is vicariously liable for injury caused to his servant through the negligence of that person, that principle cannot be extended to a case where

- A master has ordered a standard tool from a reputable supplier, and
- Neither the master nor any of his agents or servants has been guilty of negligence, and
- The tool proves to be defective due to the negligence of the manufacturer.

In such a case, the master cannot be said to be in breach of his duty to take reasonable care to supply his workmen with proper tools. The plaintiff, a maintenance fitter, was knocking out a metal key be means of a drift and hammer when a particle of metal flew off the head of the drift and into his eye. The drift, which had been provided for the plaintiff's use by his employers, although apparently in good condition, was of excessive hardness, and was therefore dangerous; it had been negligently manufactured by reputable makers and obtained by the employers for damages for negligence.

Held, the employers, having exercised reasonable care in the purchase of the tool from reputable suppliers, were not liable to the planitiff. Per Lords Morton of Henryton and Tucker: The position would have been the same if the drift had been purchased direct from the manufacturers.
