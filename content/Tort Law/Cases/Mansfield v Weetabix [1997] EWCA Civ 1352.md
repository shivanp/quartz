The defendant drove his lorry into a shop owned by the claimant. At the time of the incident the defendant was had a malignant insulinoma which resulted in him being in a hyperglycaemic state although he was unaware of this. On the day of the crash he had also been involved in two minor incidents.  

  

Held:  

  

The defendant was not in breach of duty  

  

Leggatt LJ:

> "In my judgment the standard of care that Mr Tarleton was obliged to show in these circumstances was that which is to be expected of a reasonably competent driver unaware that he is or may be suffering from a condition that impairs his ability to drive. To apply an objective standard in a way that did not take account of Mr Tarletonâ€™s condition would be to impose strict liability. But that is not the law."
