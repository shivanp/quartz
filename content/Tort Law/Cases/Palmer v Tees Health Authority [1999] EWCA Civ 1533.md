# Palmer v Tees Health Authority [1999] EWCA Civ 1533

**Appeal** from the decision of Gage J. striking out the claims of the claimant as executrix of child R and on her own behalf.

_Health Authority—negligence—strike out—duty of care to deceased child—duty of care to mother—psychiatric illness—proximity_

On June 30, 1994 a man A abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered a child R. The claimant P, her mother, brought actions as executrix of R for the bereavement award and funeral expenses and on her own behalf for psychiatric illness allegedly arising from R going missing on June 30, 1994, subsequently being found dead at A's home on July 3, 1994 and being identified by her at the mortuary on July 6 or 7, 1994. P alleged that the defendant hospital trust responsible for the psychiatric care of A knew of his medical history and failed to diagnose a real, substantial and foreseeable risk of A committing serious sexual offences against children and as a consequence failed to treat him to reduce the risks of such offences and/or to detain him in hospital.

The defendants applied to strike out the claim as disclosing no cause of action. Gage J. struck out the claims. He concluded that there was no proximity between the defendants and R or the mother P in respect of her psychiatric injury and that it was not fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care upon the defendants.

Held, dismissing the appeal,

(1)  despite the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in _[Osman v. United Kingdom](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/I14AEDD80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bb60e1ec25a345e88b835c4685d2ec8d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , it was appropriate to strike out actions on the grounds that in law proximity was not established;

(2)  where there was no relationship between the defendant and the victim it was necessary for the victim to be identifiable to satisfy the test of foreseeability and the threshold requirement of proximity to establish a duty of care;

(3)  on the facts R did not pass the threshold requirement of proximity necessary to establish a duty of care and the claims of P as the executrix of R and of the mother P had been properly struck out;

(4)  there was not a sufficient proximity in time and space to R's death for the mother P to bring an action for consequent psychiatric illness.

On 20 June 1994 a man called A had abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered the claimant’s daughter, R. The claimant brought an action in negligence against the defendants. She alleged that A had come to the attention of various authorities and had been diagnosed as a very disturbed boy. Between 1992 and 1993 he had attempted suicide on five occasions and during his admission to hospital he had stated that he had sexual feelings towards children and that a child would be murdered after his discharge. She therefore claimed damages for the severe post-traumatic stress disorder and pathological grief reaction that she had suffered as a result of her daughter’s murder on the basis that the defendants and their predecessors, who were responsible for the administration and management of the hospital in which he had been treated, had failed to provide any adequate treatment for A to reduce the risk of him committing such offences.

The defendants applied to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. They contended that they owed no duty of care either to R or the claimant. The judge acceded to that submission, holding that there was no sufficient proximity between the defendants and R or the claimant, and that it was not fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty of care upon the defendants. The claimant appealed, submitting, inter alia, that on the question of proximity it was not necessary to have an identified or identifiable victim, but was sufficient that the injury of the type sustained was reasonably foreseeable.  

_Held_ – The appeal would be dismissed.  

Where there had been no assumption of responsibility to the victim, or any undertaking to treat or advise him, there could be no sufficient proximity such as would found a duty of care on the part of the defendant. Moreover, in a case such as the instant case, **it was at least necessary for the victim to be identifiable, though that might not always be sufficient, to establish proximity**, as the most effective way of providing protection would be to give warning to the victim, his or her parents or social services so that some protective measure could be made.

The ability to restrict and restrain a psychiatric patient was subject to considerable restriction under the Mental Health Act 1985. Furthermore, drug treatment, especially drug treatment of the patient, depended on his or her co-operation when an out-patient, and was limited when an in-patient. **Although it might be a somewhat novel approach to the question of proximity, it was a relevant consideration to ask what the defendants could have done to avoid the danger**, if suggested precautions, for example committal under s 3 of the 1985 Act or treatment, were likely to be of doubtful effectiveness, and the most effective precaution could not be taken because the defendants did not know who to warn.
