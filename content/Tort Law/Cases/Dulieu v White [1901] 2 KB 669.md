# Dulieu v White [1901] 2 KB 669

The claimant was a pregnant barmaid when the defendant negligently crashed his coach and horses through a wall in her pub. She suffered severe shock leading to her child being born with a cognitive impairment. She was a primary victim as she had reasonably feared for her own physical safety.
