# Tremain v Pike [1969] 1 WLR 1556

 The claimant contracted Weil’s disease whilst employed by the defendant farmer. He alleged that he became infected by having contact with rats’ urine. Incidence of the disease on the farm was very rare and there was no evidence that the farming community knew or ought to have known that such a disease existed or that a person might get this disease by handling matter contaminated by rats’ urine.

**Held:** injury from rat bites was foreseeable but not **injury contracted by contact with rat’s urine** (ie the courts defined the type of harm narrowly). Weil’s disease was a remote possibility which the defendant could not reasonably foresee.
