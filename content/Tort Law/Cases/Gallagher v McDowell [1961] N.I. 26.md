# Gallagher v McDowell [1961] N.I. 26

The doctrine in _[Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562, [1932] 5 WLUK 41](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I99FC57C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e8649c71d0794f748941bd396bb503c1&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ is capable of applying to defects in house property other than defects in respect of which landowners, when sued as such, are entitled to enjoy certain immunities.

Apart from contractual and statutory obligations an owner of a house who lets it unfurnished or sells it is under no duty to the tenant or purchaser, their families, invitees or licensees to take reasonable care that at the time of letting or sale the premises are fit for habitation and free from defects of a dangerous kind. The plaintiff, while walking over a floor in a house built by the defendants and of which her husband was the first tenant, was injured when the heel of her shoe went through the floor. Evidence was given that a plug of wood, which had been inserted in an unworkmanlike manner and without due care, gave way under the plaintiff's heel. In an action for negligence the trial judge withdrew the case from the jury on the ground that the defendants owed no duty in tort to the plaintiff and accordingly gave judgment for the defendants.

On appeal, held by the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland, reversing the decision of the trial judge,

(1) that there was evidence from which the jury, if they thought fit, could properly infer that the hole was made and plugged, or at any rate plugged by the defendants,  
(2) that the defendants were under a duty to the plaintiff, as a lawful user of the house they had constructed, to take reasonable care in the repair of the hole in the defective floor board, and  
(3) that the defendants could not reasonably have anticipated an examination which would have revealed the defect in the floor board. A new trial was accordingly ordered.
