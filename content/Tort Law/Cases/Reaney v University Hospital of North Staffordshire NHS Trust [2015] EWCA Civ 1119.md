# Reaney v University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust [2015] EWCA Civ 1119

## Summary

Where the care needs of a personal injury claimant were quantitatively, but not qualitatively, different from what would have been required but for the negligence of the defendant tortfeasor, the defendant was liable only for the additional needs. If the needs caused by the negligence were qualitatively different from the pre-existing needs, then those needs were caused in their entirety by the negligence.

## Abstract

The defendant NHS trusts appealed against a decision (_[[2014] EWHC 3016 (QB), [2015] P.I.Q.R. P4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I470723C0427311E490B1F97C5CF8C03F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7768964a459c4d6498145b9ef2a2272a&contextData=(sc.Search))_) that they were liable for all of the claimant's care needs.

The claimant at the age of 61 had contracted transverse myelitis which left her paralysed below the mid-thoracic level. As a T7 paraplegic her needs would have been met initially by the provision of a few hours care each week rising to 31.5 hours of care after the age of 75. With such care she could have led a largely independent life.

However, during her hospitalisation, she had developed a number of deep pressure sores with consequent osteomyelitis, hip dislocation, serious contractures of the lower limbs and increased lower limb spasticity. Her seating posture had been permanently damaged by the hip dislocation so that she was unable to use a standard wheelchair safely. She was also left with a large area of vulnerable skin where the pressure sores had healed. As a result she needed 24 hour care from two carers. The defendants admitted negligence in relation to the pressure sores. The judge held that the defendants were liable for all of the claimant's care needs resulting from the pressure sores and their consequences.

The defendants contended that they were liable for the claimant's care needs less the needs that she would have had but for the negligence.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

The judge should have held the defendants liable to meet the cost of the claimant's needs but only to the extent that her needs were increased as a result of the negligence, _[Performance Cars v Abraham [1962] 1 Q.B. 33, [1961] 7 WLUK 115](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1DE08890E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7768964a459c4d6498145b9ef2a2272a&contextData=(sc.Search))_, _[Baker v Willoughby [1970] A.C. 467, [1969] 11 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6DE91420E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7768964a459c4d6498145b9ef2a2272a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Halsey v Milton Keynes General NHS Trust [2004] EWCA Civ 576, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 3002, [2004] 5 WLUK 215](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB91B9120E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7768964a459c4d6498145b9ef2a2272a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed.

If the defendants' negligence caused her to have care and other needs which were substantially of the same kind as her pre-existing needs, then the damage caused by the negligence was only the additional needs. If the needs caused by the negligence were qualitatively different from her pre-existing needs, then those needs were caused in their entirety by the negligence. The judge's findings did not support a conclusion that the significant care package required as a result of the negligence was qualitatively different from what would have been required but for the negligence. His decision that all of her care and physiotherapy needs were caused by the defendants' negligence could not stand (see paras [15-26](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

The judge had erred to the extent that he had relied on the decision in _[Sklair v Haycock [2009] EWHC 3328 (QB), [2009] 12 WLUK 509](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I53C69BC0EB8B11DE81468E86CE8AF679/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7768964a459c4d6498145b9ef2a2272a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ in reaching his decision on causation: the judge in Sklair had confused the question of the need for care, which was a question of causation, with the question of who would have to pay for it; however, the decision in Sklair could be explained and supported on the basis that the care required as a result of the accident in that case was qualitatively different from that which would have been required but for the accident, Sklair explained (paras [30-33](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). There was no doubt about the claimant's condition before the negligence or about the injuries she suffered as a result of the negligence. It was therefore not necessary to modify the "but for" test and consider whether the negligence had made a "material contribution" to the claimant's condition, _[Bailey v Ministry of Defence [2008] EWCA Civ 883, [2009] 1 W.L.R. 1052, [2008] 7 WLUK 880](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE78720B05DFB11DD9CD4EDAFBE298ECC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7768964a459c4d6498145b9ef2a2272a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered (paras [34-36](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
