# Robert Addie & Son (Collieries) Ltd v Dumbreck [1929] AC 358

The respondent was the father of a four-year-old boy who was killed when he was crushed in the wheel of a haulage system belonging to the appellant colliery company. The field in which the wheel was situated was surrounded by a hedge, but it was well known that children would enter the field to use it as a play area. The colliery company were aware of this fact and warned children out of the area from time to time, but their warnings were disregarded. The wheel itself was inadequately protected and was attractive to children. The boy was regarded as a trespasser and as such his father had no remedy in law for his loss.

Even though the definition of trespasser remains unchanged, the law has moved on since this case was decided. Under the OLA 1984, a similar situation decided today would probably have afforded the boy some protection.
