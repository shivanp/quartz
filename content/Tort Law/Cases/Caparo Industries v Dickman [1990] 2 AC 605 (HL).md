# Caparo Industries v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 (HL)

## Facts in Caparo

A firm of accountants appealed against a decision of the [[Court of Appeal]] in which it was decided that the accountants owed a duty of care to the appellant shareholders when producing an audit report required by statute. The claim was for negligent misstatement. Caparo had bought shares in the company of which the report was about as part of a takeover. The appellant had relied upon the results of the report. However, it was later found that the results of the report had misrepresented the profits of the firm, in turn causing a loss for Caparo[9].

## Decision in Caparo

The House of Lords reversed the decision of the COA and held that no duty of care had arisen in relation to existing or potential shareholders. The only duty of care the auditor\`s owed was to the governance of the firm. It was found that three factors had to exist for there to be a duty of care which where: Proximity, Knowledge of who the report would have been communicated to and for what purposes it would have been used. Lord Bridge commented that cases where duty of care did arise[10] was illustrated in [Smith v Eric S Bush](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/smith-v-eric-bush.php).[11] The case holds the principle that it is reasonable to impose a duty of care for valuers of a property to those those purchasing a family home as this was commonplace. Finally, there had to be knowledge that the shareholders or investors would rely on the report in regards to the transaction. Furthermore, the judges noted that audit reports of plc\`s are regularly carried out which differs from reports carried out for specific purposes and for an identified audience. Thus, the accountants owed no duty to the entire public who might or might not place reliance on the report when making financial decisions. Moreover, appointing liability would open the floodgates to society as [JEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks Bloom & Co](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/jeb-fasteners-v-marks-bloom.php)[12] distinguished. Thusly, limitations have to be set when [[Pure economic loss]] occurs in the absence of contractual agreements between parties. It is also noted that the judgement accepts that there are circumstances where an auditor will owe a duty of care in respect of reports produced. These are conditional that at the time the report is prepared that is known by the auditors that the results are for a specific class for a specific purpose[13]. This is acknowledged in [Morgan Crucible v Hill Samuel](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/morgan-crucible-v-hill-samuel.php)[14] and [Law Society v KPMG](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/law-society-v-kpmg.php) Peat Marwick[15].

The defendants were auditors of a public company (Fidelity) who had prepared inaccurate reports for Fidelity’s annual accounts. The claimants bought shares in Fidelity based on this audit and made a successful takeover bid resulting in pure economic loss. The issue was whether the auditors owed a duty of care to the shareholders of Fidelity and/or the potential investors.

The House of Lords held that no duty was owed by the defendants to the claimants in their capacity as investors. The defendants did not owe a duty to the members of the public who had decided to invest or to the existing shareholders who relied on them to increase their shareholding. The main reason for this decision was that it was not reasonable for Caparo to have relied on the accounts for the purpose to invest. The purpose of the audit was to assist the shareholders in exercising their rights of control over the company; the information within the audit was not for potential investors. If a duty was owed to potential investors this would include a class of persons of an indeterminate size.

Caparo could therefore rely on the accounts in their capacity as a shareholder to exercise their rights of control, but not as an investor or as a shareholder increasing their shareholding. The accounts had the potential of being relied upon by anyone for any purpose and the auditors could not owe a duty to everyone who relied on them. The provision of information for one purpose should not be reasonably relied on for another, especially as there is no assumption of responsibility in respect of the alternative purpose.

This was a third-party case in that the advice was prepared for one company, Fidelity, but relied on by another, Caparo (the third party) – so Caparo were not the company to whom the advice was given or intended. However, this does not mean that the same principles are not applicable when ascertaining whether there is an assumption of responsibility between two parties.
