# Farrer v Nelson (1885) 15 QBD 258

The defendant owned hundreds of pheasants. The pheasants were able to access the claimant’s farm causing damage to his grain and other crops.

The plaintiff was tenant of a farm over which the defendants’ predecessor had reserved shooting rights. The defendants had brought pheasants in coops on to land very close to the plaintiffs’ farm. The came onto the farm damaging his crops. The defendant said that having a right of shooting over the land, it was necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of this right that they should be at liberty to stock the land with pheasants.  

Held: Pollock B said that so long as the lessee of the right of shooting was exercising the ordinary rights which the landlord who had reserved the right might have exercised, he was acting within his rights, but the moment he brings on game to an unreasonable amount or causes it to increase to an unreasonable extent, he is doing that which is unlawful, and an action may be maintained by his neighbour for the damage which he has sustained.
