# McKinnon Industries v Walker [1951] 3 DLR 577

The claimant had a commercial florist and nursery. Part of the claimant’s business involved growing orchids, known for their sensitivity. The claimant sued the defendant in private nuisance as the defendant’s factory was emitting fumes and smuts which deposited over his shrubs, trees, hedges, and flowers causing them to die. The court found the defendant's use of land to be unreasonable, and the claimant was entitled to recover for his property damage, including for his orchids despite their sensitivity. Given that ordinary flowers were affected by the defendant’s activity, the claimant could claim for the damage to the sensitive orchids. The claimant recovered costs for replacing the orchids and for lost profits on the damaged orchids.
