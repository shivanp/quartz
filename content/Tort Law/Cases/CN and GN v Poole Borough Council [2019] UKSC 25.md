# CN and GN v Poole Borough Council [2019] UKSC 25

## Facts

The Claimants, CN and GN, had been placed by the Council in a house on an estate in Poole with their mother in May 2006. CN was aged 9 and GN was aged 7. CN has severe mental and physical disabilities.

The family living in the neighbouring property were known by the Council to have engaged in anti-social behaviour persistently. Soon after their arrival, this family began a campaign of harassment and abuse against GN, CN and their mother which lasted for several years. This included vandalism, attacks on the family home, threats of violence, verbal abuse, and physical assaults. All measures, including eviction, anti-social behaviour orders, of sentences of imprisonment, etc. had failed to stop the abuse. Even a Home Office-commissioned independent report criticised the police and of the council’s failure to make adequate use of powers available under anti-social behaviour legislation.

GN expressed suicidal thoughts and ran away from home, aged 10, in September 2009, leaving a suicide note. Eventually the family were moved in December 2011.

CN and GN brought a claim for personal injuries caused by the campaign of abuse, but it was struck out. They appealed that strike out decision up to the Supreme Court. The case therefore did not reach the stage of going to a full hearing.

**Basis of the claim**

The Claimants made 2 broad claims:

- The Council had a duty, at common law, to duty to protect children in its area, and in particular children reported to it as being at foreseeable risk of harm. The Council breached this duty by failing to properly investigate the Claimants’ situation. Had a proper investigation taken place, the Claimants would have been removed from their home.
- The Council was vicariously liability for the failures by its employees, the social workers, to meet their duty of care. That duty of care included duties to protect the Claimants, monitor them, and ultimately remove them from the risk of harm.

**Decision of the Court of Appeal**

The Court of Appeal, whose decision is covered [here](https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2018/02/19/where-are-we-now-on-social-services-liability/), had rejected the claim for two main reasons. First, they found that imposing liability in negligence in a difficult and sensitive field, such as social work, could lead to defensive decision making in these areas which would be contrary to public policy. They relied on two previous cases, one involving social services and one involving the police, which had reached similar conclusions.

They also relied on the principle that, generally, a legal person (i.e the local authority) is not liable for the wrongdoing of a third party (in this case, the abusive neighbours), even where that wrongdoing is foreseeable.

The Claimants appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.

**Decision of the Supreme Court**

The Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the claim should be struck out, but for different reasons from the Court of Appeal.

> the council’s investigating and monitoring the claimants’ position did not involve the provision of a service to them on which they or their mother could be expected to rely … Nor could it be said that the claimants and their mother had entrusted their safety to the council, or that the council had accepted that responsibility. Nor had the council taken the claimants into its care, and thereby assumed responsibility for their welfare.  
> (Lord Reed)

Whilst a loss for CN and GN, the decision is likely to be considered a victory for claimants generally, as the Court has explicitly overruled _X (Minors) v Bedfordshire_ and found that, in some circumstances, a local authority can be liable to children if it fails to protect them from third parties.

### Summary

The Supreme Court summarised the circumstances when a local authority could be said to have a duty of care when exercising statutory functions. A local authority which had exercised functions under the [Children Act 1989 s.17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB817D260E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default)) and [s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB87F1FB0E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default)) had not had a duty of care towards the children concerned as it had not assumed responsibility for their safety or welfare.

### Abstract

Two children appealed against a decision that a local authority was not liable for failing to protect them from harm caused by third parties.

In 2006, the local authority had housed the children and their mother next door to a family known for anti-social behaviour. One of the children was disabled. For several years the children and their mother suffered abuse and harassment at the hands of their neighbours who verbally abused them, attacked their home and car, physically assaulted the mother and one of the children, and made threats of violence. Various measures taken by the local authority to halt it were unsuccessful. One of the children became suicidal and ran away from home. The children were assessed as children in need under the [Children Act 1989](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FF1A070E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default)). The local authority undertook an investigation relating to one of the children under [s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB87F1FB0E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default)) and he was made subject to a child protection plan. The children and their mother were eventually rehoused by the local authority in 2011. They claimed that the abuse had caused them physical and psychological harm and that the local authority owed them a duty of care at common law when exercising its functions under [s.17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB817D260E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default)) and s.47.

### Held

Appeal dismissed.

Whether a public authority owed a duty of care - general principles

- Public authorities might owe a duty of care in circumstances where the principles applicable to private individuals would impose such a duty, unless a duty would be inconsistent with, and was therefore excluded by, the legislation from which their powers or duties were derived.
	
- Public authorities did not owe a duty of care at common law merely because they had statutory powers or duties, even if, by exercising their statutory functions, they could prevent a person from suffering harm.
	
- Public authorities could come under a common law duty to protect from harm in circumstances where the principles applicable to private individuals or bodies would impose such a duty, for example where the authority had created the source of danger or had assumed a responsibility to protect the claimant from harm, unless the imposition of such a duty would be inconsistent with the relevant legislation, _[Stovin v Wise [1996] A.C. 923, [1996] 7 WLUK 392](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBFDB8370E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Gorringe v Calderdale MBC [2004] UKHL 15, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 1057, [2004] 4 WLUK 58](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB2C20C51E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] UKHL 11, [2009] 1 A.C. 874, [2009] 2 WLUK 483](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0AADDED0FE3D11DD9FBFF352A9E9B22D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default))_; _[Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales [2015] UKSC 2, [2015] A.C. 1732, [2015] 1 WLUK 622](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8376AC00A71211E48D9BFE15FEBA9566/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default))_; and _[Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [2018] UKSC 4, [2018] A.C. 736, [2018] 2 WLUK 189](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I597834D00CC911E886A2D99321F34449/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed.

Whether a local authority or its employees owed a duty of care to a child depended on the application of the general principles above, most recently clarified in Robinson, X (Minors) superseded in part, Robinson followed and _[JD v East Berkshire Community Health NHS Trust [2003] EWCA Civ 1151, [2004] Q.B. 558, [2003] 7 WLUK 970](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICCB9D841E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied (see paras [65, 70-74](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

Did the local authority owe a duty of care in relation to the performance of its functions under the 1989 Act?

The local authority was alleged to have failed to provide a benefit to the children (by protecting them from harm) rather than to have harmed them directly. The claim was based on an assumption of responsibility or "special relationship" created by the local authority's investigation, by the assignment of social workers to the children, and by the various assessments of their needs. However, the local authority had not assumed responsibility because:

- Its investigation and monitoring of the children's position did not involve the provision of a service on which they or their mother could be expected to rely.
- The children and their mother had not entrusted their safety to the local authority, and the local authority had not accepted responsibility for it.
- The local authority had not taken the children into care and thereby assumed responsibility for their welfare (nor were there any grounds to remove them into temporary care because the harm was not attributable to a lack of reasonable parental care).
- The nature of the statutory functions relied on did not entail an assumption or undertaking of responsibility towards the children to perform those functions with reasonable care.
- There was nothing in the manner in which the local authority behaved towards the children from which an assumption could be inferred (paras [74, 78-83, 90](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

Was the local authority vicariously liable for its social workers' failure to protect the children?

There was no doubt that in investigating the children's plight the social workers were under a contractual duty to the local authority to exercise proper professional skill and care. However, they did not owe a similar duty to the children in tort because there was no suggestion that the social workers provided advice on which the mother would foreseeably rely, Hedley Bryne followed. Nor was there anything to suggest that the children and their mother had entrusted the social workers with the conduct of their affairs so that an assumption of responsibility should be implied, _[Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc [1995] 2 A.C. 296, [1994] 7 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB7D9CCE1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8a95b898c65491799af7f331cbd5e08&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered (paras [86-88](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

Outcome

The particulars of claim did not set out an arguable claim that the local authority owed the children a duty of care and the judge had been entitled to strike out their claim (paras [91-92](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
