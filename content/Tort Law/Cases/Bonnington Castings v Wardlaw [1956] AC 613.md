# Bonnington Castings v Wardlaw [1956] AC 613

The claimant contracted pneumoconiosis by inhaling air which contained minute  
particles of silica during the course of his employment. The defendant was in breach of a statutory duty in failing to provide an extractor fan. Had they installed an extractor fan the number of particles of silica that the claimant was exposed to would have been reduced, however, there would still be some particles present. There were thus two possible causes: the guilty dust, which should not have been in the working environment and the innocent dust, which would have been present in any event. The trial judge held that where the duty arose by statute then it was for the defendant to show that his breach of duty (the guilty dust) did not cause the disease. As the defendant was unable to do this they were liable. The defendant appealed contending the burden of proof rests on the claimant.  

  

Held:  

  

The burden of proof remains on the claimant. However, the claimant only had to demonstrate that the guilty dust had made a material contribution to the disease. He did not have to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the guilty dust was the sole cause of the disease.

## Abstract

Where an employee alleges that he has been injured as a result of a breach of statutory duty by his employer, he must not only prove that there has been such a breach but also that his injury was caused by it, the standard of proof being the ordinary standard of proof in civil actions.

The respondent was employed by the appellants for eight years in the dressing shop of their foundry, and while so employed he contracted pneumoconiosis by inhaling air which contained minute particles of silica. The respondent was exposed to noxious dust from swing grinders, and it was admitted that the appellants were in breach of the Grinding of Metals (Miscellaneous Industries) Regulations 1925 Reg.1 , because the dust-extraction plant for these grinders was not kept free from obstruction as it should have been: it frequently became choked and ineffective.

Held, on the facts, the swing grinders contributed a quota of silica dust which was not negligible to the respondent's lungs and helped to produce the disease from which he suffered; accordingly the appellants were liable. _[Vyner v Waldenburg Bros Ltd [1946] K.B. 50, [1945] 7 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE7D67FB0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e78a1706dec94212bb57a6526b34a828&contextData=(sc.Default))_ explained and distinguished.
