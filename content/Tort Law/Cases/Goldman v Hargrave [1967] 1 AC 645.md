# Goldman v Hargrave [1967] 1 AC 645

## Facts

A 100-foot red gum tree on the defendant’s land was struck by lightning and caught fire. The following morning the defendant contacted a tree feller to cut down the tree, saw it into sections. The wood was still smouldering, and the defendant failed to douse it with water to eliminate the risk of fire. Over the next few days the weather became very hot and reignited the fire which spread to neighbouring property.

## Held

The defendant was liable for the naturally occurring danger that arose on his land, as he was aware of the danger and failed to act with reasonable prudence to remove the hazard.

1. A fire which first starts accidentally, is then brought under control, but later revives through negligence and spreads does not “accidentally begin” within the defence afforded by the [Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Act 1774 s.86](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA3BB5DA0E44611DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e2eddfdd989b4fa6ac3ff8b030dfaace&contextData=(sc.Default)).
2. 2. There is a general duty of care on an occupier of land on which a hazard to his neighbour arises to do what is reasonable in the circumstances to remove or reduce the hazard. A tall redgum tree in the centre of D's land in Western Australia was struck by lightning and caught fire. D called a tree feller and had the tree felled but then, instead of extinguishing the fire with water as he could have done, he left it to burn out. A wind came up and revived the fire, which spread to P's neighbouring land and did damage there. In an action for damages by P against D, held that D was, in the circumstances, negligent in not putting out the fire with water and the Act provided no defence.
