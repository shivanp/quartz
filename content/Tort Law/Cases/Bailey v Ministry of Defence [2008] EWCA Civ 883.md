# Bailey v Ministry of Defence [2008] EWCA Civ 883

#key-case

The claimant was severely ill in hospital, and choked on her own vomit, causing brain damage. The likely cause of her choking on her vomit was that she was in a very weak state. The weakness had two potential causes:

1. the natural progression of the claimant's condition (non-tortious); and
2. the negligent lack of care by the defendant (tortious).

Both causes worked together (cumulatively) to cause her weakness. The medical experts were unable to say whether the negligent treatment was on the balance of probabilities the cause of the claimant's brain damage – they could not say that without the negligence, she would not have been weak and would not have suffered brain damage. The Court of Appeal therefore applied the material contribution test and concluded that factual causation was satisfied because the negligence materially contributed to the brain damage.

Lord Justice Waller said,

> “In a case where medical science cannot establish the probability that 'but for' an act of negligence the injury would not have happened but can establish that the contribution of the negligent cause was more than negligible, the 'but for' test is modified, and [the claimant] will succeed.”
