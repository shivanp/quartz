# Hunter and Others v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] AC 655

#key-case

Around 700 claimants' TV reception had been interfered with as a result of a tower constructed in Canary Wharf. Several of the claimants’ claims in private nuisance failed as they had no legal interest in the land affected; for example, they were family members living with the homeowner. An action in private nuisance could only be brought by those with a **legal interest in the land affected ie the owner, tenant in possession, grantees of an easement or licensee with exclusive possession.** The claims of those who did have a legal interest in the land affected failed on the grounds that there was nothing emanating from the defendant’s land.

## Summary

A person's right to build on their land was not restricted because their building might interfere with a neighbour's enjoyment of the land. A nuisance action based on interference due to noise, dirt or smell might succeed, whereas interference with a television signal would not.

## Abstract

H and others brought an action in nuisance with regard to interference caused to their television reception as a result of the construction of the Canary Wharf Tower. H appealed against a Court of Appeal ruling that no action lay in private nuisance for interference with a television signal caused by the mere presence of a building, and CW cross-appealed against a ruling that the mere occupation of property as a home entitled an occupier to sue in private nuisance.

## Held

Appeal dismissed, cross-appeal allowed.

(Lord Cooke dissenting as to entitlement to sue for private nuisance)

(1) As to the right to sue in private nuisance, it had for many years been regarded as settled law that a person who had no right in the affected land could not sue for private nuisance, _[Malone v Laskey [1907] 2 K.B. 141, [1907] 3 WLUK 85](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IED80A720E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b6ac9b48652e4e0780ac5b907ab524ee&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. Recently the Court of Appeal had departed from this line of authority in _[Khorasandjian v Bush [1993] Q.B. 727, [1993] 2 WLUK 211](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID3E4DDE0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b6ac9b48652e4e0780ac5b907ab524ee&contextData=(sc.Default))_, where the plaintiff had been held able to sue for harassing phone calls received at her parents' home. That case must be overruled in so far as it decided that a mere licensee could sue in private nuisance, Khorasandjian overruled in part. The only exception to the necessity for the plaintiff to have title in the affected land was if he was in exclusive possession of the land although he could not prove title to it, _[Foster v Warblington Urban DC [1906] 1 K.B. 648, [1906] 4 WLUK 5](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA8A0AA10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b6ac9b48652e4e0780ac5b907ab524ee&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. The decision of the Court of Appeal was overruled as to any extension of entitlement to sue for private nuisance. (Per Lord Cooke) Occupation of the property as a home was an acceptable criteria for entitlement to sue in private nuisance.

(2) In relation to the interference with television reception, there was no reported case where an easement against the interruption of radio or television signals had yet been recognised. The closest analogy was with interrupted prospect, which could not be acquired by prescription but only by agreement or express grant. Unless restricted by covenant the owner was entitled to put up whatever he choose on his own land even though his neighbour's view was interrupted. The interruption of view would carry with it various consequences. It might reduce amenity generally, or it might impede more particular things such as the transmission of visual signals to the land from other properties. That might be highly inconvenient and it might even diminish the value of the land which was affected. But the proprietor of the affected land had nevertheless no actionable ground of complaint. Radio and television signals fell into the same category. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the developer to have become aware of their existence before he put up the new building. If he were to be restricted by an easement from putting up a building which interfered with these signals, he might not be able to put up any substantial structures at all. The interference with his freedom would be substantial. It would be inconsistent with principle for such a wide and novel restriction to be recognised.
