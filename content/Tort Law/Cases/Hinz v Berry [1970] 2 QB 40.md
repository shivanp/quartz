# Hinz v Berry [1970] 2 QB 40

A family stopped to have lunch when a car crashed into the field and killed the claimantâ€™s husband and injured her children. The claimant claimed damages for:

1. Grief and sorrow;
2. worry about her children and how they would cope with losing their father;
3. financial strain adjusting to life as a widow; and
4. depression caused by the shock of witnessing the accident.

The court only allowed damages in relation to the depression, as this was the only part of the claim which related to the shock of seeing the horrific event. Grief, sorrow, and worry were not medically recognised psychiatric illnesses.
