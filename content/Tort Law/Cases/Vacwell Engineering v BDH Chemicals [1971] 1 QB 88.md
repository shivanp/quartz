# Vacwell Engineering v BDH Chemicals [1971] 1 QB 88

The claimant suffered extensive property damage following the defendant's negligence in causing a chemical explosion (chemicals came into contact with water). A minor explosion was reasonably foreseeable as a result of the defendant's breach. However, the explosion that did occur was of a magnitude which was not reasonably foreseeable.

**HELD:** the damage was not too remote for the claimant to recover the full extent of the loss. The type of damage that was foreseeable was property damage caused by an explosion. It was irrelevant that the defendant could not foresee the magnitude of such an explosion and so they were liable for the full extent of the property damage.
