# McGuinn v Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust [2017] EWHC 88 (QB)

## Summary

The claimant, whose daughter had been born severely disabled, had established that those responsible for her medical care during her pregnancy had breached their duty of care in failing to appreciate that the foetus was at risk of suffering from a condition called microcephaly.

## Abstract

The claimant brought a claim for clinical negligence against the defendant NHS trust.

In 2007, the claimant had become pregnant for the second time. In 2008, she underwent 10 ultrasound scans at a hospital for which the trust was responsible. After the birth of her daughter in August 2008, the child was found to be suffering from severe neurodevelopmental impairment. She was profoundly physically and cognitively disabled. Although the precise cause of those disabilities was unclear, her head was diagnosed to be microcephalic, a condition known to give rise to a substantial risk of physical and mental abnormalities.

The claimant's case was that, given the features revealed on the scans, including a small foetal head circumference, a decrease in growth rate, slightly enlarged cerebral ventricles and the presence of a single umbilical artery, those responsible for her care should have been aware that the foetus was at risk of suffering from microcephaly. That would have entailed her being referred for further investigations and assessment at a tertiary-level centre, which would have alerted her to the substantial risk of physical and mental abnormalities associated with the condition. Had she been aware of that risk, she would have terminated her pregnancy.

The trust denied negligence, asserting that there was no or insufficient evidence that the foetus was at risk of suffering from microcephaly. The claimant relied on the expert evidence of a consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician. The trust relied on the expert evidence of a consultant in foeto-maternal medicine.

The issue was whether a breach of the relevant duty of care had been established. Other issues, including causation, were not before the court.

## Held

Judgment for claimant.

The clinicians who had undertaken the fifth and seventh scans (the consultant in charge of the claimant's care and a specialist in foetal medicine respectively) had been negligent. The results of those scans provided sufficient evidence from which no reasonable clinician should have failed to appreciate that the foetus was at risk of suffering from microcephaly so as to require, at the fifth scan, either referral for further investigation and assessment or at least a re-scan at 32 weeks' gestation, and, at the seventh scan, referral for further investigation and assessment.

As to the expert evidence, the conclusions of the trust's expert were, in relation to a number of important and relevant issues, inconsistent with the foetal scan measurements and reports. Most importantly, they also lacked a sufficiently logical and rational basis. His overall opinion failed to take into account both the combination of relevant factors which were present and the context in which the issues were required to be considered, namely whether there was sufficient evidence that the foetus was at risk of suffering from microcephaly so as to require the claimant's referral for further investigation and assessment.

In contrast, the opinions of the claimant's expert were logically based. His more nuanced approach of taking into account all the relevant evidence disclosed by the various scan measurements and reports, rather than compartmentalising it, was more rational. It was an approach which reflected reasonable, rather than inappropriately high, standards of clinical care (see paras [175-178](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).
