# Wieland v Cyril Lord Carpets Ltd [1969] 3 All ER 1006

## Facts

Mrs Wieland injured her neck due to the defendant’s negligence, meaning she had to wear a neck brace. She wore bi-focal glasses and, unbeknownst to her, the neck brace made her unable to properly adjust her head inhibited her sight and awareness. As a result of this, she fell down some stairs at the hospital, causing further injury.

## Claim

Wieland brought a claim in the tort of negligence for both her injured neck and the injury caused by her subsequent fall. The defendant argued that the claimant’s own acts broke the chain of causation, and therefore meant they weren’t liable for the second injury.

## Held

The defendant was held liable for the subsequent harm from the fall. The claimant’s own acts did not constitute a novus actus interveniens.

## Reasoning

The Court held that the subsequent injury from the fall was attributable to the initial injury. Eveleigh J defined the appropriate test through foreseeability, stating:

> If it can be said that it is foreseeable that one injury may affect a person’s ability to cope with the vicissitudes of life and thereby be a cause of another injury and if foreseeability is required, that is to say, if foreseeability is the right word in this context, foreseeability of the general nature will, in my view, suffice.

In this case, the claimant had been wearing bi-focal glasses for over 10 year,. Using them had therefore become a force of habit. It was therefore reasonable that she would not appreciate the effect of the neck brace on her sight, especially given the injury was sustained soon after the brace was put on. Consequently, the defendant was held liable for the injury suffered from the fall.
