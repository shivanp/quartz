# Weller & Co v Foot & Mouth Disease Research Institute [1965] 3 All ER 560

#key-case

## Facts

The claimant agricultural auction house claimed for lost profits against the defendant. The defendant had negligently released the foot and mouth virus and infected local cattle, resulting in a cattle movement ban and the cancellation of local auctions.

## Held

The claim was unsuccessful as it was for pure economic loss. The claimant had suffered no damage to their own property. Their losses flowed from damage to cattle owned by local farmers. If a farmer had claimed for lost profits by reason of not being able to sell an infected cow, the claim would have succeeded as that would have been consequential economic loss (economic loss flowing from property damage).

### Abstract

The defendants occupied premises where they carried out experiments concerning foot and mouth disease. Cattle in the vicinity became infected, and two cattle markets in the area had to be closed. The plaintiffs, auctioneers, claimed against the defendants damages for loss of business. It was assumed that the defendants had imported an African virus onto their premises which had escaped and caused the outbreak of disease; the court's decision was sought as to whether the defendants owed to the plaintiffs a duty to take reasonable care, and whether they had an absolute duty to the plaintiffs to ensure that the virus did not escape.

Held, that

(1) the defendants owed no duty to the plaintiffs who were not cattle owners and had no proprietary interest in anything which could be damaged by the virus;

(2) the defendants owed no absolute duty to the plaintiffs to ensure that the virus did not escape, as the plaintiffs had no interest in any land to which the virus could have escaped.
