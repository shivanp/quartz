# Rhind v Astbury Water Park Ltd [2004] EWCACiv 756

The claimant dived into a lake and suffered head injuries when he hit his head on a fibreglass container. The container was not visible from the surface and therefore the defendants had no knowledge, nor reasonable grounds for them to believe, that the container was there. No duty was owed.
