# Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd [1973] 1 QB 27

#key-case

## Facts

The claimant manufactured steel alloys, a process requiring continuous power to maintain the temperature in the furnace. The defendant's employee negligently damaged the cable that supplied electricity to the claimant's factory, which required the power to be shut off for 14 hours. This meant the metal being processed at the time was ruined. The claimant was unable to sell the ruined metal and consequently suffered a loss of profit. In addition, the claimant claimed that they could have made profit from processing four further melts during the shut-down. The damaged electricity cable did not belong to the claimants.

## Held

Damaged metal was physical damage (property damage) and a duty of care was owed in respect of the property damage. So this loss was recoverable.

Loss of profit on damaged metal was a consequential economic loss (loss of profit was a direct consequence of the property damage) and a duty of care was owed in respect of the consequential economic loss. This was recoverable.

Loss of profit on the four further melts was pure economic loss (economic loss which did not result from any damage to the claimantâ€™s property or person). This loss resulted from damage to the electricity cable, which belonged to a third party. No duty of care was owed in respect of the pure economic loss, and it was not recoverable. Note that if the claimant had owned the electricity cable, this would have been consequential economic loss and therefore recoverable.
