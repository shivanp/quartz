# A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289

The claimants sued the National Blood Authority under the Act as a result of personal injuries arising from their being transfused with blood infected by hepatitis. The defendant argued that it had taken all reasonable care to ensure that the blood was safe and that this is all the public is entitled to expect. Burton J. disagreed and set the standard somewhat higher. He noted that a patient undergoing a transfusion is legitimately entitled to expect that they will not be given infected blood, and that to hold otherwise would be to offer no more protection than the tort of negligence and to take strict liability out of a strict liability regime. It is therefore clear that when assessing expectations of a product the bar should be set higher than the negligence standard of reasonable care.

## Summary

Following their infection with hepatitis C as a result of blood transfusions, a number of claimants sought damages under Council Directive 85/374 and the Consumer Protection Act 1987. They argued that the National Blood Authority, which had assumed responsibility for the administration of blood transfusions, was liable under Art.6 of the Directive, despite the absence of fault, and that the authority could not rely on Art.7(e) by contending that it had taken all possible steps to avoid infection. Giving judgment for the claimants, the court held that the blood had been defective within the meaning of Art.6. The "existence of the defect" under Art.7(3) referred to a generic defect whereby there was a risk that the defect could materialise in any product. Where, as in this case, a known risk had existed, a producer could not evade responsibility by arguing that he had not been able to identify the products in which the defect would occur.

## Abstract

Following their infection with hepatitis C through blood transfusions, a number of claimants sought damages under [Council Directive 85/374](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE7483F21CA574E2BB8D10955A04E6F6E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8775927a26a54441badf209156e6d09c&contextData=(sc.Default)) and the [Consumer Protection Act 1987](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FFD1220E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8775927a26a54441badf209156e6d09c&contextData=(sc.Default)) , which had been passed in order to implement the Directive in domestic law. The claimants contended that N, which had assumed responsibility for the administration of blood transfusions, was strictly liable under Art.6 of the Directive, despite the absence of fault. N, relying upon Art.7(e) of the Directive submitted that it was not liable since the extent of scientific knowledge at the time the transfusions had taken place meant that, while there was a known risk that some blood products might be infected, the absence of a screening test meant that the risk of supplying a defective blood product was unavoidable.

Held, giving judgment for A, that the blood was defective within the meaning of Art.6 and consequently N, as the producer of a defective product, was liable under Art.6. The question of avoidability of the harmful characteristic, the impracticability of taking precautionary measures and the benefit of the product to society as a whole, were not factors which the court was required to consider when determining liability under Art.6.

Public knowledge of the risks could be a relevant consideration in the determination of liability, but while the risks in the instant case had been appreciated by the medical profession, they had not been made known to, or accepted by, the wider public. Art.7(e) did not afford a defence where it was known that a particular product could have harmful consequences; N could not, on the facts, evade responsibility, since the existence of the defect was generic and there was, and had been, a known risk of the virus materialising in any product. N had continued to supply blood products and that had to be at its own risk, as the public were entitled to expect that blood transfused to them would be free from infection.
