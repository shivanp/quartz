# Delaney v Pickett [2011] EWCA Civ 1532

The claimant was injured in a motor vehicle accident due to the defendant's negligent driving. The claimant was found to be carrying a large packet of cannabis which the claimant and defendant were travelling to sell. The defence of illegality failed because the **claimant's injury was not caused by his illegal act**, the illegality merely provided the occasion for the injury. Selling drugs did not cause his injuries.
