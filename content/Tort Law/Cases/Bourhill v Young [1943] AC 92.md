# Bourhill v Young [1943] AC 92

The defendant motorcyclist crashed and killed himself by his own negligence. The claimant, who was pregnant, did not see the crash but heard it and later saw some blood on the road. She suffered from a shock-induced still birth. It was held that no duty of care was owed to the claimant. Whilst it was foreseeable that the defendant might physically harm other road users with his negligent driving, it was not foreseeable that someone in the claimant's position of normal fortitude would suffer psychiatric harm.
