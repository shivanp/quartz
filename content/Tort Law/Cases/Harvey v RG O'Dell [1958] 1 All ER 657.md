# Harvey v RG O'Dell [1958] 1 All ER 657

A workman driving negligently injured a colleague who was his passenger. At the time, they were travelling five miles during working hours to get lunch. This was incidental to the workman's work and therefore within the course of employment. Stopping to take a lunch break was a reasonably expected act by an employee.
