# Swain v Natui Ram Puri [1996] PIQR P442

The defendant erected a seven foot-fence topped with barbed wire around their factory. There was a small section of the fence where barbed wire was missing, and the nine-year-old claimant entered the premises. He used a ladder to climb onto the roof and fell through a skylight, sustaining serious injuries. There was no breach by the defendant as they erected the fence which was evidence of reasonable steps to protect against the danger of individuals falling through the roof, and there was no evidence of previous trespass.

No duty was owed as the factory was defunct, the defendant had not seen any children in the area and there had been no signs of trespass.
