# Page v Smith [1996] AC 155

The claimant had suffered from ME over a period of time and was in recovery when he was involved in a minor car accident due to the defendant's negligence. The claimant was not physically injured in the collision, but the incident triggered his ME and had become chronic and permanent so that he was unable to return to his job as a teacher. He was successful at his trial and awarded Â£162,000 in damages.  

  

Held:  

  

Provided some kind of personal injury was foreseeable, it did not matter whether the injury was physical or psychiatric. There was thus no need to establish that psychiatric injury was foreseeable. Also the fact that an ordinary person would not have suffered the injury incurred by the claimant was irrelevant as the defendant must take his victim as he finds him under the thin skull rule.

## Abstract

Once it was established that D was under a duty of care to avoid causing personal injury to P, it was unnecessary to ask whether D should have reasonably foreseen injury by shock. Instead, it was sufficient to ask whether D should have reasonably foreseen that P might suffer personal injury as a result of D's negligence. P had been involved in an accident with a car driven by D. P had suffered no physical injury but had previously suffered from myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). P claimed that, as a result of the accident, his condition had worsened and brought an action against D, claiming damages for personal injuries caused by D's negligence. The trial judge found for P and awarded him damages. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by D on the ground that injury by nervous shock to P was not reasonably foreseeable by D.

Held, allowing P's appeal (by a three to two majority), that in cases of nervous shock it was essential to distinguish between primary and secondary victims. Where P was a primary victim, and it was established that D was under a duty of care to avoid causing personal injury to P, it was enough to ask whether D should have reasonably foreseen that P might suffer personal injury as a result of D's negligence. It was unnecessary to ask, as a separate question, whether D should have foreseen injury by shock, _[Bourhill v Young [1943] A.C. 92, [1942] 8 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I77000B40E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=17367a5bcfd3441589ea68b9e7e98f6a&contextData=(sc.Search))_, _[King v Phillips [1953] 1 Q.B. 429, [1953] 2 WLUK 83](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID43743A0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=17367a5bcfd3441589ea68b9e7e98f6a&contextData=(sc.Search))_, _[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co (The Wagon Mound) [1961] A.C. 388, [1961] 1 WLUK 865](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I14EB2330E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=17367a5bcfd3441589ea68b9e7e98f6a&contextData=(sc.Search))_, _[Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1992] 1 A.C. 310, [1991] 11 WLUK 392](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I546B3320E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=17367a5bcfd3441589ea68b9e7e98f6a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered.
