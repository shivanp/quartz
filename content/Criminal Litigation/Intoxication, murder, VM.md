# Intoxication, murder, VM

The impact of intoxication on whether a defendant is criminally liable for murder or voluntary manslaughter is considered.

Intoxication can be used both:

- as a way to negate the _mens rea_ of murder; or
- as an influencing factor on the special defences of loss of control and diminished responsibility.

If D is intoxicated loss of control and/ or diminished responsibility can still be potentially argued as partial defences to murder, reducing the conviction to voluntary manslaughter if successful.

Intoxication can mean with drugs or alcohol.

## Negating _mens rea_

A defendant can use evidence of their intoxication to show that they did not form the necessary _mens rea_ for murder - that the defendant did not form the _mens rea_ of intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the victim.

Remember, the prosecution need to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the defendant has committed the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ of murder. If, due to intoxication, the defendant did not form the _mens rea_ of murder, then the defendant will be entitled to an acquittal.

## Loss of Control

The interaction between intoxication and the defence of loss of control was explained in [[R v Asmelash [2013] EWCA Crim 157]] of where Lord Judge stated:

> 'It does not mean that the defendant who has been drinking is deprived of any possible loss of control defence: it simply means, as the judge explained, that the loss of control defence must be approached without reference to the defendant's voluntary intoxication.
>
> If a sober individual in the defendant's circumstances, with normal levels of tolerance and self-restraint might have behaved in the same way as the defendant confronted by the relevant qualifying trigger, he would not be deprived of the loss of control defence just because he was not sober. And different considerations would arise if, a defendant with a severe problem with alcohol or drugs was mercilessly taunted about the condition, to the extent that it constituted a qualifying trigger, the alcohol or drug problem would then form part of the circumstances for consideration.'

In [[R v Morhall [1996] AC 90]] the defendant was addicted to glue and had been taunted about his glue-sniffing habit and how it made him a hopeless character, incapable of employment. The fact that he was addicted to glue was relevant in assessing the gravity of the provocation, but the jury had to consider whether a reasonable man, who was not high on glue, would have done what he did. So, the law is unchanged and directs us as follows:

1. Defendant is not precluded from using the defence just because he is drunk;
2. His intoxication will be ignored in accordance with the [Coroners and Justice Act (CJA) 2009, s 54(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/55) (as a circumstance whose only relevance to D’s conduct is that it bears on D’s general capacity for tolerance or self-restraint), if it has no connection to the things said or done which make up the qualifying trigger; and
3. If there is a connection between the things said or done which make up the qualifying trigger, e.g., when the defendant is taunted about his intoxication, then the jury can take that intoxication into account in assessing the gravity of the qualifying trigger.

## Diminished Responsibility

The impact of intoxication on the defence of diminished responsibility is an issue with which the courts have long struggled. What follows is an outline on how the courts have dealt with this, which, it is believed, remains the position for this defence despite the modification of the [HA 1957, s 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/11/section/2).

The courts have taken two approaches, depending on whether the intoxication is:

- independent of the abnormalitythe defendant has an abnormality of mental functioning and is voluntarily intoxicated; or
- as a result of alcohol dependency syndrome (‘ADS’).

## Intoxication Independent of the Abnormality

A defendant might, at the time of the killing suffer from both an abnormality of mental functioning and from the effect of alcohol taken before the killing. The leading authority on this situation before the amendments was [[R v Dietschmann [2003] 1 AC 1209]], where the House of Lords suggested that it would be an impossible task for the jury simply to ignore the effect of the alcohol and decide whether the defendant, sober, would still have killed as a result of the abnormality. Instead, the jury must first consider the effect of the matters other than the alcohol and determine whether they amounted to such abnormality of mental functioning as might have substantially impaired the defendant's ability to do one of the things in the HA 1957, s 2(1A). From that case, the jury should consider:

> 'If the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the killing, the jury should then ask themselves: has the defendant satisfied you that, despite the drink,
>
> (1) he was suffering from mental abnormality; and
>
> (2) his mental abnormality substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his fatal acts?'

Note that, in these circumstances, the jury may still find that the defence operates, even if they consider that the alcohol may have played a part in the defendant's inability to do one of the factors in the HA 1957, s 2(1A).

In [[R v Kay [2017] EWCA Crim 647]], the Court of Appeal in considering the amended defence of diminished responsibility said that it was bound by the case of [[R v Dietschmann [2003] 1 AC 1209]], so it is clear that this case remains the authority to be applied.

In [[R v Dowds [2012] EWCA Crim 281]], Hughes LJ (as he then was) said:

> ‘It is enough to say that it is quite clear that the reformulation of the statutory conditions for diminished responsibility was not intended to reverse the well established rule that voluntary acute intoxication is not capable of being relied upon to found diminished responsibility. That remains the law. The presence of a “recognised medical condition” is a necessary, but not always a sufficient, condition to raise the issue of diminished responsibility.’

## Alcohol Dependency Syndrome

In [[R v Wood [2008] EWCA Crim 1305]] the Court of Appeal acknowledged that it was somewhat artificial to draw a distinction where that defendant has ADS between purely involuntary drinking and drinking where the defendant has some ability to stop. Instead, the jury must decide whether the ADS was a significant factor in leading the defendant to consume the alcohol, even if there was an element of voluntary choice either to start drinking or not to stop at some point. If they decide that it was a significant factor, they can conclude that the defendant's responsibility was impaired as a result of the abnormality of mental functioning.

In [[R v Stewart [2009] EWCA Crim 593]] further guidance was given as to how a judge should direct the jury in cases involving ADS.

1. The jury must be satisfied that there was an abnormality of mind (which would now be an abnormality of mental functioning). Evidence of ADS may well assist the jury here. However, it would, depending on the evidence, be open to them to conclude that, notwithstanding the existence of the condition, at the time of the killing, the defendant was not suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning.
2. If the jury are satisfied that the defendant was suffering from an abnormality, they then need to be satisfied that this arises from a recognised medical condition. If there is clear evidence of ADS, then this requirement is likely to be satisfied. Any attempt to rely on voluntary and temporary drunkenness, even when based on habitual heavy binge-drinking, will not be sufficient.
3. Under the old law, the Court of Appeal directed that the jury must consider whether the ADS substantially impaired the defendant's mental responsibility. The Court of Appeal suggested a number of factors that may assist the jury in deciding this:
	1. the extent and seriousness of the defendant’s dependency;
	2. the extent to which his ability to control his drinking was reduced;
	3. whether he was capable of abstinence and if so;
	4. for how long, and;
	5. whether he was choosing for some particular reason (such as a birthday) to decide to get drunk or to drink more than usual.

Without seeking to be prescriptive about considerations relevant to an individual case, the defendant's pattern of drinking in the days leading to the day of the killing, and on the day of the killing itself, and notwithstanding his consumption of alcohol, his ability, if any, to make apparently sensible and rational decisions about ordinary day-to-day matters at the relevant time, may all bear on the jury's decision whether diminished responsibility is established in the context of this individual defendant's alcohol dependency syndrome.

In [[R v Kay [2017] EWCA Crim 647]], the above approach was approved. Hallett LJ:

> ‘[W]e see no reason to depart from the approach in R v Stewart. Coupled with the provisions of section 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957(as substituted), it provides a clear and sensible approach for directing the jury. The approach is neither binary nor simplistic but is flexible enough to encompass a wide variety of factual circumstances in a manner that is fair to all.’

It is suggested that the same considerations will be made when determining whether the defendant is able to do one of the things in [HA 1957, s 2(1A)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/11/section/2).
