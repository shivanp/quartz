# Criminal Procedure

## Key Personnel

### Defence Solicitors

Most defendants will be represented by a solicitor. The defence solicitor will provide advice and assistance to a suspect in the police station, before the suspect is charged. If the suspect is charged, the defence solicitor will represent them in the magistrates' / Crown Court.

### Police

Investigate criminal offences. Includes power to stop and search suspected offenders, powers to search premises and the power to arrest suspects. The police have additional powers following an arrest.

The National Crime Agency investigates serious, organised and complex crime.

### CPS

Responsible for prosecuting individuals. The head of CPS is the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Responsibility for deciding the charge the suspect faces rests with the CPS rather than the police. Representatives from the CPS are based in police stations.

After a suspect has been charged, the CPS retains responsibility for the prosecution of the case. CPS is an independent organisation.

A prosecution should be brought if:

1. There is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and
2. It is in the public interest for a prosecution to be brought.

### Magistrates' Court

![[Magistrates' Court]]

### Crown Court

![[Crown Court]]

### Probation Service

Representative always present in court when a case is being heard. Responsible for compiling pre-sentence reports on a defendant who has been convicted. Focus on D's background, previous convictions and likelihood of re-offending.

### Criminal Legal Aid

Legal Aid Agency (LLA) provides funding for Ds either by entering a “standard crime contract” with solicitors in private practice, or providing salaried public defenders.

## Classification of Offences

### Indictable-only Offences

- Most serious form of criminal offence
- Magistrate will immediately send the case to the Crown Court for trial.
- e.g., murder, rape, robbery

![[indictable-only-offences.png]]

### Either Way Offences

- If the magistrate decides to keep the case before them, D has the right to elect trial by a judge and jury in the Crown Court.
- e.g., theft, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, burglary.
- Low-value shoplifting (value of the stolen goods is $<£200$) is a summary offence (s 22A Magistrates' Courts Act 1980) but if an adult D pleads not guilty, can elect a Crown Court trial.

![[either-way-offences.png]]

### Summary Offences

Least serious form of criminal offence, dealt with only by the magistrates' court.

![[summary-offences.png]]

## Criminal Procedure Rules

April 2005 – procedural rules for criminal court consolidated into the CrimPR, as supplemented by the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction.

### Overriding Objective

> [!statute] r 1.1 Criminal Procedure Rules 2020 - The overriding objective
> 
> (1) The overriding objective of this procedural code is that criminal cases be dealt with justly.
> 
> (2) Dealing with a criminal case justly includes―
> - (a) acquitting the innocent and convicting the guilty;
> - (b) dealing with the prosecution and the defence fairly;
> - (c) recognising the rights of a defendant, particularly those under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights;
> - (d) respecting the interests of witnesses, victims and jurors and keeping them informed of the progress of the case;
> - (e) dealing with the case efficiently and expeditiously;
> - (f) ensuring that appropriate information is available to the court when bail and sentence are considered; and
> - (g) dealing with the case in ways that take into account―
> 	- (i) the gravity of the offence alleged,
> 	- (ii) the complexity of what is in issue,
> 	- (iii) the severity of the consequences for the defendant and others affected, and
> 	- (iv) the needs of other cases. 

### Duty of Participants

> [!statute] r 1.2 CrimPR - The duty of the participants in a criminal case
> (1) Each participant, in the conduct of each case, must―
> - (a) prepare and conduct the case in accordance with the overriding objective;
> - (b) comply with these Rules, practice directions and directions made by the court; and
> - (c) at once inform the court and all parties of any significant failure (whether or not that participant is responsible for that failure) to take any procedural step required by these Rules, any practice direction or any direction of the court. A failure is significant if it might hinder the court in furthering the overriding objective.
> 
> (2) Anyone involved in any way with a criminal case is a participant in its conduct for the purposes of this rule.
> 

### Case Management Powers

The court must further the overriding objective (r 3.2(1)) by actively managing the case (r 3.2(1)).

> [!statute] r 3.2(2)
> Active case management includes―
> - (a) the early identification of the real issues;
> - (b) the early identification of the needs of witnesses;
> - (c) achieving certainty as to what must be done, by whom, and when, in particular by the early setting of a timetable for the progress of the case;
> - (d) monitoring the progress of the case and compliance with directions;
> - (e) ensuring that evidence, whether disputed or not, is presented in the shortest and clearest way;
> - (f) discouraging delay, dealing with as many aspects of the case as possible on the same occasion, and avoiding unnecessary hearings;
> - (g) encouraging the participants to co-operate in the progression of the case; and
> - (h) making use of technology.

Parties must actively assist the court in its duty to manage the case (r 3.3), since failure to do so is inconsistent with the overriding objective ([[R (on the application of DPP) v Chorley [2006] EWHC 1795]]).

- At the beginning of a case, each party must nominate an individual responsible for the progress of the case, and must tell the other parties and the court who that individual is and how he may be contacted (r 3.4(1)).
- The court will nominate a “case progression officer”, ensuring the parties comply and keeping the court informed of anything affecting the case.
- The court is given the power to make any direction or take any step actively to manage a case, unless such a direction or step would contravene legislation (r 3.5).

> [!statute] r 3.8 - Case preparation and progression
> (1) At every hearing, if a case cannot be concluded there and then the court must give directions so that it can be concluded at the next hearing or as soon as possible after that.
> 
> (2) At every hearing the court must, where relevant―
> - (a) if the defendant is absent, decide whether to proceed nonetheless;
> - (b) take the defendant’s plea (unless already done) or if no plea can be taken then find out whether the defendant is likely to plead guilty or not guilty;
> - (c) set, follow or revise a timetable for the progress of the case, which may include a timetable for any hearing including the trial or (in the Crown Court) the appeal;
> - (d) in giving directions, ensure continuity in relation to the court and to the parties’ representatives where that is appropriate and practicable; and
> - (e) where a direction has not been complied with, find out why, identify who was responsible, and take appropriate action. 

## Professional Conduct

### Rule of Law and Administration of Justice

- All solicitors in criminal proceedings have a duty not to mislead the court (para 1.4 SRA Code)
- This overrides Principle 7 – the duty to act in the client's best interests.

> [!conduct]
> If a client tells you they intend to give false evidence at court, the solicitor must tell the client that the solicitor will need to be withdrawn from acting for the client unless the client agrees not to do this. 

### Prosecution

Prosecuting advocates are under a duty to ensure that all material evidence supporting the prosecution is put before the court in a fair and dispassionate manner. Prosecution must:

1. Inform the court of any relevant authority, even if the authority favours D
2. Relevant facts known to the prosecutor should be placed before the court, including any facts relevant to mitigation.
3. If the prosecutor obtains evidence assisting D, they must supply particulars of the evidence to the defence; and
4. If a prosecution witness gives evidence inconsistent with any earlier statement by the witness, the prosecuting solicitor should disclose this fact to the defence.

### Defence

#### Instructions From a Third Party

If a friend/ relative contacts the solicitor asking them to attend the police station to advise the person, the solicitor should

- Phone the station and ask to speak to the arrested person, to determine whether they want a lawyer.
- Tell arrested person that they are entitled to free legal advice from a solicitor of their choice.

#### Client Admitting Guilt

The solicitor should advise the client that he would receive credit from the court if he entered an early guilty plea. If the client wishes to plead not guilty and insists on giving evidence from the witness box denying guilt, the solicitor should decline to act (since this would constitute misleading the court).

The solicitor may continue to act on a not guilty plea if D merely intends to put the prosecution to proof. This involves asking prosecution witnesses questions to undermine/ discredit their evidence. But such questioning should not suggest facts to the court which the defence solicitor knows to be false.

If the client admits guilt to their solicitor at the end of a trial, after the client has been acquitted, the solicitor should not take any steps. The solicitor owes a continuing duty of confidentiality to their client, so should not disclose the admission to anyone.

If a solicitor suspects that a defence is fabricated, but the client maintains that it is true, the solicitor will not risk breaching the overriding duty by placing the defence before the court.

If the client wishes to plead not guilty in the face of strong prosecution evidence, advise that they risk losing a reduced sentence, but that it is their choice.

#### Client Pleading Guilty Despite Defence

If a client has a defence available to them, they should be advised to plead not guilty and present the defence. If they insist on pleading guilty, a solicitor may continue to act, but should be advised that they will not then be able to raise a defence.

#### Inconsistent Instructions

If a client gives changing instructions, this is fine. But if instructions are changed with a view to putting forward false evidence to the court, the solicitor should refuse to act.

#### Disclosure of Defence

A solicitor owes a duty of confidentiality to their client. The solicitor should not disclose details of their client's case to any other party without the express consent of the client. Ideally, obtain a client's written consent before disclosing details of their defence.

#### Point of Law

- The defence solicitor has no duty to inform the prosecution of any evidence or witnesses that would prejudice D's case.
- A solicitor's duty is only a negative one: not to mislead the court by allowing evidence to be given by D which the solicitor knows is untrue.
- If a point of law is in dispute, D's solicitor is under a positive duty to assist the court by supplying any relevant authority, even if such authority is harmful to D's case.

#### Client Giving a False Name

If a client gives a false name, address or date of birth to the court, the solicitor should cease to act.

#### Knowledge of Previous Convictions

If the prosecution provide a list of D's previous convictions which is inaccurate/ incomplete and ask D's solicitor to confirm the accuracy of the list, they should decline to comment.

- To confirm the list as accurate would deceive the court
- To disclose previous convictions without client's express consent would be a breach of confidentiality.

#### Conflicts of Interest

A solicitor must not act for two (or more) defendants where there is a conflict of interest between them (SRA Code of Conduct, para 6.2). Most commonly: where two defendants are jointly accused of an offence and each blames the other.

If a conflict arises after the solicitor has begun to act for both D's, the solicitor should normally withdraw from the case entirely. Could only continue to act for one of the Ds if it would not risk breach of the duty of confidentiality they owe to the other. Unlikely to ever be the case in a criminal matter.

#### Interviewing Prosecution Witnesses

There is “no property in a witness”, but D solicitors should proceed with caution if intending to interview a prosecution witness. The usual course of action is to notify the prosecution that the witness is to be interviewed and invite a representative from the CPS to attend as an observer (safeguard against a latter allegation that the witness was pressured to change evidence).

#### Withdrawing From the Case

If a solicitor needs to withdraw from the case, the reason for withdrawal should not normally be given to the client (“for professional reasons” is a common euphemism).

## Legal Professional Privilege

Communications between a client and solicitor are privileged if the purpose is the giving or receiving of legal advice.

- The defence cannot be compelled to reveal the contents of such communications to any other party.
- D cannot be asked about their contents when being cross-examined.

Extends to communications between D and solicitor/ TP, if such communications are made in contemplation of pending/ anticipated proceedings and the dominant purpose was to prepare for the litigation.

## Human Rights

- s 3: interpreting and giving effect to legislation in a way which is compatible with the ECHR, as far as it is possible to do so.
- s 4: declaration of incompatibility
- s 6: it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.
	- Public authority includes a criminal court.
- s 8(1) HRA 1998: in relation to any act or proposed act of a public authority which is considered unlawful, the court may grant such remedy/ relief/ order as it considers just and appropriate.

## Procedure

A suspect who has been arrested must be taken to the police station “as soon as is practicable after the arrest” (s 30(1A) PACE 1984) unless the arresting officer decides to grant “street bail”.

- A suspect may be arrested at the police station.
- If the police do not have sufficient evidence to arrest a suspect, they may ask the person to attend voluntarily to the police station to ask questions.
	- s 29 PACE 1984: rights of a volunteer
	- Can leave at any time
	- Can request a friend/ solicitor be present at the interview.
- para 1.1 Code C: all persons in custody must be dealt with expeditiously, and be released as soon as the need for detention no longer applies.

### Custody Officer

The arrested suspect must be brought before a custody officer on his arrival at the police station. Responsible for authorising the detention of the suspect and supervising his welfare whilst at the police station. Normally a police officer of rank sergeant or above who is not involved in the investigation.

para 2.1A Code C: suspect who is arrested should be brought before the custody officer "as soon as is practicable".

#### Initial Steps

The custody officer should file a custody record, detailing:

- Suspect's details
- Offence for which the suspect has been arrested and why the arresting officer considered it necessary to arrest the suspect
- Time of suspect's arrest and arrival at station
- Reason why the suspect's ongoing detention had been authorised by the custody officer.
- Time detention authorised
- Confirmation that the suspect had been given details of the rights he may exercise
- Details of any items of property the suspect has on his person
- Details of medical conditions.

Custody officer may inform the suspect of his ongoing rights which may be exercised at any time while in custody:

- Right to have someone informed of suspect's arrest (s 56)
- Right for the suspect to consult privately with a solicitor (free legal advice available – s 58)
- Right to consult the Codes of Practice.
- Right to be informed about the offence and why they have been arrested and detained.

#### Search of Detained Person

Custody officer may search the suspect/ authorise a search of the suspect, to the extent considered necessary (para 4.1 Code C). Items on the suspect's person should be recorded (s 54(1) and (2)).

Section 54(3) permits the custody officer to seize and retain any items the suspect has on his person. Clothing and personal items can be taken if:

1. The custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that they may be evidence
2. The custody officer believes the suspect may use them:
	1. To cause physical injury
	2. To cause damage to property
	3. To interfere with evidence
	4. To assist in escaping (Code C, para 4.2).

## Detention at Police Station

### Sufficient Evidence

The custody officer must determine whether there is already sufficient evidence to charge the suspect with the offence for which he has been arrested (s 37(1)). Will ask the investigating officer for details of the evidence that already exists against the suspect, and what steps the officer proposes to take if the further detention of the suspect is authorised.

The custody officer should note in the custody record any comments made by the suspect in relation to the account given by the arresting officer of the reasons for the arrest (Code C, para 3.4). The custody officer should not himself put any questions to the arrested person about his involvement in any offence (Code C, para 3.4).

The custody officer may detain the suspect at the police station for as long as it is necessary for him to determine if sufficient evidence exists to charge the suspect.

### Grounds for Detention

If there is insufficient evidence, the suspect should be released with/ without bail unless:

1. The custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that detaining the suspect without charge is necessary to secure/ preserve evidence relating to an offence
	1. Useful if the police want to search the suspect's premises, under s 18.
2. It is necessary to obtain such evidence by questioning (s 37(2)).

If the custody officer becomes aware at any time that the grounds on which a suspect’s  
detention was authorised have ceased to apply, the suspect must be released immediately (s 39).

### Conditions of Detention

- The cell in which a suspect is held must be adequately heated, cleaned and ventilated, and also adequately lit (Code C, para 8.2).
- Any bedding supplied to a suspect must be of a reasonable standard and in a clean and sanitary condition (Code C, para 8.3).
- A suspect must be provided with access to toilet and washing facilities (Code C, para 8.4).
- A suspect must be offered at least two light meals and one main meal in any 24-hour period, and drinks should be provided at meal times and upon reasonable request between meals (Code C, para 8.6 and Note for Guidance 8B).
- A suspect should be offered brief outdoor exercise daily if this is practicable (Code C, para 8.7).
- Suspects should be visited in their cells at least every hour (Code C, para 9.3).
- If a suspect is injured/ appears to need clinical attention, the custody officer must make arrangements to ensure that the suspect receives appropriate clinical attention as soon as reasonably practicable (Code C, paras 9.5, 9.5A and Annexes G and H).

### Periods of Detention

#### Maximum Period

Section 41 provides that a person ‘shall not be kept in police detention for more than 24 hours without being charged’. This 24-hour period begins from the ‘relevant time’.

> [!defn] Relevant time
> 1. In the case of a person attending voluntarily at the police station who is then arrested at the police station, the time of his arrest (s 41(2)(c));
> 2. In the case of a person who attends a police station to answer ‘street bail’ granted under s 30A, the time when he arrives at the police station (s 41(2)(ca));
> 3. In any other case, the relevant time is the time when the suspect arrested arrives at the first police station to which he is taken after his arrest (s 41(1)(d)).

#### Extending Maximum Period

Under s 42, the police have the power to extend the period of a suspect’s detention in the  
police station up to a period of 36 hours from the ‘relevant time’ if an officer of superintendent or above has reasonable grounds for believing that:

1. Detention necessary to secure or preserve evidence relating to an offence for which the suspect is under arrest
2. The offence is an indictable offence (either way or indictable only); and
3. The investigation is being carried out diligently and expeditiously.

#### Further Extensions

The police are able to obtain a warrant of further detention from a magistrates’ court if the magistrate considers that there are ‘reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention of the person to whom the application relates is justified’ (s 43(1)). If the magistrates are persuaded to grant a warrant of further detention, this can be for such period of time as the magistrates think fit, but up to a maximum period of 36 hours.

In exceptional cases, the police may make an additional application to a magistrates’ court under s 44 for an extension of the warrant of further detention granted under s 43.

> [!note]
> The police can detain a suspect in police custody for a maximum period of four days before that suspect must be either released or charged.

#### Detention Reviews

The police are obliged to carry out periodic reviews of the suspect’s detention to ensure that the grounds on which the detention was initially authorised by the custody officer are still applicable (s 40). This is a mandatory requirement. If not done, any detention after this time is unlawful and amounts to the tort of false imprisonment ([[Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662]]). Reviews of detention that take place before a suspect is charged are carried out by an officer of at least the rank of inspector who is not directly involved in the investigation (s 40(2)(b)).

The first review must take place no later than six hours after **the custody officer first authorised the detention of the suspect.** Note this is not 6 hours after the relevant time.

## Rights of the Suspect

### Right to Have Someone Informed of the Arrest

> [!statute] s 56 - Right to have someone informed when arrested.
> (1) Where a person has been arrested and is being held in custody in a police station or other premises, he shall be entitled, if he so requests, to have one friend or relative or other person who is known to him or who is likely to take an interest in his welfare told, as soon as is practicable except to the extent that delay is permitted by this section, that he has been arrested and is being detained there. 
> 
> (2) Delay is only permitted—
> - (a) in the case of a person who is in police detention for an indictable offence ; and
> - (b) if an officer of at least the rank of inspector authorises it.
> 
> (3) In any case the person in custody must be permitted to exercise the right conferred by subsection (1) above within 36 hours from the relevant time, as defined in section 41(2) above.
> 
> (4) An officer may give an authorisation under subsection (2) above orally or in writing but, if he gives it orally, he shall confirm it in writing as soon as is practicable.
> 
> (5) An officer may only authorise delay where he has reasonable grounds for believing that telling the named person of the arrest—
> - (a) will lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with an indictable offence or interference with or physical injury to other persons; or
> - (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having committed such an offence but not yet arrested for it; or
> - (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such an offence.

### Right to Legal Advice

> [!statute] s 58(1)
> A person arrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor privately at any time.

Free, independent legal advice is available. Unless a suspect asks for legal advice to be paid for by himself, the police must contact the Defence Solicitor Call Centre (DSCC) – even if the suspect has asked for a named solicitor or firm. The DSCC will then determine whether the case is such that telephone advice is sufficient or whether a solicitor should attend.

- Telephone advice, where appropriate, is provided for free through Criminal Defence Direct (CDD).
- Should attendance be required, the suspect’s own solicitor, or the duty solicitor (if the suspect has not specified a particular solicitor), will be notified.
- If a solicitor attends the police station to see a particular suspect, that suspect must be informed of the solicitor’s arrival at the police station (whether or not he is being interviewed at the time of the solicitor’s arrival).
- At no time should a police officer do or say anything with the intention of dissuading a person from obtaining legal advice (Code C, para 6.4).
- No police officer or police staff shall indicate to any suspect, except to answer a direct question, that the period for which he is liable to be detained, or, if not detained, the time taken to complete the interview, might be reduced if he does not ask for legal advice or does not want a solicitor present when being interviewed (para 6ZA of the Notes for Guidance to Code C)

### Delaying Right to Legal Advice

The police have a very limited right to delay the exercise of this right. Any delay must be authorised by an officer with at least the rank of superintendent, and can be authorised only when a suspect has been arrested for an indictable offence (s 58(6)). The length of any delay can be for a maximum of 36 hours from the relevant time (s 58(5)).

A police officer may authorise a delay in the suspect receiving access to legal advice only if he  
has reasonable grounds for believing that the exercise of this right will:

1. Lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with an indictable offence, or interference with or physical injury to other persons.
2. Lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having committed an offence but not arrested
3. Hinder the recovery of property obtained as a result of such an offence (s 58(8)).

## Interviews and Identification Evidence

The investigating officer may:

- Carry out an audibly recorded interview with the suspect about the suspect's alleged involvement in the offence
- Carry out identification procedure to see if a witness/ victim is able to recognise the suspect
- Take fingerprints from the suspect
- Take samples from the suspect
- Take photos of the suspect.

### Interviews

Interviews are tape recorded, usually on two tapes. The master tape is sealed in the presence of the suspect at the end of the interview. The other tape is the working copy – used by the police to prepare a written summary or transcript of the interview. Some police forces produce a third tape for D's solicitor (if charged).

#### Appropriateness

Interviews should not be carried out when the suspect appears unable to (para 11.18(b), Code C)

1. Appreciate the significance of questions or answers
2. Understand what is happening because of intoxication/ illness.

### Start of the Interview

1. Caution
	- The police officer will caution the suspect.
	- Right to remain silence, though the court may draw adverse inferences from such silence.
	- A special caution will be given if the interviewing officer wants the suspect to account for an object/ substance/ mark found on his person/ in his possession.
	- If the special caution is given and the suspect then fails to answer the question (or to answer the question satisfactorily), the court at trial will be able to draw an adverse inference from this pursuant to ss 36–37 of the CJPOA 1994. Suspect must be informed
		- What offence is being investigated
		- What fact the suspect is being asked to account for
		- This fact may be due to the suspect taking part in the commission of the offence
		- A court may draw a proper inference if the suspect fails/ refused to account for the fact
		- Record of the interview may be given in evidence if the suspect if brought to trial.
	- Suspect reminded that he is entitled to free and independent legal advice.
2. Significant statements and silence
	- Must put to the suspect any significant statement or silence which occurred in the presence and hearing of a police officer before the start of the interview (Code C para 11.4)
	- Suspect asked to confirm/ deny the earlier statement/ silence, and if he has anything to add.
	- A ‘significant statement’ is a statement which appears capable of being used in evidence against the suspect at trial, in particular a direct admission of guilt.
	- A ‘significant silence’ is a failure or refusal to answer a question or to answer satisfactorily when under caution, which might allow the court to draw adverse inferences from that silence at trial.
	- Should the police officer fail to put to a suspect at the start of the interview a significant statement or silence made outside the police station, this may result in the contents of that statement or the nature of that silence being ruled inadmissible at trial under s 78 of PACE 1984

#### Conduct of Interview

Paragraph 11.5 Code C provides: ‘No interviewer may try to obtain answers or elicit a statement by the use of oppression.’ Oppression involves shouting, making threatening gestures, leaning over the suspect, standing over the suspect etc.

Paragraph 11.5 also states that ‘no interviewer shall indicate, except to answer a direct question, what action will be taken by the police if the person being questioned answers questions, makes a statement or refuses to do either’.

If interviews with a suspect take place over more than one day, in any period of 24 hours the suspect must be given a continuous period of at least eight hours for rest (usually at night) which is free from questioning or any other interruption (Code C para 12.2).

Breaks from interviews should take place at recognised meal times, and short refreshment breaks should be taken at approximately two-hour intervals (Code C, para 12.8).

#### Interview Before Legal Advice

Generally, a suspect who requires legal advice should not be interviewed until such advice has been received (Code C para 6.6).

Exceptions:

- s 58 allows the police to delay a suspect's receiving any legal advice for up to 36 hours. The police will usually want to interview the suspect in this period.
- If an officer of rank $\geq$ superintendent reasonably believes that the delay would be caused by the time taken to obtain legal advice would:
	- Lead to interference with/ harm to evidence
	- Interference with/ physical harm to other people
	- Serious loss of/ damage to property
	- Alerting other people suspected of having committed an offence but not arrested
	- Hinder the recovery of property obtained in consequence of the commission of an offence (Code C para 6.6(b)(i)).
- If the relevant solicitor has agreed to attend the police station, but awaiting their arrival would ‘cause unreasonable delay to the process of investigation’ (Code C, para 6.6(b)(ii))
- If the solicitor the suspect has asked to speak to either cannot be contacted or has declined to attend the police station, and the suspect has then declined the opportunity to consult the duty solicitor (Code C, para 6.6(c))
- If the solicitor asks for legal advice, changes his mind, and certain conditions are satisfied (about an inspector or higher speaking to the suspect and being satisfied that it proper for the interview to go ahead).

If there is no solicitor present when the suspect wants one, at the start of the interview, the suspect will be cautioned that ‘You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be given in evidence.’

> [!statute] s 58 Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999
> No adverse inferences may be drawn at trial from the suspect’s silence in interview if the suspect had not at the time of the interview been allowed access to legal advice.

## Charging Suspect

Once the suspect has been investigated, the custody officer has 4 options:

1. Release the suspect without charge and without bail
2. Release the suspect without charge but on bail whilst the police make further enquiries
3. Release the suspect without charge but on bail
4. Charge the suspect.

### Release without Charge and without Bail

Appropriate if the police determine that the suspect did not commit the crime under investigation, or there is insufficient evidence and unlikely that any further evidence will be obtained.

### Release on Bail While the Police Make Enquiries

The police can release the suspect on bail under s 47(3)(b) if there is insufficient evidence to charge the suspect and the police need to make further enquiries.

ss 52–67 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 have amended PACE 1984 and effectively introduced a presumption of release without bail where the police have no evidence upon which to charge.

The presumption does not apply if:

1. The case has been submitted to the CPS for a charging decision, or
2. The custody officer is satisfied that releasing the suspect on bail is necessary and proportionate in all the circumstances, and an officer $\geq$ inspector authorises the release on bail.

Where it is necessary and proportionate to bail the suspect, a maximum period of 28 days applies. This can be extended once up to 3 months (if $\geq$ superintendent authorises), or by the court for another 3 months in exceptional cases (PACE 1984, ss 47ZD–47ZG).

Where a suspect is released on bail, details of the time and date when the suspect needs to reattend the police station will be contained in a written notice which will be given to him by the police.

If the suspect fails to answer his bail at the police station, he may be arrested without warrant (s 46A). Although failing to answer bail at the police station is technically a criminal offence, it is very rare in practice for the police to charge a suspect with this offence.

The police may impose conditions on bail granted to a suspect whilst the police make further enquiries into the alleged offence (s 47(1A)).

### Release on Bail While CPS Investigates

s 37B of PACE 1984 provides that it is for the CPS to determine whether the suspect should be charged and, if so, with what offence. Once the police believe there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, the police will need to send the case papers to the CPS for it to determine the exact charge.

In more complex cases, the CPS may be unable to make an immediate decision on charge. It will take several weeks for the CPS to review a file, and the police will therefore need to release the suspect on bail under s 47(3)(b) whilst this is done.

The police may impose conditions on a suspect who is released on bail pending consultations with the CPS (s 47(1A)).

#### Threshold Test

If:

1. CPS lawyer believes it may not be appropriate to release a suspect on bail after charge, and
2. Insufficient evidence to apply the two-part test

the lawyer may apply the “Threshold Test”. Involves deciding whether there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed an offence, and whether it is in the public interest to charge D.

Full Test must be applied as soon as is practicable.

### Charging Procedure

Usual practice: police refer the case to CPS for it to determine the appropriate charge.

When a decision has been made to charge a suspect, the suspect will be formally charged at the police station. In accordance with para 16.2 of Code C, the suspect must be cautioned on charge and anything the suspect says in response to the charge should be written down.

> You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention now something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

The suspect should also be given a written notice ("charge sheet") giving the particulars of offence.

#### Further Interviews

After the charge, police cannot interview, except:

- To prevent or minimise harm
- To clear up ambiguity in a previous answer
- In the interest of justice for the suspect to have him comment on information concerning the offence coming to light since he was charged.

## Bail After Charge

### Denying Bail

Where a suspect is charged, the custody officer must decide whether to:

- Keep him in police custody before trial
- Release him on bail with or without conditions (s 38(1))

Bail can only be denied when (s 38(1)(a)):

- Name/ address given are doubted/ not given
- Custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that:
	- He will fail to appear in court to answer bail
	- Necessary to prevent him committing an offence
	- Necessary to obtain a sample
	- Necessary to prevent him causing physical injury/ loss or damage to property
	- Necessary to prevent him from interfering with administration of justice/ investigation.
	- Necessary for his own protection.

### Conditional Bail

If the custody officer decides to grant bail to a suspect who has been charged, he must then decide whether it is necessary to impose conditions on that bail (PACE 1984, s 47(1A)). Conditions must be necessary.

The custody officer cannot impose a condition that a suspect reside at a bail hostel, undergo medical examination or see his legal adviser.

Usual conditions are:

1. to reside at a particular address;
2. not to speak to or contact any witnesses;
3. not to enter a particular area or set of premises; or
4. to observe a curfew at night between specified hours.

If a suspect wants these conditions varied, he can:

1. Ask the custody officer to vary the conditions (Bail Act 1976, s 3A(4))
2. Make an application to the magistrates' court for the conditions to be varied (Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, s 43(B)(1) and CrimPR, r 14.6).

### First Court Appearance

| Bail scenario                        | Court appearance                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suspect granted police bail          | First sitting of the court, unless the court is too busy. Likely to be 1-2 weeks.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Suspect denied police bail           | Not later than the first sitting of the court after he is charged with the offence (s 46(2)). Normally within 24 hours.                                                                                                            |
| Breaching police bail (after charge) | s 7(3) Bail Act 1976: police officer can arrest person if he believes the person is unlikely to surrender to custody or the person has breached/ likely to breach bail. Must be brought before magistrates' court within 24 hours. |

## Alternatives to Charging

Alternatives include:

1. An informal warning
2. A penalty notice
3. A formal caution
4. A conditional caution.

### Informal Warnings

In minor cases, the police have always had discretion to release a suspect without charge but to give him an informal warning about his future conduct.

### Penalty Notices

The police may issue a penalty notice to dispose of minor offences without the need for the offender to go to court:

- Fixed Penalty Notice for minor road traffic offences/ littering/ dog fouling
	- Not a criminal conviction.
- Penalty Notices for Disorder for anti-social behaviour like being drunk and disorderly.
	- Requires paying a fine
	- An offender can dispute the notice in the magistrates' court
- s 132 of LASPO 2012 allows for the issuing of penalty notices with an education option on persons aged over 18, in areas where educational course schemes have been established.

### Simple Cautions

Instead of giving an informal warning, the police (in conjunction with the CPS) may instead  
decide to issue a simple caution. A record of the caution is kept, and may be mentioned in court when determining sentencing for a future offence.

Given in a police station by an officer $\geq$ inspector. Conditions:

1. sufficient evidence must have been collected to have justified a prosecution;
2. there must be clear and reliable evidence of a voluntary admission by the offender that he has committed the offence;
3. the offender must agree to being cautioned, having been made aware that the caution might be raised in court were he to be convicted of a later offence.

Section 17(2) of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 restricts the use of simple cautions for indictable-only offences to those where a police officer $\geq$ superintendent determines there are exceptional circumstances relating to D or the offence.

| Type of offence         | Caution available?                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Summary                 | Yes                                                                                                                      |
| Either way offence      | s 17(3) Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015: no unless $\geq$ inspector determines there are exceptional circumstances. |
| Indictable only offence | s 17(2) CJCA 2015: no unless $\geq$ superintendent determines there are exceptional circumstances and CPS agrees.                                                                                                                        |

s 17(4) CJCA 2015 restricts the use of simple cautions for repeat offending.

### Conditional Cautions

- Manifestation of “restorative justice”.
- Do not replace the police caution system
- Must only be used with the approval of the CPS.
- s 22 CJA 2003: can be given to a person aged $\geq 18$, provided s 23 requirements are satisfied. Conditions must have the objective of:
	- Facilitating rehabilitation of the offender
	- Ensuring reparation is made for the offence
	- Punishing the offender.

Conditions:

- there must be evidence that the offender has committed an offence;
- relevant prosecutor or an authorised person must determine that there is sufficient evidence to charge the offender with the offence
- the offender must admit that he committed the offence;
- the effect of the conditional caution must be explained to the offender along with a warning for non-compliance
- the offender must sign a document containing the details of the offence, an admission that he committed the offence, his consent to a conditional caution and the conditions attached to the caution (CJA 2003, s 23).

If an offender fails "without reasonable excuse" to comply with any conditions, may be arrested and prosecuted for the original offence (s 25 CJA 2003). The conditions that are likely to be attached to cautions will be geared either towards rehabilitating the offender, or towards the offender making reparation to his victim.

### Disadvantages

1. A caution is a formal recorded admission of guilt which will stay on the offender's record
2. The client will almost certainly lose the opportunity to receive a caution subsequently
3. Existence of the caution disclosable on certain job applications (particularly professional ones).
4. If the offence is sexual, the client will be placed on the sex offenders register
5. Police may retain fingerprints and other identification.

A client should accept a caution only if he accepts his guilt and there is sufficient evidence against him. If there is insufficient evidence, the CPS may choose not to prosecute.

## Commencing a Case without Charge

For minor summary only offences, a suspect may not have been arrested by the police and may not even have needed to attend the police station. A prosecutor can send the person a “written charge” of the offence (s 29(1) CJA 2003). The prosecutor must also send the person charged a document called a ‘requisition’ or single justice procedure notice, requiring that the person appear before a magistrates’ court at a given time and place (CJA 2003, s 29(2)).

## Complaints About Police

Can formally complain to the relevant police force. The police force will decide whether to record the complaint. If recorded, the police force may refer complaints to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). If not referred, it will be dealt with either by local resolution or local investigation. There is a right of appeal against a police decision not to record the complaint or the outcome of a local resolution/ investigation.

In serious cases of police misconduct, the CPS may start criminal proceedings.

# Solicitor at Police Station

A suspect who has been arrested and detained at the police station is entitled to free legal  
advice and to be represented by a solicitor (PACE 1984, s 58).

The solicitor’s only role in the police station is to protect and advance the legal rights of their client. On occasions, this may require the solicitor to give advice which has the effect of the client avoiding giving evidence which strengthens the prosecution case.

## Preparations

### Phone Contact

The solicitor will usually be telephoned by the Defence Solicitor Call Centre (DSCC) to say that a suspect who has been arrested wants the solicitor to attend the police station to represent him.

After speaking to the DSCC, the solicitor should speak to the client. The solicitor will need to identify themselves (if they have not represented the client on a previous occasion), ask the client to confirm that he wants the solicitor to come to the police station to represent him, and remind the client that any advice given will be free. The client should be advised to confine themselves to “yes/ no” answers to questions, in case the police can overhear.

### When

A solicitor is not obliged to attend the police station immediately after the initial telephone contact, even if the client has insisted that the solicitor attends straight away (e.g., if the police notify the solicitor that they will not interview until the client has sobered up).

The solicitor must attend if:

1. The offence is serious
2. The police intend to interview/ investigate straight away
3. The client is vulnerable (e.g., child)
4. Client complains of police mistreatment
5. Solicitor needs to make representations about the client's detention
6. Client needs to speak to solicitor in confidence.

Solicitor should check the law and check old files.

## Information Gathering

### Custody Officer

- Should allow the solicitor to view the custody record and detention log.
- Custody log should be used to obtain client's basic details and confirm other details (about the offence and practicalities).
- Code C, para 2.4A allows a legal representative or an appropriate adult to request a copy of the custody record when a detainee leaves police detention or is taken before a court.

### Investigating Officer

Solicitor should speak to the investigating officer to obtain:

- Facts of the case
- Disclosure
- Significant statements and/or silences
- Next steps.

### Disclosure

The police are not obliged to provide the solicitor with evidence, but will usually provide some of the details they have. Common today for the police to supply the solicitor with a disclosure statement summarising the evidence which the police have.

If the investigating officer refuses to make any disclosure, or discloses only a very limited amount of information, the solicitor should point out to him that in those circumstances the solicitor cannot properly advise the client as to the nature of the case against him and will only be able to advise the client to give a ‘no comment’ interview.

> [!statute] para 11.1A, Code C
> Before a person is interviewed, they and, if they are represented, their solicitor must be given sufficient information to enable them to understand the nature of any such offence, and why they are suspected of committing it.

### Significant statements/ Silences

Check whether there have been any.

### Next Steps

Solicitor must find out from the investigating officer what his intentions are. Ask the investigating officer about their views on bail.

### Client

The solicitor should speak to the client once they have obtained as much information as possible. They should discuss:

- The solicitor's identity and role
- Details of the alleged offence
- Client's instructions
- Next step in police investigation (usually an audibly recorded interview)
- Prepare the client for interview
	- Advising them whether or not to answer questions
	- Preparing a written statement on the client's behalf if the client is to give a 'no comment' interview
	- Advise the client on how the interview will be conducted.
	- Advise the client on the role the solicitor will play in the interview.

### Conduct

A solicitor may take instructions from a client who confirms that he has in fact committed the offence for which he has been arrested, but who wants to deny the offence when interviewed by the police. But the solicitor cannot attend the interview to represent the client if the client intends to deny having committed the offence (para 1.4 SRA Code, duty not to mislead the court).

If the client insists on giving false information in interview, the solicitor should decline to act any further on the client’s behalf.

### Conflict of Interest

A solicitor will often be asked to advise two (or more) individuals at the police station who are jointly suspected of having committed an offence. It is the responsibility of the  
solicitor to determine whether a conflict of interest exists.

Then speak to suspect 1. If their account suggests a conflict of interest, the solicitor should decline to act for the second suspect. If a conflict of interest emerges only after the solicitor has seen both suspects, the appropriate course of action is usually for the solicitor to withdraw from the case completely (unless they can act for S1 without breaching duty of confidentiality to S2).

If representing both suspects, they should not disclose anything between suspects unless:

1. Obtained the other client's consent in writing
2. Both clients are advancing the same defence
3. They consider it in the clients' interest for the information to be disclosed.

And always have regard to the overriding duty not to mislead the court.

> [!important]
> Co-accused who are represented by the same solicitor may attempt to use that solicitor to pass information between each other so that they can jointly fabricate a defence and give the police a consistent ‘story’. To guard against this, the solicitor should ensure that before telling the second client what they have been told by the first client, they obtain an account of the second client’s version of events.

### Disclosure to TP

A solicitor representing a client at the police station may be asked for details of their client’s defence by another solicitor representing a co-accused who has been arrested in connection with the same matter. Such a request should be treated with caution.

### Withdraw From Acting

If withdrawing for professional reasons, the solicitor should:

1. Explain to the client why they cannot represent him
2. Tell the client he is entitled to free legal advice from another solicitor of his choice or the duty solicitor
3. Tell the client that the solicitor owes the client an ongoing duty of confidentiality
4. Tell the custody officer that they are no longer able to act.

## Should the Suspect Answer Questions

The reason for the police wanting to interview a suspect is their hope that the suspect will ‘crack’ and say something incriminating when put under the pressure of an interview situation.

Client has 4 options:

1. To answer all questions
2. To give a no comment interview
3. Selective silence
4. No comment interview but hand a written statement to the police setting out the facts relied upon in defence at trial.

| Option               | Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Answer questions     | Client can put the record straight. Police may decide not to pursue the case further. Credibility of evidence at trial boosted if story consistent from the start. If admitting guilt, answering questions at the interview may help police to deal with the matter using a caution.                                    | Suspect may say something incriminating/ make comments undermining credibility. Transcript of the interview will be read out at court if the suspect is charged and pleads non-guilty. Consider whether the police have sufficiently disclosed evidence. A common tactic is putting a new piece of information to the suspect in the interview. Client may attack the character of another, which may enable to CPS to raise in evidence any previous convictions the client may have. |
| No comment interview | No danger of incrimination. Useful tactic if the police have little evidence - client likely to be released without charge.                                                                                                                                                                                             | If the client is charged and pleads not guilty, the magistrate or jury may draw adverse inference. If client fails to answer questions in police interview and raises a new defence at trial, the court/ jury are entitled to conclude that the defence is a sham.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Preparing Client for Interview

Explain to the client:

1. Interview will be audibly recorded and parties asked to identify themselves
2. Interview may be stopped at any time if the client requires further legal advice.
3. Solicitor will be present in the interview to protect the client's interest
4. If the client is to remain silent, should say "no comment" for each question asked
5. Police will use tactics:
	1. Asking innocuous questions
	2. Suggest legal advice received is incorrect
	3. Warn him that consequences will arise unless questions are answered.
6. Client should not lose their cool
7. Client should not make personal attacks on others during the interview.

## Charge and Bail After Charge

- If it seems there is insufficient evidence to charge, the solicitor should draw this to the attention of the investigating and custody officer.
- If there is sufficient evidence, consider making representations to the police that the client should be dealt with in other ways
	- e.g., informal warning, penalty notice, simple or conditional caution.
- If the custody officer indicates that she is minded to refuse bail, the suspect’s solicitor should consider making representations in support of bail being granted.

## Police Station Representative Accreditation Scheme

A suspect who is detained at the police station may receive legal advice from a solicitor or an accredited police station representative.

The aim of the Police Station Representative Accreditation Scheme is to certify non-solicitors to advise and assist suspects being held at a police station, and to allow them to claim payment from the LAA for having provided such assistance.

Possible to become accredited as a trainee solicitor.

# Inferences From Silence

## Right to Silence

Suspects have a right to remain silent when interviewed at the police station. Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (CJPOA) 1994, when a defendant’s case comes to trial, the court may be permitted to draw what are termed ‘adverse inferences’ from his earlier silence when being questioned about the offence.

Possible inferences:

1. Recent fabrication: the defendant remained silent when interviewed by the police because he had no adequate explanation for his conduct.
2. Lack of confidence in defence: suspect did not believe that defence would stand up to further investigation by the police.

A defendant’s silence when interviewed by the police cannot on its own prove guilt (CJPOA 1994, s 38(3)).

The court is not permitted to draw an adverse inference from a defendant’s silence if that silence occurred at a time when the defendant had not been allowed the opportunity to consult a solicitor to obtain independent legal advice (Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, s 58).

## S 34 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994

> [!statute] s 34 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994
> (1) Where, in any proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the accused—
> - (a) at any time before he was charged with the offence, on being questioned under caution by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom the offence had been committed, failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings; or
> - (b) on being charged with the offence or officially informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such fact,
> - (c) at any time after being charged with the offence, on being questioned under section 22 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (post-charge questioning), failed to mention any such fact,
> 
> being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed... the court or jury... may draw such inferencese from the failure as appear proper. 

The terms of s 34 may be satisfied even where a defendant has answered every question put to him, if at trial he raises some other fact in his defence that he did not mention, but could reasonably have been expected to mention, when interviewed.

## Conditions

Before adverse inferences could be drawn from a defendant’s silence in police interview, conditions in [[R v Argent [1997] 2 Cr App R 27]] must be satisfied:

1. the interview had to be an interview under caution;
2. the defendant had to fail to mention any fact later relied on in his defence at trial;
3. the failure to mention this fact had to occur before the defendant was charged;
4. the questioning of the defendant at the interview in which the defendant failed to mention the fact had to be directed to trying to discover whether or by whom the alleged offence had been committed; and
5. the fact which the defendant failed to mention had to be a fact which, in the circumstances existing at the time, the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention when questioned.

A jury should be directed that an adverse inference from a defendant’s silence could be drawn only if the court was satisfied that the real reason for the defendant’s silence was that he had no answer to the questions that were being put to him, or no answer that would stand up to scrutiny ([[Condron v UK (2001) 31 EHRR 1]]).

If a defendant remained silent during his initial interview at the police station and then answered questions during a subsequent interview, inferences from his failure to answer questions in the first interview might still be drawn at trial ([[R v Betts and Hall [2001] 2 Cr App R 257]]).

If a defendant places his factual defence on record when interviewed by the police, a court will not draw an adverse inference if he says nothing when he is subsequently charged (s s 34(1)(b) is not really used in practice).

### Directions to Jury

Jury are told to make the inference only if they think it a fair and proper conclusion, and they are satisfied that:

- When interviewed, D could reasonably have been expected to mention the facts on which he now relies on in his defence at trial;
- The only sensible explanation is he had no answer at the time or none that would stand up to scrutiny; and
- Apart from the failure to mention facts, the prosecution's case against him is so strong that it clearly calls for an answer.

## Use of Written Statement

Allows the client’s version of events to be set out in a clear and logical way. If there is “staged” disclosure of evidence in the interview by the police, the solicitor may stop the interview to prepare further written statements on D's behalf.

The purpose of s 34 was to encourage defendants to make an early disclosure of their defence to the police, not to permit the police to scrutinise and test that defence in interview ([[R v Knight [2003] EWCA Crim 1977]]). So D is free to answer “no comment” to everything after handing in a written statement.

When a defence solicitor prepares a written statement for their client but does not hand this in to the police , whilst this will prevent the court at trial from drawing the inference of recent fabrication, it will not prevent the court from drawing an inference that the defendant was not sufficiently confident about his defence to expose this to investigation by the police following the interview.

## Advising Silence

Solicitor may advise the client to remain silent:

- If the police have not given sufficient disclosure
- If the nature of the case is particularly complex/ relates to events occurring a long time ago
- Personal circumstances of the suspect.

> [!test] Advising silence adverse inference
> Staying silent at a police interview under legal advice does not automatically prevent the court drawing an adverse inference. But the fact that D was advised not to answer questions in the police station must be given appropriate weight at trial ([[Condron v UK [2000] Crim LR 679]]). In this case, the court will ask whether the facts relied on in trial were facts which the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention in police interview. The jury will now be directed by the trial judge that adverse inferences should not be drawn under s 34 if the jury believe that the defendant genuinely and reasonably relied on the legal advice to remain silent.

## Legal Privilege

At trial, a defendant may give evidence which has the effect of waiving privilege and allowing the prosecution to cross-examine him about reasons for the legal advice that he was given.

- If D gives evidence that he remained silent in interview following advice from solicitor, this will not waive privilege.
- If an adverse inference is to be avoided, the court is likely to want to know the reasons for the solicitor’s advice.
- Once a defendant gives this information, privilege is waived ([[R v Bowden [1999] 1 WLR 823]]).
- So can be cross-examined as to the reason for the solicitor's decision to advise him to remain silent.

> [!action] Big brain strategy
> - When giving evidence-in-chief, D says nothing about the reason for his silence when interviewed
> - Prosecution during cross-examination allege D fabricated his defence. 
> - D tells court that he disclosed his defence to the solicitor whilst at the police station, but the solicitor advised him to remain silent for other reasons. 
> - D will not waive privilege ([[R v Loizou [2006] EWCA Crim 1719]])

In the absence of a waiver of privilege by a defendant, no questions could be asked which would in effect require the defendant to waive his privilege or be criticised for not doing so ([[R v Seaton [2010] EWCA Crim 1980]]).

> [!action] Big brain strategy 2
> Many solicitors who advise a client to remain silent in interview now give such advice on tape at the start of the interview:
> > I now advise you to remain silent because … [the disclosure given by the police is so limited that I cannot properly advise you/I do not consider you to be in a fit state to be interviewed/the offences you are alleged to have committed occurred so long ago or are so complex that you cannot be expected to give an immediate response, etc].

This does not amount to a waiver of privilege because the advice is being given to the client there and then.

Where a solicitor, in the presence of their client, gives a statement that they had advised their client not to comment during police interviews and provides the particular reason for doing so, privilege will be waived on the basis that the solicitor is acting as the client’s agent ([[R v Hall-Chung [2007] All ER (D) 429 (Jul)]]).
