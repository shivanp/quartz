# Johnson v Youden [1950] 1 KB 544

FACTS: A builder committed an offence by selling a house for £250 more than the maximum permitted under a statutory regulation. The £250 was paid to him in advance by the purchaser. The builder then instructed a firm of solicitors to act for him in the sale. Two of the partners in the firm had no knowledge of the earlier payment, but they were convicted by the magistrates of aiding and abetting the builder’s offence.

HELD: Their convictions were quashed by the Divisional Court because they had no knowledge of the facts which gave the transaction its criminal character. They therefore lacked the _mens rea_ to be guilty as accessories.

A person cannot be convicted of aiding and abetting the commission of an offence if he does not know of the essential matters which would constitute the offence. A builder had a licence from a local authority to build a house with a condition attached to it under the Building Materials and Housing Act 1945 s.7(1), limiting the price for which the house might be sold to GBP 1,025. He induced a purchaser to agree to buy the house for GBP 1,275, and he instructed a firm of solicitors, in which the three respondents were partners, to act as his solicitors for the sale. The builder was charged with an offence against s.7(1) of the 1945 Act and was convicted, but the three respondents were acquitted on charges of aiding and abetting him. The first two respondents did not, at any time, know anything about the extra GBP 250. The third respondent, however, was informed before completion by the purchaser's solicitor of a breach of s.7 of the 1945 Act, and was told by the builder that he had placed the extra GBP 250 in a separate deposit account and that it was to be spent on payment for work as and when he would be lawfully able to execute it in the future on the house on behalf of the purchaser. Held, on appeal, the justices had been right in dismissing the information against the first two respondents; the third respondent, however, if he had read and appreciated the words of s.7(5) of the Act would have seen at once that the extra GBP 250 which the builder was getting was in respect of a "transaction with which the sale [was] associated" within the meaning of that subsection, and was, therefore, an unlawful payment; he, therefore clearly had aided and abetted the builder in the offence which the builder had committed.
