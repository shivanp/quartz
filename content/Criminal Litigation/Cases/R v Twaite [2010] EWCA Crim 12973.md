# R v Twaite [2010] EWCA Crim 12973

The appellant (T) appealed against his conviction, by a majority decision at a court martial, for committing a civil offence contrary to the [Air Force Act 1955 s.70](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I72A67220E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c7ca249c25814c71a726814a588298b8&contextData=(sc.Search)), namely fraud by false representation contrary to the [Fraud Act 2006 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA5E42E00753611DB8071C6D7F7AFDBBF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c7ca249c25814c71a726814a588298b8&contextData=(sc.Search)).

T had applied for service family accommodation on the basis of his impending marriage on August 29, 2008. The application was granted and he began living in service family residence with his fiancee on August 27, 2008 but he did not in fact marry until August 29, 2009. Throughout that 12-month period he did not inform the relevant authorities that the marriage had not taken place. The Crown alleged that T had made a false representation in his application form and that his subsequent representations were dishonest. The judge advocate drafted questions for the board which returned a majority verdict of guilt. On sentencing, the judge advocate asked the board how many agreed with the verdict. She then retired with the board to consider sentence. Following those discussions the judge advocate became concerned that the board had convicted T on a false premise: on the basis that his criminality arose on or after August 29, 2008 when he failed to inform the authorities that he had not married, which was an offence under [s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID484FC80754511DB8071C6D7F7AFDBBF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c7ca249c25814c71a726814a588298b8&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the 2006 Act which had not been included as an alternative count. She then purportedly exercised her powers under the Armed Forces Court Martial Rules 2009 r.25 and terminated the proceedings. The case was referred to the Judge Advocate General.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) There was no reason to conclude that a finding of guilt on a basis of a simple majority was inherently unsafe or that there was an increased danger that it might be unsafe if, after conviction, the defendant might be sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment (see para.[29](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) It was wrong in principle for any request to be made of a board which identified an acquittal by a majority or required it to record voting figures when a defendant was acquitted. There were no circumstances in which the way the individual members of the board voted should be revealed. There was no requirement in the Judge Advocate General's guidance issued in November 2009 to ask the board how many agreed or dissented with a majority verdict (paras [31-34](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The judge advocate had no power under the 2009 Rules to terminate the hearing. The verdict had been reached. Accordingly she was functus officio. T was convicted by a majority verdict and only the Court of Appeal had the power to set that verdict aside. On an examination of the history of the case, it was clear that T was convicted by the board on the basis of post-August 29, 2008 dishonesty. The question posed for the board on that issue was equivocal and not apt to cover post-August 29, 2008 dishonesty. Accordingly the conviction had to be quashed. A retrial was not ordered (paras [36-39](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
