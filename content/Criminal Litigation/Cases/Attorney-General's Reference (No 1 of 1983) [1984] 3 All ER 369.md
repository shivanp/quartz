# Attorney-General's Reference (No 1 of 1983) [1984] 3 All ER 369

FACTS: The defendant, a policewoman, was mistakenly overpaid Â£74.74 for overtime that she had not worked, and the money was credited to her bank account. At the original trial, the judge misdirected the jury to acquit the defendant, therefore the prosecution appealed to the Court of Appeal on a point of law.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that although ownership of the money had passed to the defendant, from the moment she became aware that the mistake had been made, she was under a legal obligation to restore the money she had received by mistake. Consequently, by virtue of the **section 5(4)** for the purposes of the **Theft Act 1968**, the money would be regarded as belonging to the police authority.

Subject to proof of an appropriation and of dishonesty, a person does not repay to her employer money mistakenly credited to her bank account may be guilty of theft. R was a woman police constable; by reason of a mistake for which she was neither directly nor indirectly responsible a sum of GBP 74.74 was credited to her bank account in respect of overtime she had not, in fact, worked. R knew nothing until later of the erroneous credit and the police made no demand for repayment. R was charged with theft. At her trial there was some evidence that she knew of the mistake and had decided to take no action. Throughout it was assumed that her account was in credit. The trial judge stopped the case at the close of the prosecution evidence.

Held, that subject to the Crown proving dishonesty and that there had been an appropriation the necessary ingredients for theft were there:

(i) the debt due to R from her bank was a chose in action and therefore capable of being stolen;

(ii) as R had clearly got the money by way of another's mistake she had been under an obligation to restore it as provided in the [Theft Act 1968](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60709470E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=03ff8d30107944b89a16ccf5141c1ddd&contextData=(sc.Default)) s.5(4);

(iii) the chose in action was property belonging to the police as soon as R realised that it was in her bank account; (iv) satisfactory proof that R had no intention of making restoration to the police would be proof of an intention permanently to deprive ( _[R. v Davenport (Laurence Henry Christopher) [1954] 1 W.L.R. 569, [1954] 2 WLUK 96](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3F15D0B0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=03ff8d30107944b89a16ccf5141c1ddd&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, _[R. v Kohn (David James) (1979) 69 Cr.
