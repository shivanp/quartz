# Du Cross v Lambourne [1907] 1 KB 40

If D’s car was being driven at a dangerous speed by E in D’s presence, D could be convicted, for he was in control, could and ought to have prevented her from driving in a dangerous manner.

The appellant appealed against his conviction for unlawfully driving his car at a speed dangerous to the public. During the hearing, there was a conflict of evidence as to whether the car was being driven by the appellant or by a lady seated by his side in the car when the accident happened. The court dismissed his appeal without deciding whether the appellant was driving the car. It found that if the lady was driving, she was doing so with the consent and approval of the appellant who could have known that the speed was dangerous. The King’s Bench Division held that a person who aided and abetted the commission of an offence punishable on summary conviction might, under s 5 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1848, be convicted upon an information which charged him with having committed the offence as principal offender. Accordingly, his conviction would stand.
