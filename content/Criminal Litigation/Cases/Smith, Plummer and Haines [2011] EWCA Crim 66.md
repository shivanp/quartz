# Smith, Plummer and Haines [2011] EWCA Crim 66

## Summary

Class A drugs which were unlawfully in a complainant's possession constituted property which could be appropriated for the purposes of the [Theft Act 1968](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60709470E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9da7c74d3dbb4b41b4f84296e34c5d42&contextData=(sc.Default)).

## Abstract

The appellants (S, H and P) appealed against their convictions for robbery and, alternatively, against their sentences of eight years' imprisonment.

The victim (V) was a drug dealer. S had asked V to meet him to supply him with heroin worth Â£50. When V arrived, P and H attacked him, putting a knife to his throat and forcing him to hand over the heroin. They dragged him to the ground where they punched, kicked and stamped upon him. S, H and P all had numerous convictions for similar offences. Their pre-sentence reports noted that their patterns of offending were dominated by acquisitive behaviour intended to provide funds for the purchase of drugs although it was clear that the instant offence represented an escalation in the seriousness of their offending and was in that sense beyond the pattern of their previous offending. The judge acknowledged the aggravation of the offence by planning and was concerned about the use of a knife and of shod feet. He did not accept that the seriousness of the offence was mitigated by the fact that a small amount of drugs was involved or the fact that the theft was of a substance unlawfully in V's possession.

S, H and P submitted that

(1) prohibited drugs unlawfully in a complainant's possession did not constitute property for the purposes of the [Theft Act 1968](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60709470E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9da7c74d3dbb4b41b4f84296e34c5d42&contextData=(sc.Default)) meaning that there could have been no appropriation;

(2) the judge had taken too high a starting point in sentencing them and the robbery should have been regarded as within level two of the Sentencing Guidelines Council's definitive guidelines for robbery.

## Held

Appeals allowed in part.

(1) [Section 4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF66DE90E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9da7c74d3dbb4b41b4f84296e34c5d42&contextData=(sc.Default)) of the Act identified a number of items which might otherwise appear to be property but which could not be stolen. Those exclusions did not extend to property of which someone was in prohibited or unlawful possession. Save where expressly excluded, therefore, the definition of "property" covered all property which included drugs, _[R. v Turner (Frank Richard) (No.2) [1971] 1 W.L.R. 901, [1971] 3 WLUK 97](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6E911E80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9da7c74d3dbb4b41b4f84296e34c5d42&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Kelly (Anthony Noel) [1999] Q.B. 621, [1998] 5 WLUK 211](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I50E74710E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9da7c74d3dbb4b41b4f84296e34c5d42&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. It was not appropriate to consider the impact of civil law concepts on the law of theft. As suggested in Smith's Law of Theft (9th edn, October 18, 2007, David Ormerod and David Huw Williams), public policy which prevented the wrongdoer from enforcing a property right should have no application to criminal proceedings because the criminal law was concerned with keeping the Queen's peace, not vindicating individual property rights. Accordingly, the appropriation of the drugs constituted theft even though the complainant had been in unlawful possession of prohibited Class A drugs (see paras [6-12](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The judge had rightly been concerned at a street robbery which involved the use of a knife and the use of shod feet while kicking V on the ground. He had also been correct not to accept as a mitigating feature the fact that the amount of drugs involved was relatively small or that the offence was minimised because the theft had been of a substance unlawfully in V's possession. The offences should be approached as within level two of the definitive guideline on robbery, with significant aggravating features. The sentences would therefore be reduced from eight years' imprisonment to seven years' imprisonment, to bring them within the top end of that bracket (paras [23-26](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
