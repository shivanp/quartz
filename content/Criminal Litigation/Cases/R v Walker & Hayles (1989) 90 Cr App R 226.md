Foresight of death was something from which a jury could infer an intent to kill. W and H were involved in a fight with J, during which they threatened to kill him and dropped him from a third floor balcony. On a charge of attempted murder the trial judge directed the jury that they were entitled to infer an intention to kill if they were sure that W and H knew that there was "a very high degree of probability" that J would be killed.

Held, dismissing the appeal against conviction, that the judge had properly directed the jury that foresight of death was something from which they could infer an intention to kill. The words "virtual certainty" would have been a better phrase, but the difference, if any, between that and a "very high degree of probability" was not such as to render the conviction unsafe, _[R. v Hancock (Reginald Dean) [1986] A.C. 455, [1986] 2 WLUK 298](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I489B4110E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bb9dc35a658140b883b0a1426ffbc4c8&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[R. v Nedrick (Ransford Delroy) [1986] 1 W.L.R. 1025, [1986] 7 WLUK 116](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5B43B681E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bb9dc35a658140b883b0a1426ffbc4c8&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied.
