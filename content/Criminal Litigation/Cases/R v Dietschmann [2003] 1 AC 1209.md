# R v Dietschmann [2003] 1 AC 1209

## Summary

Where a person accused of murder pleads diminished responsibility but was intoxicated at the time of the killing, the questions for the jury are whether, notwithstanding the consumption of alcohol and its effects upon the defendant, he would have killed as he did and would have been under diminished responsibility when he did so.

## Abstract

D appealed against a decision (_[R. v Dietschmann (Anthony) [2001] EWCA Crim 2052, [2002] Crim. L.R. 132](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3FA4CA40E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8832fd77fad84d738032942417242977&contextData=(sc.Default))_) upholding his conviction for murder.

D killed a man whilst under the influence of alcohol. D believed his victim had insulted his aunt, with whom D had been very close. At trial, psychiatrists for both parties agreed that D was suffering from an abnormality of mind which manifested itself as a delayed grief reaction, or adjustment disorder, following the death of his aunt. At the close of the trial the judge directed the jury that the defence of diminished responsibility would be made out if they believed that if D had not consumed alcohol he would still have killed and would have been under diminished responsibility when he did so.

D submitted that a defence of diminished responsibility did not require D to prove that had he not have consumed alcohol he would still have killed and would have been under diminished responsibility when he did so.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

A defence of diminished responsibility did not require a defendant to prove that had he not have consumed alcohol he would still have killed, _[R. v Gittens (Charlesworth Alexander) [1984] Q.B. 698, [1984] 6 WLUK 80](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I47507190E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8832fd77fad84d738032942417242977&contextData=(sc.Default))_.

The drink did not supervene over D's underlying sub-normality, _[R. v Atkinson (John) [1985] Crim. L.R. 314, [1985] 3 WLUK 4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I82B52F10E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8832fd77fad84d738032942417242977&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[R. v Egan (Shaun Daniel) [1992] 4 All E.R. 470, [1992] 5 WLUK 135](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I42DFF811E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8832fd77fad84d738032942417242977&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[R. v Turnbull (Launcelot George) (1977) 65 Cr. App. R. 242, [1977] 1 WLUK 786](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6E8CD8C0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8832fd77fad84d738032942417242977&contextData=(sc.Default))_. The underlying condition remained and so did the question whether that condition substantially impaired Dâ€™s responsibility for the killing. _[R. v Fenton (Martin Charles) (1975) 61 Cr. App. R. 261, [1975] 7 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I43788E90E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8832fd77fad84d738032942417242977&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[R. v Tandy (Linda Mary) [1989] 1 W.L.R. 350, [1987] 12 WLUK 282](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6DB404F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8832fd77fad84d738032942417242977&contextData=(sc.Default))_.

Accordingly the case was remitted back to the Court of Appeal to decide whether to allow the appeal and quash the conviction of murder and order a new trial or to substitute a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.
