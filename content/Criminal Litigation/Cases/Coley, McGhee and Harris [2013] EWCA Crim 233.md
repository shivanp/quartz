# Coley, McGhee and Harris [2013] EWCA Crim 233

The Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, provided guidance on the interplay between the law relating to voluntary intoxication and the law relating to insanity or (non-insane) automatism in three cases where the defendants had, amongst other things, appealed against convictions for various offences to which they had raised insanity and/or automatism as a defence.
