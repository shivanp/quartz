# Edwards v Ddin [1976] 1 WLR 942

By virtue of the [Sale of Goods Act 1893 s. 18](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1DCEB7405E8711E4941FC98B5DA68C38/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=813c68836a0a42e0b3acde05190ff598&contextData=(sc.Default)) the property in petrol passes when it is pumped into the tank of a customer's car and he commits no offence under the [Theft Act 1968 s. 1 (1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60709470E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=813c68836a0a42e0b3acde05190ff598&contextData=(sc.Default)) by subsequently driving away without paying. D drove his car into a garage and requested the attendant to fill up the tank with petrol and put in a quart of oil. After the attendant had done so D drove off without paying. He was charged with theft. The justices found that when D drove away the property in the goods had passed to him, therefore he was not appropriating property belonging to another within s. 1 (1) of the 1968 Act and dismissed the case. The prosecutor appealed.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the delivery of the petrol and oil was an unconditional appropriation of the goods to the contract within s.18 of the 1893 Act since the vendor did not retain a right of disposal; thus the property in the goods passed to D when they were placed in his car.
