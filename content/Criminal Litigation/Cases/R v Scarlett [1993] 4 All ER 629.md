# R v Scarlett [1993] 4 All ER 629

The defendant was the landlord of a pub. He believed the deceased was about to hit him and therefore the defendant physically removed him from the premises. The deceased fell down some steps and suffered a head injury from which he died. The Court of Appeal held that if the defendant was using reasonable force in acting in self-defence or to prevent a crime, there would be no unlawful assault and accordingly the defendant's conviction for unlawful act manslaughter was quashed.
