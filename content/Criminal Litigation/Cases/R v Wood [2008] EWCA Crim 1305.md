# R v Wood [2008] EWCA Crim 1305

## Summary

At the murder trial of a defendant who suffered from alcohol dependency syndrome the judge had misdirected the jury when addressing a verdict of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility as he had implied that unless the jury were of the opinion that every drink consumed by the defendant was involuntary his alcohol dependency syndrome had to be disregarded.

## Abstract

The appellant (W) appealed against his conviction for murder.

W, who was an excessive drinker, went to the flat of the victim (V) after consuming large amounts of alcohol during the day. It was W's case that he fell asleep and was woken by V attempting to perform oral sex on him. W repeatedly struck V with a meat cleaver, killing him. At trial it was agreed by four psychiatrists called to give evidence that at the time of the killing W suffered from alcohol dependency syndrome. The judge directed the jury in relation to drunkenness and diminished responsibility and said a verdict of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility was only open to the jury if W's consumption of alcohol was truly involuntary. He further stated that giving into a craving was not an involuntary act and an alcoholic not suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms who chose to accept a drink after he reached his normal quota was not drinking involuntarily.

W contended that the judge had misdirected the jury by directing them that a defendant who succumbed to a craving for alcohol was acting voluntarily. W contended that whether he was acting voluntarily would depend on the strength of the craving and his capacity to address and overcome it.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) In the context of diminished responsibility alcoholism was now regarded as a disease that might fall within the ambit of the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c629f54df6444974a328dc972a21d26e&contextData=(sc.Default)), _[R. v Dietschmann (Anthony) [2001] EWCA Crim 2052, [2002] Crim. L.R. 132, [2001] 10 WLUK 170](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3FA4CA40E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c629f54df6444974a328dc972a21d26e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The House of Lords decision in _[R. v Dietschmann (Anthony) [2003] UKHL 10, [2003] 1 A.C. 1209, [2003] 2 WLUK 908](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3FA4F150E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c629f54df6444974a328dc972a21d26e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ had not altered the principle that, on its own, voluntary consumption of alcohol, however excessive, did not constitute an abnormality of the mind, Dietschmann (2003) applied. However, the House of Lords decision established that the defence of diminished responsibility within s.2 of the Act was not precluded by the mere fact that a defendant had consumed alcohol voluntarily before committing the fatal act. The decision in Dietschmann (2003) required a re-assessment of the way in which _[R. v Tandy (Linda Mary) [1989] 1 W.L.R. 350, [1987] 12 WLUK 282](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6DB404F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c629f54df6444974a328dc972a21d26e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was applied in the context of alcohol dependency syndrome where observable brain damage had not occurred, Tandy doubted. The distinction drawn in R v Tandy between cases where brain damage had occurred as a result of alcohol dependency syndrome and those where it had not was no longer appropriate.

(2) When the judge directed the jury that giving into a craving was not an involuntary act he implied that there was no such thing as an irrisistible craving. That might have been regarded as a direction to conclude that any consumption of alcohol by W as a result of a craving did not or could not give rise to a defence of diminished responsibility. He added that choosing to accept a drink after reaching his normal quota was not drinking involuntarily which, in effect, directed the jury to accept that such a choice was voluntary even when made by an alcoholic. The directions given implied that unless every drink consumed that day by W was involuntary his alcohol dependency syndrome had to be disregarded. Accordingly the conviction for murder was quashed.
