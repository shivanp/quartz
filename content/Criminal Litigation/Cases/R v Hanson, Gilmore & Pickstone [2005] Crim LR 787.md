# R v Hanson, Gilmore & Pickstone [2005] Crim LR 787

## Summary

The court gave guidelines on the admissibility in criminal prosecutions of evidence of a defendant's bad character, in particular evidence of a defendant's previous convictions, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

## Abstract

The applicants applied for leave to appeal against their convictions in unrelated cases. In each case evidence of an applicant's previous convictions had been admitted pursuant to the [Criminal Justice Act 2003](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5F97C0A0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d74049e503ac408ea71aa00205c043d5&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, refusing the applications, that

(1) under the [Criminal Justice Act 2003 s.103(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID71527B0E45211DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d74049e503ac408ea71aa00205c043d5&contextData=(sc.Default)) a defendant's propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he was charged could be established by evidence of conviction of an offence of the same description or category as the one with which he was charged, but by the [Criminal Justice Act 2003 s.103(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID71527B0E45211DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d74049e503ac408ea71aa00205c043d5&contextData=(sc.Default)) that did not apply if the court was satisfied that that would be unjust by reason of the length of time since the conviction or for any other reason. Where propensity to commit an offence was relied upon, there were essentially three questions to be considered:

(i) whether the history of convictions established a propensity to commit offences of the kind charged;  
(ii) whether that propensity made it more likely that the defendant committed the offence charged;  
(iii) whether it was unjust to rely on the convictions of the same description or category and, in any event, whether the proceedings would be unfair if they were admitted. In referring to offences of the same category s.103(2) was not exhaustive of the types of conviction which might be relied upon to show evidence of propensity to commit offences of the kind with which a defendant was charged.

Whilst a single previous conviction for an offence of the same description or category would not often show propensity, it could do so where it showed a tendency to unusual behaviour or where its circumstances demonstrated probative force in relation to the offence charged. Comparatively clear examples of unusual behaviour were sexual abuse of children or fire setting. When considering what was just under s.103(3) and the fairness of proceedings under s.101(3) a judge could take into consideration the degree of similarity between the previous conviction and the offence charged. However striking similarity did not have to be shown before convictions became admissible.

(2) In any case in which evidence of bad character was admitted to show propensity, whether to commit offences or be untruthful, the judge in summing up should clearly warn the jury against placing undue reliance on previous convictions. In particular the jury should be directed that they should not conclude that a defendant was guilty or untruthful merely because he had the convictions adduced. In addition the jury should be directed that although it was entitled to take propensity, if found shown, into account when determining guilt, propensity was only one relevant factor and they should assess its significance in the light of all other evidence in the case.

(3) Where a judge had directed himself correctly, the Court of Appeal would be very slow to interfere with a ruling either as to admissibility or as to the consequences of non compliance with the regulations for the giving of notice of intention to rely on bad character evidence. It would not interfere unless the judges judgment as to the capacity of prior events to establish propensity was plainly wrong or discretion had been exercised unreasonably in a Wednesbury sense. Furthermore if, following a ruling that evidence of bad character was admissible, a defendant pleaded guilty, it was highly unlikely that an appeal against conviction would be entertained.
