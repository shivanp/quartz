# R v Vickers [1957] 2 QB 664

## Abstract

The [Homicide Act 1957s.1(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60953370E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=39c667ee1e8140fe8bee56c929181e5d&contextData=(sc.Default)) , provides:

> "Where a person kills another in the course or furtherance of some other offence, the killing shall not amount to murder unless done with the same malice aforethought (express or implied) as is required for a killing to amount to murder when not done in the course or furtherance of another offence."

Per Lord Goddard C.J.:

> "â€¦the section preserves implied malice as well as express malice and the words where a person kills another in the course or furtherance of some other offence' cannot, in our opinion, be referred to the infliction of the grievous bodily harm if the case which is made against the accused is that he killed a person by having assaulted the person with intent to do grievous bodily harm, and from the bodily harm he inflicted that person dies. The furtherance of some other offence must refer to the offence he was committing or endeavouring to commit other than the killing, otherwise there would be no sense in it."

The appellant broke into a house with the intention of committing a burglary and was found by the owner, an elderly woman. In order to prevent recognition he struck her many blows and she died. The appellant was convicted of capital murder. He appealed on the ground that by the Homicide Act 1957 s.1(1), "constructive malice" had been abolished, and as the death occurred in the course of causing grievous bodily harm, the necessary malice aforethought to establish murder could not be implied from that, and he was not guilty of murder but of manslaughter.

Held, dismissing the appeal, in addition to the felony of burglary, the appellant intended to cause grievous bodily harm and the necessary malice aforethought could be inferred from that intention.

FACTS: In **_Vickers_**, the defendant broke into a shop intending to steal from it. He was disturbed by the elderly lady who lived above the shop. Vickers struck her and kicked her in the face, as a result of which she died. Vickers was convicted of murder. He appealed against his conviction on the grounds that the **Homicide Act 1957** had removed an intention to cause grievous bodily harm as a head of _mens rea_ for murder. The defence argued that, if Vickers intended to cause her grievous bodily harm, he was committing an offence under the **Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 18**, i.e. another offence and therefore, under the **Homicide Act, s1**, the offence of murder had to be disregarded.

HELD: This argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which confirmed the _mens rea_ of murder as intention to kill or intention to cause grievous bodily harm
