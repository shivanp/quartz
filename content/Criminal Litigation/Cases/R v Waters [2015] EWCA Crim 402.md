# R v Waters [2015] EWCA Crim 402

FACTS: A group of people who knew one another met in a park. W took a mobile phone from V and said he would not return it until she had persuaded a young person called Dale to come and talk to them. The trial judge had told the jury that if W had told V she would only get her mobile back on the fulfilment of a condition, this would constitute an intention to permanently deprive.

HELD: In overturning the conviction, the Court of Appeal said that if the condition as to an itemâ€™s return can readily be fulfilled and may be fulfilled in the near future, the jury may well conclude that an intention to permanently deprive had not been made out.

## Summary

A judge had been wrong to direct a jury that in order to have an intention to permanently deprive, for the purposes of the [Theft Act 1968 s.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=30a841301a8548cb908e6cabc77a4d7e&contextData=(sc.Default)), the person taking the property had to intend that the owner should permanently lose the item, or would only get it back if it was paid for in some way, either in money or by the performance of some action in return. If a condition attached to the return of an item could readily be fulfilled and might be fulfilled in the near future, the jury might well conclude that intention to permanently deprive had not been made out.

## Abstract

The appellant (W) appealed against his conviction for robbery.

W had been involved in a confrontation between a group of young people. He had taken a mobile phone and some cigarettes from the complainant. He asked the complainant for the phone's password and the complainant told him. There was evidence that W had claimed that the phone would be returned if another young person (H) was persuaded to come and speak to him and his group. The judge directed the jury in relation to the [Theft Act 1968 s.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=30a841301a8548cb908e6cabc77a4d7e&contextData=(sc.Default)). He indicated that the person taking the property had to intend that the owner should permanently lose the item, or would only get it back if it was paid for in some way, either in money or by the performance of some action in return. The issue was whether the judge had directed the jury properly in relation to the element of the offence of theft in s.6, which required an intention to permanently deprive the other of the property.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

The judge had clearly directed the jury that if W made it plain that the phone would be returned if he was able to talk to H, that would constitute an intention to permanently deprive. That was not a correct statement of the law. If the condition attached to the return of the item was one which would not be fulfilled or would not be fulfilled in the foreseeable future, then the circumstances might well amount to an intention permanently to deprive. However, if the condition could readily be fulfilled and might be fulfilled in the near future, the jury might well conclude that intention to permanently deprive had not been made out, _[R. v Coffey [1987] Crim. L.R. 498, [1987] 1 WLUK 1002](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I85507360E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=30a841301a8548cb908e6cabc77a4d7e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. In the instant case, the judge had not dealt in satisfactory detail with the impact of s.6 on the circumstances of the case. In view of the direction which had been given, the jury might have thought that even if H could be found in the near future and it was therefore likely that the phone would rapidly be returned to its owner, there was nevertheless an intention to permanently deprive the owner of the phone. That would not be a correct conclusion. There was a real possibility that if the jury had been properly directed on that matter, they would have acquitted W. His conviction would be quashed (see paras [16-20](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).
