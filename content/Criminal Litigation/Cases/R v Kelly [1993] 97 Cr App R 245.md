# R v Kelly [1993] 97 Cr App R 245

FACTS: K used a screwdriver to break into a house. When surprised by the householder, K told him to unplug the video and then stabbed the householder with the screwdriver. On leaving, K was arrested with a video in one hand and the screwdriver in the other.

HELD: His appeal against conviction for aggravated burglary was dismissed. The court said that K was charged on the basis of the **Theft Act 1968, s 9(1)(b).** Therefore, the time at which K had to be proved to have had a weapon of offence, in order to be guilty of aggravated burglary, was at the time that he actually stole. The screwdriver would become a weapon of offence when K intended to use it for causing injury to, or incapacitating, any person. He had this intent by the time of the theft. This construction followed from the clear language of the **Theft Act 1968, s 10** and was consistent with its purpose.

The relevant time for considering whether the defendant had an offensive weapon with him with intent to cause injury is the time of the actual theft. K broke into a house using a screwdriver and stole a video. When stopped by police outside the house he was found in possession of the video and the screwdriver. He was charged with aggravated burglary. An occupant of the house claimed that K had jabbed him with the screwdriver. K claimed he had stolen the video before the occupants appeared and that he had not shown the screwdriver to them. He was convicted of aggravated burglary and appealed on the ground that to be guilty of aggravated burglary the Crown had to prove that he had the weapon with him intending to cause injury before the need to use the weapon arose.

The [Theft Act 1968 s.10(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6B4B61E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e56face119254dea924f04e166bd5850&contextData=(sc.Default)) states "a person is guilty of aggravated burglary if he commits any burglary and at the time has with him any firearm or imitation firearm, any weapon of offenceâ€¦. and for this purpose (b) "weapon of offence' means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury".

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the relevant time for consideration of K's intent to use the weapon is at the time of the actual theft. Use of the screwdriver at the time of the theft established the requisite intent, namely the intent to injure if the need arose (_[R. v Olaleye (Jimmy) (1986) 82 Cr. App. R. 337, [1986] 1 WLUK 831](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FA11D30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e56face119254dea924f04e166bd5850&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
