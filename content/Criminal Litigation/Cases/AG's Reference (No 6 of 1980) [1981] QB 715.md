# AG's Reference (No 6 of 1980) [1981] QB 715

Two boys decided to settle an argument by a fight and one sustained a bleeding nose and bruises. It was held that the other was guilty under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA 1861) s 47 of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH).

The public interest requires that consent should not be a defence to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The respondent and another youth quarrelled in a public street, where they agreed to, and did have, a fist fight. One was injured. The defendant was acquitted after the judge directed the jury that if the other party consented and the force used was reasonable, the defendant was not guilty. On a reference on the question of whether consent could be a defence to a fight in a public place, held, that public interest required that it could not, whether the offence was committed in a public or a private place.
