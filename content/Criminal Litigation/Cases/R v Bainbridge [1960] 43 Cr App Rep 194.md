# R v Bainbridge [1960] 43 Cr App Rep 194

The appellant bought oxygen cutting equipment used by thieves for breaking into a bank. He was charged with being an accessory before the fact of office-breaking, the case against him being that he had bought the cutting equipment on behalf of the thieves with full knowledge that it was to be used for breaking and entering premises. He admitted that he suspected that the equipment was required for something illegal but he denied having any knowledge that the equipment would be used for any such purpose. It was contended that for the appellant to be convicted as an accessory before the fact, it had to be shown that he knew that the cutting equipment was to be used for breaking into the particular bank on the particular date. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that it was not necessary to prove that the appellant knew the date on which the felony was to be committed or the particular premises which were to be broken and entered.
