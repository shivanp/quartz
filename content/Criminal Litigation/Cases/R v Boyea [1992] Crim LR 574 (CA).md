# R v Boyea [1992] Crim LR 574 (CA)

FACTS: The defendant inserted his fist into the victim's vagina during lovemaking. The defendant claimed that he did not intend to cause the level of harm sustained and that it was done for the purpose of sexual gratification.

HELD: Consent was not allowed as a defence.

B was convicted of indecent assault. He had caused injuries to the complainant by inserting his hand into her vagina. The judge directed the jury that consent was irrelevant if B's actions were likely or intended to cause bodily harm.

Held, dismissing B's appeal, that the direction was correct. An assault intended or which was likely to cause bodily harm, accompanied by indecency, was an offence irrespective of consent, provided that the injury was not "transient or trifling". The phrase "transient or trifling" must be understood in the light of prevailing conditions and social attitudes (_[R. v Donovan (John George) [1934] 2 K.B. 498, [1934] 7 WLUK 52](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I423E87F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8bd0457fe1ae4e228cc58bc7a3aada30&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Attorney General's Reference (No.6 of 1980) [1981] Q.B. 715, [1981] 5 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6A7C00E1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8bd0457fe1ae4e228cc58bc7a3aada30&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
