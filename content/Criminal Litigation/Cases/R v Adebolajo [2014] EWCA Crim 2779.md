# R v Adebolajo [2014] EWCA Crim 2779

FACTS: Two men killed Fusilier Lee Rigby on a Woolwich street because he was in the British army. They stated that they were fighting a war so were not under the Queen’s Peace.

HELD: Lord Thomas CJ, said:

> 'The law is now clear. An offender can generally be tried for murder wherever committed if he is a British subject, or, if not a British subject, the murder was committed within England and Wales. The reference to “the Queen's peace”, as originally dealt with in the cases to which we have referred, went essentially to jurisdiction.’
