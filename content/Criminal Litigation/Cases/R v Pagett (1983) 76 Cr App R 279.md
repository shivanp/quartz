# R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr App R 279

FACTS: Using his pregnant girlfriend as a shield, Pagett shot at the police, who were attempting to arrest him for various serious offences. The police returned fire and killed the girl. The judge, directing the jurors on causation, stated that they had to be sure that the appellant had fired first at the officers and that that act caused the officers to fire back, with the result that the girl was killed. The jury also had to be satisfied that, in doing so, the police acted reasonably, either by way of self-defence or in the performance of their duties as police officers. The judge said that if they were not sure of those facts, then they should acquit because the chain of causation, linking Pagett's unlawful acts to the girl's death, would be broken. The jury convicted Pagett, who appealed against his conviction.

HELD: The Court of Appeal rejected the appeal and held that there may only be a break in the chain of causation if the actions of the third party were 'free, deliberate and informed. This was not held to be the case here.' Goff LJ was of the opinion that the police officers' actions were neither free nor deliberate. Instead, he considered it to be a reasonable act performed for the purpose of self-preservation.

## Abstract

In homicide cases it is rarely necessary for the judge to give the jury any direction on causation as such. The judge must direct the jury as to the general principles of law relating to causation and then leave it for them, in the light of those principles, to decide whether or not the relevant causal link has been established.

D, who was armed with a shotgun and cartridges, shot at police officers who were trying to arrest him for various offences. He had with him a 16-year-old girl who was pregnant by him and against her will used her body to shield him from any retaliation by the officers. He fired shots, and the officers returned his fire and the girl was killed. D was charged with her murder. He was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter. The judge had directed the jury that a person would be guilty of manslaughter if he intentionally did an act which was dangerous and unlawful and as such caused the death of another person. Thus in the instant case, they could convict if they were satisfied, so as to be sure, that the two unlawful acts, the assault on the police officers by firing at them and the assault on the girl by forcing her to shield his body, were acts which sober and reasonable persons would inevitably recognise would subject the girl to the risk of some harm. D appealed on the ground that the judge should have left it for the jury to determine whether his act in firing at the police officers was a substantial, or operative, or imputable cause of the death of the deceased.

Held, dismissing his appeal, that it was for the judge to direct the jury with reference to the relevant principles of law relating to causation and then leave it for the jury to decide, in the light of those principles, whether or not the relevant causal link had been established.

In homicide cases it was rarely necessary to give the jury any direction on causation as such; even where it was necessary, it was usually enough to direct them that the accused's act need not be the sole cause or even the main cause of the victim's death, it being enough that the act contributed significantly to the result (_[R. v Pitts 174 E.R. 509, [1842] 3 WLUK 84](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BCF4BC0E57511DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3f6719bf3ab44509af7e59fa9f726dd1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Curley (James) (Leave to Appeal) (1909) 2 Cr. App. R. 96, [1909] 3 WLUK 104](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C23D460E57511DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3f6719bf3ab44509af7e59fa9f726dd1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).

Occasionally a specific issue of causation might arise, as, for example, where the intervention of a third person might be regarded as the sole cause of the victim's death (or novus actus interveniens). A reasonable act performed for the purpose of selfpreservation, including a reasonable act of self-defence, does not operate as a novus actus interveniens an act done in the execution of a legal duty. In the present case, the jury must have found that D did two unlawful and dangerous acts, i.e. firing at the police and using the girl in self-defence as a shield when the police might well fire shots in his direction. Either act could, if on the above principles it resulted in the death of the girl, constitute the actus reus of manslaughter, and therefore no legitimate criticism could be made of the direction given by the trial judge on the issue of causation.
