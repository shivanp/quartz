# R v Dawson and James (1977) 64 Cr App R 170, CA

FACTS: One man nudged the victim while another took his wallet.

HELD: Their conviction for robbery was upheld because the Court of Appeal rejected their argument that their actions did not amount to force. The word used in the statute was force, not violence. The court held that as force is an ordinary word, which juries can be expected to understand, it is a matter for them whether force on a person had been used.

Whether or not "force" has been used in an alleged robbery is a question for the jury; resort need not be had to old authorities where the wording of the statute is clear and simple. The appellants were convicted of robbery. The victim gave evidence that he had been nudged and pushed off-balance and that while he was trying to keep his balance his wallet had been stolen. It was submitted on the appellants' behalf that what was alleged did not amount to "force" within the meaning of s. 8 (1) of the Act.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the question as to whether, on the evidence, force had been used to further theft, had properly been left to the jury.
