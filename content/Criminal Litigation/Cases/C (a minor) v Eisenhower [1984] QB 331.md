# C (a minor) v Eisenhower [1984] QB 331

For the purposes of the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b36664c22b7d45c484143514d24f58cd&contextData=(sc.Default)) a "wound" means a break in the continuity of the whole skin. The justices had found D guilty of maliciously wounding a person within the meaning of s.20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 where he had fired an air pistol which had hit his victim in the eye but merely caused an internal rupturing of blood vessels and not a break in the skin. His appeal against conviction was allowed on appeal by way of case stated. A break in the continuity of the whole skin was required. (The test in _[R. v Wood (William) and McMahon (James) 168 E.R. 1271, [1830] 1 WLUK 2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID35F49601D8711DC81EE86361337D9EA/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b36664c22b7d45c484143514d24f58cd&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was applied; _[R. v McLoughlin 173 E.R. 651, [1838] 8 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB0F03B90E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b36664c22b7d45c484143514d24f58cd&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was applied; _[R. v Shadbolt 172 E.R. 1073, [1833] 4 WLUK 9](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB0F062A0E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b36664c22b7d45c484143514d24f58cd&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was applied and _R. v Waltham (1849) 3 Cox C.C. 442, [1849] 1 WLUK 1_ was applied; _[R. v Warman 169 E.R. 203, [1846] 1 WLUK 2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB0F01480E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b36664c22b7d45c484143514d24f58cd&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was distinguished).
