# R v Gullefer [1990] 3 All ER 82

D backed a greyhound to win a race. Once the race had started, it became clear that the greyhound would not win; D therefore ran on to the track to distract the dogs, in the hope that the stewards would declare "no race," and the bookmakers would then have to return all stakes. He was charged with attempting under s.1(1), (4) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 to steal his stake.

Held, that it could not be said of D that in jumping on to the track he was in the process of committing theft. There was no evidence that in so doing he had got beyond the stage of mere preparation (_[R. v Ilyas (Mohammed) (1984) 78 Cr.
