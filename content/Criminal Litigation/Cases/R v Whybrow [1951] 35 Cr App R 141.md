# R v Whybrow [1951] 35 Cr App R 141

The Court of Criminal Appeal (Lord Goddard, C.J., Hilbery, Finnemore, Slade and Devlin, JJ.) pointed out the distinction between the directions to be given to the jury in a case of murder, on the one hand, and of attempted murder on the other: when a person was charged with murder the charge to the jury was that, if the victim had died as the result of an attack which was meant to kill him or cause him grievous bodily harm, the assailant was guilty of murder as the intention to cause grievous bodily harm satisfied the requirement that in murder cases there must be malice aforethought; but where the indictment alleged attempted murder, the intent to murder became the principal ingredient in the crime. Accordingly it was a misdirection, where a man was charged with the attempted murder of his wife by electrocuting her in her bath, to tell the jury that they must find the prisoner guilty of attempted murder if they were of opinion that his intention was either to cause the death of his wife or to inflict grievous bodily harm on her.
