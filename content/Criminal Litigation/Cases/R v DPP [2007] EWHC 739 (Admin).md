# R v DPP [2007] EWHC 739 (Admin)

## Summary

A judge had been fully entitled to conclude that the appellants had been guilty of robbery notwithstanding that the victim had not felt threatened or in fear as it was the intention of the offender, not the fortitude of the victim, which determined whether a robbery had been committed.

## Abstract

The appellant young offenders (B and R) appealed by way of case stated against their convictions for robbery.

W, a 16-year-old boy, came out of a railway station and was stopped by five boys and asked if he had a mobile phone or some money. He replied that he did not. As he was being asked for a second time, five or six more males ran over to join the group. They surrounded W and took a drink from his pocket and a packet of crisps from his hands. B took hold of W's arms as he searched his pockets and took a wallet, a watch and a travel card from his pockets. Money was taken from the wallet, which was then thrown on the ground. R stood directly in front of W as this took place. Police officers in a nearby car saw W being pulled and pushed around by the group of males. As the police approached, the group scattered. B and R were arrested and W's watch was found in R's pocket. At the trial W said that he did not feel threatened or scared but was a bit shocked. The district judge rejected a submission of no case to answer and convicted B and R. She posed the following questions for the court's opinion:

(i) whether on a charge of robbery where a victim gave evidence that he did not feel threatened or in fear, and that the only touching was his pockets being searched, a tribunal was entitled to make a finding that there was a case to answer, and of guilt;

(ii) whether she had erred in directing herself in law that there had been an implied threat of force and that such a threat was sufficient to reject a submission of no case to answer and to subsequently make a finding of guilt.

B and R submitted that the offence had been no more than a distraction theft given that no actual force was involved. W had not been frightened and accordingly the district judge had erred in reaching the conclusions that she had.

## Held

Appeals dismissed.

(1) The district judge had been fully entitled to reject a submission of no case to answer and find that B and R were guilty of robbery. It was a question of fact for the tribunal whether in a particular case sufficient force was used to warrant a conviction for robbery. Arguments as to fine distinctions of fact should not be elevated into points of law. The fact that the victim did not feel threatened, or in fear, in no way required a conclusion that the assailant had not sought to put him in fear, otherwise the bravery of the victim would determine the guilt of an assailant, Grant v Crown Prosecution Service unreported doubted. It was the intention of the perpetrator, rather than the fortitude of the victim, which was the touchstone of whether the offence was robbery or theft.

(2) A threat of force could be express or implied, by either words or conduct. On the facts of the instant case there was every reason to conclude that there had been an implied threat of force.

(3) The submissions made by B and R were devoid of substance. The suggested unreasonable findings of fact had been no more than questions of fact which had been sought to be presented as questions of law. There had been no suggestion in the case stated that the conclusion of the district judge had been perverse. Her findings had not been contradictory. The incident had involved W being surrounded, so giving rise to some implied threat of force and some limited use of force in the pushing and shoving. She had been fully entitled to conclude that there had been a robbery and that B and R had been guilty of it.
