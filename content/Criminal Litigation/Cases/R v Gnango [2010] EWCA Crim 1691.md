# R v Gnango [2010] EWCA Crim 1691

N.B. negative judicial consideration

## Summary

Absent a shared purpose to shoot and to be shot at it could not be said that two opponents in a public gunfight shared a common purpose to commit affray. Although it was foreseeable that someone other than the gunmen might be killed, one was not guilty by way of joint enterprise of the murder of a bystander committed by the other during the gunfight.

## Abstract

The appellant young offender (G) appealed against his conviction for murder and against the sentences imposed for attempted murder and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.

When aged 17 years old G had engaged in an exchange of gunfire with an opponent (X) in a public place. One of X's shots killed a passerby. By the law of transferred malice there was no doubt that X was guilty of murder. G was convicted of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, attempted murder and, by way of joint enterprise, the murder of the passerby. The Crown had contended that the gunfight between G and X was a joint enterprise to commit the crime of affray, and that each foresaw that the other might kill someone other than the immediate target. The judge ruled that it was sufficient to amount to joint enterprise that G and X each committed the offence of affray, and it did not matter that they had opposing or antagonistic intentions in shooting at each other. G was sentenced to detention for public protection with respective minimum terms of 5 years, 12 years and 15 years for the firearm offence, attempted murder and murder.

G submitted that the Crown's case and the judge's direction involved a significant extension of the principles of joint enterprise. He argued that joint participation in the affray was not enough without more to establish joint enterprise, but that it was essential that there be a shared or common outcome. He also contended that foreseeability of the killing alone was not enough to prove liability and that it had to be foresight of something done in the course of joint enterprise.

## Held

Appeal allowed in part.

(1) The existence of a joint enterprise was essential to liability. Simple participation in the affray with foresight but without joint enterprise did not found liability. Although foresight of the act was the determining factor, on its own it was not enough and there had to be foresight of the further offence as a possible incident of the common enterprise and participation with that foresight in the common enterprise, _[Chan Wing Siu v R. [1985] A.C. 168, [1984] 6 WLUK 182](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I85B6AD10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50945dfd1cd94abebd13494585fca9b5&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Hui Chi-Ming v Queen, The [1992] 1 A.C. 34, [1991] 8 WLUK 11](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC48D1A10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50945dfd1cd94abebd13494585fca9b5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and McAuliffe v the Queen [1995] HCA 37 considered. In the instant case G and X were not in a joint enterprise. Although it was accepted that they were both guilty of affray, it was necessary to show that they agreed to that offence and shared a common purpose in committing it, _[R. v NW [2010] EWCA Crim 404, [2010] 1 W.L.R. 1426, [2010] 3 WLUK 94](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I535C4B10273D11DF9070F913FB9E6351/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50945dfd1cd94abebd13494585fca9b5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The ruling that it made no difference whether G's and X's interests were antagonistic meant that the jury was left free to conclude that the affray was enough to constitute a common purpose that both men intended to fight one another. Two people who voluntarily engaged in fighting each other could be acting together or in concert but ordinarily they were not, and the usual purpose of each antagonist was to strike the other but to avoid being struck himself. Absent a shared purpose to shoot and be shot at, it could not be said that G and X shared a common purpose. The jury was never asked to confront the question whether the shared common purpose was not only to shoot but to be shot at. Accordingly, the conviction for murder was to be quashed. (2) Under the [Criminal Appeal Act 1968 s.4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID4A12600E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50945dfd1cd94abebd13494585fca9b5&contextData=(sc.Default)) it was appropriate to replace G's sentence for attempted murder with a sentence of detention for public protection with a minimum term of 15 years. G's moral culpability was exactly the same whether he had committed attempted murder or murder, and likewise the harm that was the actual and foreseen consequence of his crime was the same, whichever his offence. In those circumstances, the sentence for attempted murder ought to have been in the same range as would have been a sentence for murder.
