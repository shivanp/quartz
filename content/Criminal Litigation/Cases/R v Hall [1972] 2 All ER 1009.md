# R v Hall [1972] 2 All ER 1009

FACTS: The defendant, a travel agent, took money for flights. Instead of using the money to buy airline tickets, he put it into the business account and it was used to pay off his creditors. Subsequently, the defendant went bankrupt and the customers lost the money they had paid to him.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that **section 5(3)** did not apply because it was not established that his clients expected him to retain and deal with the money in a particular way, or that an obligation to do so was undertaken by him. Although the clients expected tickets in return for their money, they did not expect their money to be kept separately, but rather to go towards the general running of the business.

A travel agent who takes deposits and payments from clients for trips which do not materialise, and who fails to refund the money is not guilty of theft in the absence of any special arrangement imposing on him an obligation to retain and deal with the money in a particular way within the [Theft Act 1968 s.5(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6753C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f1103a40516748b1937d938945ab2444&contextData=(sc.Default)). H, a travel agent, took deposits and payments for air trips to America from various clients. The trips did not materialise, and the money, which had been paid into the firm's general account, was not refunded.

Held, although H might be in breach of his contractual obligations, there was no evidence of any special arrangement imposing an obligation to retain and deal with the money in a particular way, and H was not guilty of theft. Dictum of Widgery, J. in _[R. v Yule (Thomas Christopher) [1964] 1 Q.B. 5, [1963] 5 WLUK 119](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I74AE0F80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f1103a40516748b1937d938945ab2444&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
