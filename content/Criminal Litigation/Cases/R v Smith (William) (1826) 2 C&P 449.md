# R v Smith (William) (1826) 2 C&P 449

The English Court held that there was no legal obligation on one brother to maintain another, so as to make the omission indictable. If one had his idiot brother, who was helpless, as an inmate in his house, and omitted to supply him with proper food, warmth, he was not indictable for the omission.
