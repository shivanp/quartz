# R v Watson [1989] 2 All ER 865

FACTS: In **_Watson_**, the defendants broke into the house of an elderly and frail man. The elderly man confronted the defendants and died of a heart attack shortly after the burglary. The defendants appealed against their conviction for manslaughter on the basis that when they entered the house they did not know that the elderly man was present and consequently the reasonable person would not know this. As a result, their act of burglary was not dangerous.

Reference was made by Lord Lane CJ to the explanation of how a burglary could cause death to someone with heart disease:

‘Dr West, who was called on behalf of the prosecution, had performed the autopsy. He was sure that the burglary was the cause of death. He described for the benefit of the jury how excitement causes the production of adrenalin making the heart beat faster. The heart therefore needs more blood and oxygen, but is unable to obtain it if there is a chronic heart disease, as there was here, with the result that the arteries leading to the heart are substantially narrowed. The heart then begins to beat irregularly, it eventually stops beating and thus death ensues.’

HELD: The Court of Appeal stated that a reasonable person in the defendant's shoes would have realised the act was dangerous once they became aware of the particular circumstances. It did not matter that the defendants did not know this information (frail, elderly man) when they first entered the house. The unlawful act comprised the whole of the burglarious intrusion during which time they were gathering knowledge and information about the victim.

Hence, following this rationale in **_Watson_**, the action of burglary became dangerous once they realised the elderly man was in the house. A reasonable person would consider that there was the risk of some harm being caused to an elderly and frail man.

The unlawful act of burglary does not end with the offender crossing the threshold of the premises, so that if in the course of the burglary he becomes aware of the presence of a person of particular vulnerability, and the fact of his presence causes that person's death, he may be guilty of manslaughter. W and another burgled M's flat, during the course of which they abused him verbally, but not physically. M in fact, but unknown to W and his accomplice, had a bad heart condition: he died 90 minutes after their visit.

Held, that the unlawful act which was the burglary continued after the actual entry into the premises. A sober and reasonable bystander would have realised M's vulnerability at once, so that if his death resulted from an act which such a bystander would have regarded as dangerous, that was manslaughter. Having regard, however, to the precise nature of a further direction to the jury the appeal would be allowed.
