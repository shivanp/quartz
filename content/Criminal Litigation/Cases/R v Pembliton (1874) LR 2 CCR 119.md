# R v Pembliton (1874) LR 2 CCR 119

FACTS: The accused threw a stone at a crowd of people. He missed them but broke a glass window behind them. It was found that he intended to hit the people but not the window. Had he injured someone, he could have been convicted under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 20.

HELD: The court quashed his conviction for criminal damage since that was an offence with a different _mens rea_. To be liable for criminal damage, the accused must have intended to damage property or been reckless to the same. An intention to injure a person was insufficient. Therefore, transferred malice will not assist where the defendant has the _mens rea_ for one crime and the _actus reus_ for another. The defendant must have the _mens rea_ for the crime charged. It is not possible to mix and match the _mens rea_ of different crimes.
