# DPP v Newbury and Jones [1977] AC 500

The offence of manslaughter is made out if it is proved that the accused intentionally did an unlawful and dangerous act (whether or not he knew it to be unlawful or dangerous) from which death inadvertently resulted. The appellants standing on the parapet of a railway bridge pushed part of a paving stone off the parapet and into the path of an approaching train. The stone broke through the glass of the train cab and struck and killed the guard sitting therein. After conviction for manslaughter the appellants appealed unsuccessfully to the Court of Appeal contending that the trial judge had misdirected the jury by failing to direct them that they could convict only if satisfied that the appellants had foreseen that harm might result to someone in consequence of their act.

Held, dismissing the further appeal, that it was unnecessary to prove such foresight on the part of the accused; that an objective test must be applied to the question as to whether an accused's unlawful act, from which death results, was dangerous.
