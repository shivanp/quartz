# R v Owino [1996] 2 Cr App R 128

O appealed against conviction of assaulting his wife occasioning actual bodily harm. His case was that the injuries were caused by his use of reasonable force to restrain her from assaulting him. The jury received no direction on self defence until about an hour and a half after retiring, when they sent a note requesting such a direction. The judge then directed them to the effect that the prosecution must prove that O did not believe he was using reasonable force. It was argued that the direction was inadequate by reason of the judge's failure to state that the test of what force was reasonable was subjective and the delay before the direction was given.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) _[R. v Scarlett (John) [1993] 4 All E.R. 629, [1993] 5 WLUK 53](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I651EC0F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=05a252c749594503996c9710cacf521f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ should not be read as saying a person was entitled to use any degree of force he believed to be reasonable, however ill founded the belief, _[R. v Williams (Gladstone) [1987] 3 All E.R. 411, [1983] 11 WLUK 279](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I73FA9E01E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=05a252c749594503996c9710cacf521f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. A person may use such force as is (objectively) reasonable in the circumstances as he (subjectively) believes them to be. The trial judge's direction went further in the defence's favour than the law required and

(2) although the direction was given late, it was adequate and properly left to the jury the correct basis upon which to approach their task.
