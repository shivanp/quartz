# R v Russell and Russell [1987] 85 Crim App R 388

Both parents of a 16-month-old daughter were convicted of manslaughter after she died from a massive dose of methadone. It did not matter that it could not be proven which parent had given her the dose, as long as the other had been there when it happened, so abetted the offence. The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the jury had convicted on this basis.

Where parents are jointly charged with a crime on their child, each parent had a duty to intervene in the ill-treatment of the child by the other. If there was no clear indication which parent was responsible for that ill-treatment then, in the absence of any explanation, it could be inferred that both parents were jointly responsible. A and M were registered drug addicts in receipt of prescriptions of methadone. Their 15-month-old child died from a massive overdose of methadone. When interviewed separately, both denied giving the child methadone save that on occasions they had dipped her dummy in the liquid. Both were charged with manslaughter and cruelty to a child under 16. The prosecution's evidence was that the amount of the drug in the child's body was too great to have been administered solely on its dummy. On the cruelty charge, the judge directed that the administration of methadone may lead to addiction causing suffering, injury or death. Both A and M were convicted of both offences. They appealed on the basis that the direction on cruelty was wrong and that the prosecution had failed to show which of them had administered the drug.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that in general parents jointly charged with the commission of a crime were in no different position to any other defendants. The only difference is that one parent might have a duty to intervene to prevent ill-treatment of their child whereas a stranger would have no such duty. Where the drug had been administered by one or both parents without any indication which one was responsible, it could be inferred that they were jointly responsible. There was evidence that in the past A and M had jointly administered the drug and, in the absence of any explanation from either, the jury could infer that the administration of the drug on the day in question was a joint enterprise. There was ample evidence for the judge to leave the question of cruelty to the jury as he did. Neither verdict was unsafe or unsatisfactory (_[R. v Gibson (Turhan Clint) (1985) 80 Cr.
