# R v Acott [1996] Crim LR 664

Held, that before a jury was directed to consider the issue of provocation in a murder trial, it was essential that some evidence of the words said or act done which provoked the defendant was presented. Provocation was an active word and therefore evidence that the defendant lost his temper was not sufficient.
