# R v Chan-Fook [1994] 1 WLR 689

Hobhouse LJ said:

> ‘the word “harm” is a synonym for injury. The word “actual” indicates that the injury (although there is no need for it to be permanent) should not be so trivial as to be wholly insignificant.’

The phrase "actual bodily harm" can include psychiatric injury where proved by medical evidence. A subjected a man whom he suspected of theft to aggressive questioning and left him locked in a room. A denied striking the victim or causing injury. The prosecution alleged that the victim had, at the very least, been reduced to a mental state which itself amounted to actual bodily harm. The judge directed the jury that an assault which caused an hysterical and nervous condition was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Held, allowing the appeal, that "actual bodily harm" could include psychiatric injury where properly proved by medical evidence, but did not include emotions or states of mind. The judge's directions were defective and there was no evidence to support an allegation of psychiatric injury (_[DPP v Smith [1961] A.C. 290, [1960] 7 WLUK 136](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9B0E8B10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e742a4917c5e49a6a2363a635a2de54e&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[R. v Miller (Peter) [1954] 2 Q.B. 282, [1953] 12 WLUK 38](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5A399980E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e742a4917c5e49a6a2363a635a2de54e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
