# Beatty v Gillibanks (1882) 9 QBD 308

Officers of the Salvation Army arranged a meeting in Weston-super-Mare which they knew was likely to produce a violent reaction from the Skeleton Army. There was a violent reaction. However, it was held that the Salvation Army officers had not procured the violence. They were not endeavouring to cause the violence.

There must be a causal link between D’s act and the commission of the offence.

The appellants assembled with others for a lawful purpose and with no intention of carrying out that purpose unlawfully, but with the knowledge that their assembly, would be opposed. They were also with good reason to suppose that a breach of the peace would be committed by those who opposed it. Two justices issued a public notice forbidding the continuation of such assemblies. The Queen’s Bench Division held that the appellants could not be rightly convicted of an unlawful assembly nor be bound over to keep the peace.
