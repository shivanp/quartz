# R v Brown [1994] 1 AC 212

FACTS: A group of sadomasochists, caused injuries to each other for sexual pleasure. No medical treatment was required. The participants were charged with offences of assault occasioning ABH under the **OAPA 1861, s 47** and causing GBH under the **OAPA 1861, s 20**. The defence of consent failed.

HELD: The court held that consent could not be a defence to anything greater than a battery, unless it fell into one of the accepted 'good reasons':

> 'â€¦ the line properly falls to be drawn between assault at common law and the offence of assault occasioning ABH created by sec 47of the 1861 Act with the result that consent of the victim is no answer to anyone charged with the latter offence or section 20 unless the circumstances fall within one of the well-known exceptions such as organised sporting contests and games, parental chastisement or reasonable surgery.' (_Per_ Lord Jauncey.)

## Summary

In the absence of a good reason, the victim's consent is no defence to a charge under the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search)) or [s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C0F52C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search)); the satisfying of sado-masochistic desires does not constitute such a good reason.

## Abstract

A, a group of sado-masochists, participated in consensual acts of violence against each other for sexual gratification. They were charged with various offences under the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search)) and [s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C0F52C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search)). On a ruling by the trial judge that the prosecution did not have to prove lack of consent by the victim, A pleaded guilty and were convicted. They appealed against conviction on the ground that the judge had erred in his ruling. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) dismissed the appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal (Lord Mustill and Lord Slynn of Hadley dissenting), that

(1) although a prosecutor had to prove lack of consent in order to secure a conviction for mere assault, it was not in the public interest that a person should wound or cause actual bodily harm to another for no good reason and, without such a reason, the victim's consent afforded no defence to a charge under s.20 or s.47;

(2) the satisfying of sado-masochistic desires did not constitute such a good reason;

(3) since A had admitted the charges against them and since the injuries inflicted were neither transient nor trifling, the question of consent was immaterial and the judge's ruling had, accordingly, been correct (_[R. v Donovan (John George) [1934] 2 K.B. 498, [1934] 7 WLUK 52](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I423E87F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search))_ , _[Attorney General's Reference (No.6 of 1980) [1981] Q.B. 715, [1981] 5 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6A7C00E1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and dictum of Cave J in _[R. v Coney (1882) 8 Q.B.D. 534, [1882] 3 WLUK 69](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3E118010E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied); and (4) (per Lord Templeman, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle and Lord Lowry) [art.7](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICB530F0F40924A5CAD123CF66E9DF5AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search)) and [art.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I13AEBA7190CB4FD6878845F048D2A987/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the [European Convention on Human Rights](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38C9C0AD773A4385868CB431E132B1A7/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a4ee2d62a2f430ab2dc66a05c16d6a5&contextData=(sc.Search)) have no application to the circumstances of the present case.
