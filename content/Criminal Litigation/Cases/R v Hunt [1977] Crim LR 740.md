# R v Hunt [1977] Crim LR 740

FACTS: In order to demonstrate the inadequacy of the fire alarm in a block of flats, Mr Hunt started a fire in a bedroom in a deserted part of the block. He pressed the fire alarm, which did not work. He then called the fire brigade.

HELD: The Court of Appeal, rejecting the defence under the **CDA 1971, s 5(2)(b)**, introduced an **objective** element into the defence in addition to those specifically mentioned in the Act. The court held that it was not sufficient that the accused **intended** to prevent further damage to property (as statutory language suggests) but also required that the act be objectively **capable** of protecting the property from damage.

H, believing that the council had been informed that fire alarms in a block of old people's flats did not work but had done nothing, set fire to a bed in a fairly isolated part of the block, told his wife to get the people out, summoned the fire brigade and broke the alarm to show it was not working. The judge withdrew the statutory defence under the [Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.5](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0803E730E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d34dc37f51504b628698d9791df6a1d6&contextData=(sc.Default)) from the jury.

Held, dismissing H's appeal against conviction of arson, that the test of whether an act was done "in order to protect property belonging to another" within s.5(2) was objective. H's act was not one which did or could in itself protect property.
