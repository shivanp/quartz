# R v Valujevs and another [2014] EWCA Crim 2888

#key-case

Valujevs and Mezals were gang masters who controlled a group of Latvian and Lithuanian workers who had come to Cambridgeshire in search of agricultural work. They found work for these workers and took responsibility for paying their wages and finding their accommodation. Valujevs and Mezals had been making deductions from the workers’ wages and had charged the workers inflated rents for their accommodation. The trial judge held that V and M were not in a position in which they were expected to safeguard or not act against the financial interests of the workers.

The decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal. In finding that the defendants occupied a position of trust as required by s 4, the court said it was clear from the wording of the section that Parliament did not intend to restrict the application of s 4 to those who owed a fiduciary duty to the victim. However, if there was no fiduciary duty it was necessary for the prosecution to show an obligation that is akin to a fiduciary duty.

Fulford LJ agreed with the judge that s 4 should not apply in

> ‘the general commercial area where individuals and businesses compete in markets of one kind or another, including labour markets, and are entitled to and expected to look after their own interests.’

So he concluded that the fact that the defendants provided accommodation for the workers did not give rise to the relevant position. What was crucial and put them into the required position was that the defendants assumed responsibility for collecting the workers’ wages.

He went on to consider whose expectation it should be that a defendant would not act against the financial interests of another person.

> ‘Although the statute does not provide any assistance on the issue, in our view the “expectation” in section 4 of the 2006 Act is an objective one. It is for the judge to assess whether the position held by the individual is capable of being one “in which he is expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person.’

If it is so capable, it will be for the jury thereafter to determine whether or not they are sure that was the case. It would be untenable to suggest that the expectation should be that of either the potential victim (the test would, in all likelihood, be too low) or the defendant (the test is likely to be set too high). Therefore, this is an objective test based on the position of the reasonable person.

## Summary

It was possible for an unlicensed gangmaster to be in a position whereby he was expected to safeguard the financial interests of another person within the meaning of the [Fraud Act 2006 s.4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID4854AA0754511DB8071C6D7F7AFDBBF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=014a64782dd145b0a8f2e2b51417296d&contextData=(sc.Default)). The critical factor in the instant case was that there was evidence that the gangmasters had assumed control of, and responsibility for, collecting the workers' wages or that they controlled the wages when they were handed over.

## Abstract

The Crown appealed against a judge's finding of no case to answer in a trial against the defendants for a count of fraud by abuse of position.

It was alleged that the defendants were unlicensed gangmasters who had abused their position by exploiting migrant workers by making unwarranted deductions from their wages, charging them excessive rental payments and imposing unwarranted fines on them. There was evidence that the defendants had the responsibility of paying the workers' wages and controlling the amounts paid to the workers. The indictment charged that they had committed fraud by abuse of position contrary to the [Fraud Act 2006 s.4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID4854AA0754511DB8071C6D7F7AFDBBF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=014a64782dd145b0a8f2e2b51417296d&contextData=(sc.Default)). At the close of the prosecution case, the defendants made a successful submission of no case to answer. The judge held that a gangmaster was not a position which came within the ambit of s.4. He concluded that Parliament could not have meant for the provision to apply in general commercial areas where individuals and businesses competed in markets, including labour markets, and were entitled to look after their own interests. He found that the requirement to pay the minimum wage did not create a general obligation on gangmasters to safeguard the financial interests of their workers.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) It was clear from the wording of s.4 that Parliament did not intend to restrict the operation of the section to situations where the defendant owed a fiduciary duty to the alleged victim. It was open to the jury on the evidence to decide that the defendants had gone beyond merely supplying workers and had assumed control of collecting the workers' wages and deciding the amounts that workers would be allowed to retain. It was inherent in the obligation allegedly taken on by the defendants that the wages would not be reduced by unwarranted financial penalties, unlawful demands or artificially-inflated rental payments. The prosecution were entitled to suggest that the defendants occupied a position in which they were expected to safeguard the financial interests of another person for the purposes of s.4. Having assumed responsibility for collecting the workers' wages, there was a clear expectation that the worker would receive them without a reduction. The expectation in s.4 was an objective one based on the position of the reasonable person. It was for the judge to assess whether the position held by the individual was capable of being one in which he was expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person. If it was so capable, it was for the jury thereafter to determine whether they were sure that that was the case. Gangmasters did not fall outside the ambit of s.4 (see paras 34, 37-38, 41-42 of judgment).

(2) Individuals did not commit a criminal offence under s.4 if they sought rental payments in excess of the market rate and gangmasters were not under an obligation to provide employment for those seeking work. Gangmasters were entitled to ask for repayment of money that they had lent to workers. To establish an abuse of position, it was necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate a breach of fiduciary duty or a breach of an obligation akin to a fiduciary duty. Section 4 did not apply in the general commercial area where individuals and businesses competed and were entitled to look after their own interests. The critical factor in the instant case was that there was evidence that the gangmasters had assumed control of, and responsibility for, collecting the workers' wages or that they controlled the wages when they were handed over (paras 43-44).
