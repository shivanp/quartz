## Summary

Convictions for conspiracy to rob and for murder were safe as there was ample evidence for the jury to reach a decision that the appellants had intended to permanently deprive the victim of his car and the judge had correctly ruled there was a case to answer and that evidence of each robbery was mutually supportive.

## Abstract

The appellants (R and J) appealed against their convictions for conspiracy to rob and J also appealed against his conviction for murder.

In order to carry out the conspiracies, R and J had posed as the potential buyers of cars. In the first robbery the victim (V) was introduced to J by R. J and a co-defendant later arranged to meet V to examine his car. V was then struck over the head, pulled from the car and the car was stolen. J later contacted V and offered to get his car back in return for a sum of money. The car was subsequently recovered by police. In the second robbery the victim was stabbed several times and later died from his injuries. The co-defendant's girlfriend was interviewed and a witness statement prepared, which contained material adverse to the co-defendant and J. The witness failed to attend trial despite a summons and warrant for her arrest being issued. The prosecution was of the view that as J and the co-defendant had raised cut-throat defences the statement should not be read as part of its case as it could significantly disadvantage the co-defendant's case. At trial R and J's submission that there was no case to answer in relation to the first robbery as the prosecution had failed to establish that they had intended to permanently deprive V of his car was rejected. J submitted that the judge should direct the prosecution to read the witness statement. The judge refused.

R and J submitted, amongst other things, that the judge was wrong in ruling there was a case to answer in respect of the first robbery. They contended that, taken at its highest, the evidence showed that the extent of any agreement between them was that V's car would be returned to him in exchange for money. R and J submitted that the evidence on the two conspiracies were not mutually supportive. J submitted that the judge was wrong to refuse to direct the prosecution to read out the witness statement.

## Held

Appeals dismissed.

(1) There was ample evidence for the jury to be invited to consider whether R and J had agreed to rob V. Whilst V was offered the opportunity to buy back his car that did not prevent the jury from concluding that an intention to permanently deprive him of it was established. The express language of the [Theft Act 1968 s.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1054e20d525645fd836e5f9029de7678&contextData=(sc.Default)) specified that the subjective element necessary to establish the mens rea for theft included an intention on the part of the taker "to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights". There was clearly such an intention in the instant case given that an offer was made to V to sell the car back to him subject to a condition inconsistent with his right to possession of his own property.

(2) The judge was entitled to conclude that the evidence on both the conspiracies was mutually supportive. There were significant similarities between the two incidents and evidence in relation to each robbery that linked R to both offences. The evidence also demonstrated that J was present at both robberies and had participated physically in them.

(3) There was no prejudice caused to J by the judge's refusal to direct the prosecution to read the witness statement. It would be rare for a judge to conclude that the prosecution should be ordered to adduce evidence which, in the view of the prosecution, would undermine the fairness of the process. If J wanted the hearsay evidence to go before the jury it would have gone before the jury as a whole, not just the parts favourable to J, as part of J's case. There was overwhelming evidence that the co-defendant had used the knife to stab the victim and J would have gained nothing if the statement had been adduced.
