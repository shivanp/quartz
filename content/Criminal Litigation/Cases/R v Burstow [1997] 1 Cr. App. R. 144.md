# R v Burstow [1997] 1 Cr. App. R. 144

B appealed against conviction of unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm under the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5f693436e4264d5c936120a6c79303d4&contextData=(sc.Search)). He had become obsessed with a colleague with whom he worked, and after she ended the relationship he made telephone calls, sent letters and photographs and visited the victim's home, all of which had a profound psychological effect on her. B argued that to commit an offence contrary to s.20, it was necessary for him to apply physical violence directly or indirectly to the victim and as he had done neither he could only be guilty of the lesser offence of "causing" contrary to s.18 of the Act.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that it was possible for a stalker to be convicted of an "inflicting" offence under s.20. It had already been established that both actual and grievous bodily harm could include psychiatric injury, especially now that the distinction between mental and physical injury had become blurred, _[R. v Chan-Fook (Mike) [1994] 1 W.L.R. 689, [1993] 10 WLUK 234](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3A1A0720E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5f693436e4264d5c936120a6c79303d4&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied. Consequently the instant case could be distinguished from others cited and the defendant was guilty of "inflicting" harm.
