# Eaves v Hickson (1861) 30 Beav 136

Trustees who paid over the trust fund to wrong persons, trusting to a marriage certificate, which turned out to be a forgery, made responsible for so much of the trust fund as could not be recovered from those who had wrongfully received it. The father of the recipients, who had sent the forged certificate of his marriage to the trustees, was also made responsible for the money.
