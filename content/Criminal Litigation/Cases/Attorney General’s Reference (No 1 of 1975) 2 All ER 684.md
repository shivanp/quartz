# Attorney General’s Reference (No 1 of 1975) 2 All ER 684

> ‘To procure means to produce by endeavour.’

In this case D added alcohol to P’s drink without his knowledge or consent. When P later got in his car and drove, his blood/alcohol concentration was higher than the prescribed limit. D had procured P to commit a drink-driving offence. There is no need for consensus. It is immaterial whether the procuring is relied on. In this case it was done without P’s knowledge or consent.

A person who knows that a motorist is going to drive and surreptitiously adds alcohol to his drink so as to bring his blood-alcohol concentration above the statutory limit, is guilty of procuring the consequent offence. D, knowing that M, a motorist, was going to drive home, surreptitiously laced his drinks. M then drove with a blood-alcohol concentration above the statutory limit. D was charged with aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of the offence within the [Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 s.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C834A40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a8c295f017bc4397be603b8fc12dc31a&contextData=(sc.Search)) . He was acquitted on a submission of no case to answer. On the Attorney-General's reference to the Court of Appeal, held, that there was a case to answer, and the defendant was not entitled to the ruling.
