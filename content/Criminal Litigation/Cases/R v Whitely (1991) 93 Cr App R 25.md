# R v Whitely (1991) 93 Cr App R 25

It is an offence of damaging property to alter unlawfully data contained on a computer disk. D, a computer hacker, gained unauthorised access to a computer system, and altered data contained on the disks, thereby causing the system to have to be shut down. Neither the computers nor the disks suffered any physical damage. D was convicted of causing criminal damage to the disks by altering the state of the particles on the disks. He appealed on the ground that a distinction had to be drawn between the disks and the information on them, the information not being capable of damage under the law.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the property had to be tangible, not the damage, and if the particles on a disk were altered in such a way as to impair their value, that amounted to damage under the [Criminal Damage Act 1971](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60608EE0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=47bbaf20bb05474eb95b5d02f9337ca3&contextData=(sc.Default))(_[R. v Fisher (William) (1865-72) L.R. 1 C.C.R. 7, [1865] 11 WLUK 57](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I439899B0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=47bbaf20bb05474eb95b5d02f9337ca3&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[R. v Tacey 168 E.R. 893, [1821] 1 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF3A0A710E57411DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=47bbaf20bb05474eb95b5d02f9337ca3&contextData=(sc.Default))_, dicta of Stephen Brown L.J. in _[Cox v Riley (1986) 83 Cr.
