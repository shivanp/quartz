B and S stole goods from a freezer container in a farmyard, the container being 25 feet long by seven feet by seven feet, weighing three tons and not having been moved for over two years.

Held, dismissing appeals against findings of guilt of burglary, that the container was "a structure of considerable size and intended to be permanent or at least to endure for a considerable time" and was therefore a building within s.9 of the 1968 Act.
