# R v Gladstone Williams (1984) 78 Cr App R 276 (CA)

FACTS: In this case, V saw a woman being robbed and attempted to lawfully apprehend the robber. Williams arrived on the scene and mistakenly thought that the robber was being unlawfully attacked by V. Williams attacked V and was later charged under the **Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 47**. Williams successfully argued self-defence. In fact, force was not necessary, as the robber was not being unlawfully attacked. Williams was mistaken.

HELD: The court held that his actions must be judged according to the facts as he honestly believed them to be:

> 'The reasonableness or unreasonableness of the defendant's belief is material to the question of whether the belief was held by the defendant at all. If the belief was in fact held, its unreasonableness, so far as guilt or innocence is concerned, is neither here nor there. It is irrelevant.
>
> In a case of self defence, where self defence or the prevention of crime is concerned, if the jury come to the conclusion that the defendant believed, or may have believed, that he was being attacked or that a crime was being committed, and that force was necessary to protect himself or to prevent the crime, then the prosecution will not have proved their case.'

A mistaken belief that someone is being unlawfully assaulted need not be reasonable, provided it is honestly held. W saw M arresting a youth. M said he was a police officer but failed to produce a warrant card. W, believing that the youth was being unlawfully assaulted by M, himself assaulted M. The jury was directed that W must have had an honest belief based on reasonable grounds that reasonable force was necessary to prevent a crime.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the jury should have been directed that, first, the prosecution had the burden of proving the unlawfulness of W's actions; secondly, if W might have been labouring under a mistake as to the facts, he was to be judged according to his mistaken view of the facts, whether or not that mistake was, on an objective view, reasonable. The reasonableness of W's belief was material to the question whether the belief was held by him at all. If the belief was held, its unreasonableness, so far as guilt or innocence was concerned, was irrelevant (_[DPP v Morgan [1976] A.C. 182, [1975] 4 WLUK 75](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AFE5E70E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c0238b57db5a4bd6a4b9b349a6809916&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
