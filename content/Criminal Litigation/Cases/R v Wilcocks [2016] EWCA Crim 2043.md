# R v Wilcocks [2016] EWCA Crim 2043

A case where the victim had taunted the defendant about his failed suicide attempts, the Court of Appeal approved the trial judge, Holroyde J’s direction –

> ‘If and insofar as you conclude a personality disorder reduced his general capacity for tolerance and self-restraint, that would not be a relevant circumstance when you are considering the defence of loss of control. But it is important to emphasise that this exclusion only relates to any feature of a personality disorder which reduced his general capacity for tolerance and self-restraint. Let me give you an illustration. If you thought that CW suffered from a personality disorder which made him unusually likely to become angry and aggressive at the slightest provocation, that would of course be relevant to diminished responsibility, but it could not assist him in relation to loss of control. But if you thought that a personality disorder had caused him to attempt suicide, then you would be entitled to take into account as one of his circumstances the effect on him of being taunted that he should have killed himself.’

## Summary

The court refused permission to appeal against a conviction for murder where the defendant had relied on diminished responsibility. The reverse burden of proof in respect of diminished responsibility in the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ddd9d1f8b2914bf98e3d6611a62870b8&contextData=(sc.Default)) did not infringe [ECHR art.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAE1FBD48E5924705BFBD5299078ED2BC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ddd9d1f8b2914bf98e3d6611a62870b8&contextData=(sc.Default)).

## Abstract

The appellant (W) applied for permission to appeal against his conviction for murder and appealed against his sentence of life detention with a minimum term of 16 years.

The victim was W's partner. He had killed her when he was aged 19 and she was 17. W admitted that he had strangled the victim during an argument, causing her to pass out for a few seconds. A second argument followed, during which W strangled the victim again and she died. He denied murder on the grounds of loss of control and diminished responsibility. He relied on considerable emotional and behavioural problems, including difficulties at school, self-harm and suicide attempts. The expert witnesses at trial disagreed as to whether W suffered a borderline personality disorder and if so whether it amounted to substantial impairment.

W argued that the judge had erred in rejecting his submission that the reverse burden of proof in respect of diminished responsibility in the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ddd9d1f8b2914bf98e3d6611a62870b8&contextData=(sc.Default)) infringed his rights under [ECHR art.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAE1FBD48E5924705BFBD5299078ED2BC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ddd9d1f8b2914bf98e3d6611a62870b8&contextData=(sc.Default)). He argued that _[R. v Foye (Lee Robert) [2013] EWCA Crim 475, (2013) 177 J.P. 449, [2013] 4 WLUK 541](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I90D5FCA0AD2E11E29B5FBBD370801A3D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ddd9d1f8b2914bf98e3d6611a62870b8&contextData=(sc.Default))_, which had found that s.2(2) did not infringe art.6, was wrong, or that it should be distinguished as it had dealt with s.2 as it had stood before a subsequent amendment. In support of his argument on the burden of proof for diminished responsibility, he noted that Lord Judge had observed in _[R. v Asmelash (Dawit) [2013] EWCA Crim 157, [2014] Q.B. 103, [2013] 2 WLUK 657](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE919A1907D4611E2B4FFCECE641EBF70/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ddd9d1f8b2914bf98e3d6611a62870b8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ that it was inconceivable that different criteria should govern the approach to the issue of voluntary intoxication depending on whether the defence advanced was diminished responsibility or loss of control. W argued alternatively that the burden of proof could vary according to the facts of the case.

Regarding sentence, W argued that the judge had made insufficient allowance for his mental disorder, had given no adequate weight to his age and immaturity, had given no credit for the lack of premeditation, and had put too much reliance on the fact there had been two instances of strangulation.

## Held

Permission refused, appeal dismissed.

**Conviction -** The statement of the law and applicable principles in Foye were clear and the decision was binding. The instant case could not be distinguished from Foye. The statutory provision that on a charge of murder it should be for the defence to prove diminished responsibility remained exactly the same, Foye followed. The remarks in Asmelash should not be taken out of context. Lord Judge had been questioning the absurdity of having different rules about the relevance of voluntary intoxication for the two defences, not different burdens of proof. It was commonplace for the defences of loss of control and diminished responsibility to be run in tandem. It caused no real difficulty, Asmelash considered. The suggestion that the statutory burden would shift depending on the individual facts was nonsense. There was no basis for such an interpretation in s.2(2) itself. There was nothing arbitrary or unreasonable about the legal burden being placed on a defendant who wished to assert the partial defence of diminished responsibility (see paras [45-49](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

**Sentence -** The judge had not been obliged to accept what the defence experts had told the jury. He had been entitled to reach his own conclusions on the weight to be attached to the personality disorder. While age was relevant, and chronological age was not always the best guide to maturity, the judge had not simply taken W's age and ignored all the other material about his background. The evidence supported his assessment. The court rejected the complaint about the failure to give credit for lack of premeditation and about treating the two attempts at strangulation as aggravation. W might not have planned the killing in advance, but, having strangled the victim once, instead of helping her, he had strangled her for a second time until she was dead. The minimum term was not excessive (paras [59-62](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
