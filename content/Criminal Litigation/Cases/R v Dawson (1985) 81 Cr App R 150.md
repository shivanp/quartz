# R v Dawson (1985) 81 Cr App R 150

The defendant and accomplices, wearing masks and armed with an imitation gun and a pickaxe handle, robbed a petrol station. The cashier suffered from a heart condition and died shortly after the robbery. The trial judge had directed the jury that the reasonable person would know of the victim's bad heart. This was held to be a misdirection and their appeals were allowed on the basis that a sober and reasonable person present at the scene of the crime would have known the robbery could cause fear but could not have known of the heart condition:

> 'This test can only be undertaken upon the basis of the knowledge gained by a sober and reasonable man as though he were present at the scene of and watched the unlawful act being performed â€¦ In other words, he has the same knowledge as the man attempting to rob and no more.'

The Court of Appeal overturned the conviction because the jury had been misdirected. It is possible that a properly directed jury could have found what the defendants did to be dangerous.

The requisite "harm" is caused in the context of manslaughter if the unlawful act so shocks the victim as to cause him physical injury. The appellants robbed a 60 year old garage attendant at midnight with a pickaxe handle and a replica gun. The victim suffered from heart disease. Shortly after the police arrived he collapsed and died from a heart attack. The appellants were charged with manslaughter. When the judge came to direct the jury on the second element of manslaughter of "harm", and whether the unlawful act was one that all sober and reasonable people would realise was likely to cause some harm, he told them that putting a person in such terror that he might suffer such emotional or physical disturbance as would be "determined" was sufficient.

Held, allowing the appeal, that there was no reason why shock produced by fright should not come within the definition of "harm". However, assuming without deciding (though the court was inclined to favour the proposition) that "harm" included injury through the operation of shock emanating from fright, it was unfortunate that the judge had used the disjunctive "or". The jury were thus left with a choice, and could have convicted on the basis that emotional disturbances could amount to "harm", which it could not. Further the word "detrimental" did not assist. A proper direction would have been that the requisite harm was cause if the unlawful act so shocked the victim as to cause him physical injury ( _[R. v Bracewell (Michael Geoffrey) (1979) 68 Cr.
