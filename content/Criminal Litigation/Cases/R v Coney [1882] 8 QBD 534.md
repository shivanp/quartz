# R v Coney [1882] 8 QBD 534

Three spectators at an illegal prize-fight were charged with battery as accessories (the principals being the two fighters). Although the Divisional Court accepted that the presence of the spectators could be seen as an encouragement, since the fighters would not be fighting if there was no audience, the conviction of the defendants was quashed as the trial judgeâ€™s summing up may have lead the jury to conclude that mere presence at the scene would be sufficient to amount to the offence.

Two fighters fought in a ring of cord. Bets were made by persons in the crowd of from 130 to 150 persons around the ring. The prisoners were in the crowd, but they were not speaking or betting, or taking any part in the fight, or doing anything. They were charged upon an indictment for assaults upon the fighters. The chairman directed the jury that all persons, who went to a prize-fight to see the combatants strike each other, and who were present when they did so, were in point of law guilty of an assault. If they were not casually passing by but stayed at the place, they encouraged it by their presence. The jury found the prisoners guilty but added that it was in consequence of the direction of law of the chairman. The Court for Crown Cases Reserved, quashing the conviction, held that the finding of the jury was in obedience to that direction without exercising its own judgment upon the sufficiency of the evidence as to encouraging, or aiding and abetting the fight.
