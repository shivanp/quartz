# R v O'Connor [1991] Crim LR 135

O was convicted of murder after pleading a defence of self-defence based on his perception that an attack was necessary in self-defence.

Held, substituting a verdict of manslaughter, that

(1) where self-induced intoxication gave rise to a mistaken belief on a defendant's part that force was necessary in self-defence, a plea of self-defence failed;

(2) generally a defendant's intention and desire coincided and a direction on the question of foresight was rarely necessary; (3) the judge had erred in directing the jury on the possible effect of intoxication only on O's capacity to form the necessary specific intent to do grievous bodily harm. He should have directed the jury that self-induced intoxication could have prevented O from forming the specific intent ( _[R. v O'Grady (Patrick Gerald) [1987] Q.B. 995, [1987] 6 WLUK 125](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5F7419C0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9d8820944d2d4fb7a5f79c0c60d883c7&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[R. v Garlick (Clifford Patrick) (1981) 72 Cr.
