# Smith v Chief Superintendent, Woking Police Station (1983) 76 Cr App R 234

FACTS: Smith entered the garden of a house at night and looked through the window of a ground floor bedroom at the victim who was in a nightdress. He pressed his face against the glass for several seconds. The victim recognised Smith and was terrified. He appealed on the ground that there was no evidence that he had the _mens rea_ for assault.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. Lord Justice Kerr stated that this was a situation where although the victim did not know what the defendant was going to do next, she feared some immediate violence which was what the D in this case intended.
