# R v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171

Adomako was an anaesthetist attending an operation. The defendant did not appreciate that there had been a disconnection of the oxygen tube. After 4 mins an alarm sounded. Despite resuscitation attempts, the patient died 9 minutes after the disconnection. At no stage between the alarm and the death was the connection checked. This was despite the fact that the patient started to turn blue after the oxygen tube had been disconnected. The prosecution called witnesses who stated that: 'the standard of care that the patient received was abysmal’. Checking the oxygen tube would have been absolutely basic procedure.

Lord Mackay gave the question as follows:

> 'This is necessarily a question of degree, and an attempt to specify that degree more closely is I think likely to achieve only a spurious precision. The essence of the matter which is supremely a jury question is whether, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission.’

Adomako is perhaps unusual in that it involved a single, terrible mistake leading to liability (though Lord MacKay emphasises that A missed several opportunities to spot what was wrong).

In cases involving manslaughter by breach of a duty of care the relevant questions are whether there existed a duty of care, whether there had been a breach of that duty, whether the breach had caused the death and, if so, whether the breach should be characterised as gross negligence and a crime. It is for a jury to decide whether the accused's acts were so bad that in all the circumstances they amounted to a crime. It is not necessary for a judge to refer to the test of recklessness in R. v Lawrence. D was acting as an anaesthetist during an operation when a tube from the ventilator came free, causing the death of the patient. D was convicted of manslaughter and his appeal dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing D's appeal, that the question whether D's acts or omissions were so bad as to be criminal having regard to the risk of death involved was one for the jury and it was not appropriate to interfere with their decision _[R. v Bateman (Percy) (1927) 19 Cr.
