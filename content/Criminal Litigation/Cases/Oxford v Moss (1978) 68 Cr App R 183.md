# Oxford v Moss (1978) 68 Cr App R 183

An information was preferred against a university student who acquired the proof of an examination paper. It alleged that he stole intangible property, namely confidential information being the property of the Senate of the university. It was agreed that the student did not intend permanently to deprive the university of the proof itself. The justices dismissed the charge on the ground that confidential information was not intangible property within [s 4](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251968_60a_SECT_4%25&A=0.6314380543862681&backKey=20_T448088118&service=citation&ersKey=23_T448088109&langcountry=GB) of the Theft Act 1968. The confidence consisted in a right to control publication of the proof, which was a right over property. The prosecutor appealed by case stated. The Crown Court held that there was no property in the confidential information capable of being the subject of a charge of theft. Thus, in the instant case, the appeal would be dismissed.
