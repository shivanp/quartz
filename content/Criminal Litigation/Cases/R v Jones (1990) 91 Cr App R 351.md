# R v Jones (1990) 91 Cr App R 351

The words "more than merely preparatory" in the [Criminal Attempts Act 1981](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I602CADA0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d8628e0d107404bbb63bed677634a07&contextData=(sc.Default)) do not mean the "last act within his power". J was tried for attempted murder. It was submitted that there was insufficient evidence of attempt because J would have had to perform three further acts to complete the full offence. They were (1) to remove the safety catch of the gun being pointed at the victim; (2) to put his finger on the trigger and (3) to pull the trigger.

Held, dismissing the appeal against conviction, that the correct approach was to give the words of the statute their natural meaning; the words "more than merely preparatory" did not mean the "last act within his power", _[R. v Gullefer (Ian John) [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1063, [1986] 11 WLUK 198](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I48299380E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d8628e0d107404bbb63bed677634a07&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
