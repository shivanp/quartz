# R v Wilson [1984] AC 242

When a defendant is charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm under the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1fc51911a8a64f84b4cdefcbaebd4267&contextData=(sc.Default)) or the [Theft Act 1968 s.9(1)(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF694F90E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1fc51911a8a64f84b4cdefcbaebd4267&contextData=(sc.Default)) , it is open to the jury to find him guilty of occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s.47 of the 1861 Act. W was charged under s.20 of the 1861 Act. The jury were directed that they could convict him of the alternative offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. W was convicted of the lesser offence. J was charged under s.9(1)(b) of the 1968 Act. The jury was similarly directed and J was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Both convictions were quashed on appeal.

Held, on appeal by the prosecution, restoring the convictions, that

(1) both charges impliedly included allegations of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which constituted another offence within the [Criminal Law Act 1967 s.6(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC9A87690E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1fc51911a8a64f84b4cdefcbaebd4267&contextData=(sc.Default)) ;

(2) on both charges it was open to the jury to return the verdict they did ( _[R. v Springfield (David) (1969) 53 Cr.
