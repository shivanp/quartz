# R v Ruffell [2003] EWCA Crim 122

FACTS: The victim was at R's house. They were taking drugs. V became unconscious and R tried to revive him. He telephoned V's mother the next day. R said that V was ill and sitting on R's doorstep. V's mother told R to take V inside and keep him warm. R agreed, but did not, returning to bed. Later V was found by a passer-by, taken to hospital and he died. The trial judge directed the jury that a duty of care could be assumed: V was a friend, V was in R's house, R had attempted to revive him. The jury was told if they decided R had assumed this duty, they were entitled to decide whether by putting V outside R had breached that duty. The jury decided in the affirmative and R was convicted.

HELD: The Court of Appeal followed the approach taken in **_Stone and Dobinson_** and upheld the conviction.
