# R v Stringer and Banks (1991) Crim LR 639

An employer told his employees to make accounting transactions which (unknown to those employees) resulted in fraudulent transfers. The employer was the principal and the employees were innocent agents.

---

A business manager of M&B (S) arranged for a director of IGP (B) to submit false invoices which were signed by a junior manager of M&B and passed for payment by another M&B employee. S appealed against his conviction for theft claiming there had been no appropriation within the meaning of s.3(1) of the 1968 Act.

Held: Appeal dismissed. The authorities confirmed that the acts of innocent agents could provide the requisite appropriation for the offence of theft. The innocent actions of the parties clearing the cheques caused the appropriation and not the drawing of the cheques. It was S who had a dishonest intention when he signed the invoice which initiated the series of events causing M&B's account to be debited with the material amounts. The innocent employees had merely complied with S's instructions by processing the documentation in a manner he had anticipated, to achieve his dishonest purposes, which they had not verified. The situation may have been different if S's co-signatories had decided by their own volition whether or not to pass the invoices for payment.
