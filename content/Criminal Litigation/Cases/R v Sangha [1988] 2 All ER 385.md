# R v Sangha [1988] 2 All ER 385

FACTS: Mr Sangha set fire to some furniture in a flat. There was no danger to the occupants since they were not present at the time. There was no danger to the occupants of adjacent flats because of the special construction of the building.

HELD: The Court of Appeal upheld the defendant's conviction on the basis, _inter alia_, that the issue was whether the accused intended or was reckless as to whether life might have been endangered, not whether life was actually endangered.

When considering whether setting fire to something created an obvious and serious risk of damaging property and thereby endangering the life of another, the question is, would an ordinary prudent bystander have perceived at the time the fire was started an obvious risk that property would be damaged and life would thereby be endangered? D set fire to two armchairs in a temporarily unoccupied flat. He was charged with arson contrary to the [Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.1(2)(a) and (b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I07FFEF90E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b4b9bcf571be4902bc770d322831de8c&contextData=(sc.Search)) being reckless as to whether the property would be damaged, and whether the life of another would be endangered. D submitted that there was no case, since if he knew that nobody was present or did not know whether or not anybody was present, his actions could not have created an obvious and serious risk of danger to the life of another.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the question was, would the ordinary prudent bystander have perceived at the time the fire was started an obvious risk that property would be damaged and life would thereby be endangered? The fact that there were special features which prevented the danger materialising was irrelevant, and D was properly convicted.
