# R v Walkington [1979] 2 All ER 716

FACTS: D entered a department store lawfully and then went into an area bounded by a moveable three sided counter where he opened a cash till.

HELD: What amounts to a part of a building is a question of fact for the jury to decide. On the facts of this case, it was clear that the defendant knew that he was not allowed into the till area. Consequently, the jury could find that he had entered part of a building.

A jury is entitled to conclude that a counter area within a shop is a part of a building from which the public are excluded. The appellant was seen in a department store to enter into a counter area situated on the sales floor and there open the till drawer (which was empty). He then left. He was charged with entering as a trespasser "part of a building" with intent to steal. He claimed in evidence that he had not realised that he was not permitted to enter the counter area. He was convicted following the trial judge's direction to the jury in which he left to them the issues as to whether the counter area was a part of the building and whether the appellant had knowingly entered it as a trespasser. The jury were further left to decide whether at that time the appellant intended to steal.

Held, dismissing his appeal, that (1) the jury were correctly left to consider the issue of trespass; and (2) the evidence clearly indicated the appellant's intention to steal the contents of the till; a person entering premises intending to steal is guilty of an offence notwithstanding that there is nothing in the premises worth stealing.
