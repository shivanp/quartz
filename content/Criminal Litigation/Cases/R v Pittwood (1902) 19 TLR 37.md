# R v Pittwood (1902) 19 TLR 37

FACTS: Pittwood was employed as a level-crossing gatekeeper. He failed to close the gate when a train was coming and a man was killed by the train.

HELD: Pittwood's failure to close the gate could amount to the _actus reus_ of manslaughter by omission, because he was under a contractual duty to do so when a train was approaching.
