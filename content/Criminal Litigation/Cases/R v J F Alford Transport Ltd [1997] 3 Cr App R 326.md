# R v J F Alford Transport Ltd [1997] 3 Cr App R 326

The company, together with the managing director and transport director, were convicted as accessories to offences of falsifying tachograph records, committed by 19 drivers employed by the company. They appealed, arguing that convictions required evidence of positive assistance or encouragement to commit the offence.

The Court of Appeal held that the company was in a position of control over the drivers and that passive acquiescence in such a circumstance was sufficient. It was not even necessary for the prosecution to prove that the appellants intended their acquiescence to encourage the drivers, just that they knew their silence would have this effect. This case also confirms that it is not necessary for an inactive participator to be present at the scene of the crime.

ATL, a company, and its managing director and transport manager appealed against their convictions for aiding and abetting the making of false entries on tachograph record sheets by lorry drivers employed by ATL contrary to the [Transport Act 1968](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6070BB81E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f68c12cab91941ff9f4c8672f9de7a0b&contextData=(sc.Search)) s.99(5). The issues on appeal were (1) whether evidence of the appellants' passive acquiescence was sufficient for a conviction, and (2) the adequacy of the jury directions given regarding the defendants' failure to give evidence.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) it was necessary to show that the defendant intended to do acts which he knew to be capable of assisting or encouraging the commission of the principal offence, although it was not necessary to show that the defendant intended the crime to be committed. If one of the defendants could be shown to have knowledge of any particular count, the jury would be entitled to find that he had positively encouraged the commission of the offence, but in the instant case no such knowledge had been proved. Where a defendant could control the principal offender's actions it had to be proven that in addition to having knowledge of the principal offence a defendant had taken a positive decision not to prevent its commission, and

(2) the jury direction was inadequate in light of the decision in _[R. v Cowan (Donald) [1996] Q.B. 373, [1995] 10 WLUK 131](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3E69B230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f68c12cab91941ff9f4c8672f9de7a0b&contextData=(sc.Search))_, in that the jury were not told that an inference from a failure to give evidence could not prove guilt on its own under the [Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 s.38(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFC6839A0E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f68c12cab91941ff9f4c8672f9de7a0b&contextData=(sc.Search)). Given the highly suspicious circumstances involved and the lack of prima facie evidence, proper presentation of the case might have led to an inference of knowledge being drawn from a failure to testify.
