# Lynch v DPP for Northern Ireland [1975] AC 653

FACTS: In this case members of the IRA threatened to kill Lynch, a taxi driver, unless he drove them to the house of a police officer. Lynch knew that the men intended to murder the police officer. He therefore attended to assist them in this crime even though he was horrified by it.

HELD: It was held that intention in this context does not mean desire, so there is no need for direct intent. It is enough that D had oblique intent.

Duress is a defence to a charge of aiding and abetting murder. D drove a car containing members of the IRA, who shot and killed a police officer. D was charged with aiding and abetting the murder. He claimed that he acted under duress, in fear that he would be shot if he did not cooperate. The trial judge held that the defence of duress was not open to him, he was convicted, and the Court of Criminal Appeal of Northern Ireland upheld the conviction. On appeal to the House of Lords, held, the defence of duress was open to a principal in the second degree to murder and a new trial would be ordered.
