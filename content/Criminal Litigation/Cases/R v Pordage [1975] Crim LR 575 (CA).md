# R v Pordage [1975] Crim LR 575 (CA)

P was convicted of wounding B with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. P had been drinking and denied using the weapons he was alleged to have used or said he did not remember doing so. The judge directed the jury to consider whether D was capable of forming the requisite intent.

Held, that the jury had been misdirected since the question was whether P actually formed such intent. However, the proviso would be applied as the evidence was over-whelming.
