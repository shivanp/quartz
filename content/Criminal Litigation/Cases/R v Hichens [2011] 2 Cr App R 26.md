# R v Hichens [2011] 2 Cr App R 26

FACTS: In this case, D had moved in with a friend (Y), but Y's ex-boyfriend objected to the arrangement. He had come to the flat twice and threatened D. The police were called on both occasions, and warned the ex-boyfriend to stay away. On one previous occasion he had gained access to the flat and attempted to fight D. The ex-boyfriend came to the flat again and Y wanted to let him in. D urged her not to, and slapped her across the face when she would not listen to him. D claimed that he had used reasonable force to prevent the commission of a crime/act in self-defence, since, if the ex-boyfriend had entered the flat, there might have been an altercation between them.

In response to a jury question, the judge stated that Y was not about to commit a crime, and the possibility that the ex-boyfriend might do so was not sufficient to justify D's actions in slapping her. D was convicted. He appealed, submitting that the judge had erred in directing that self-defence was not available to him.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. However, the court did confirm that this defence was capable of extending to the use of force against an innocent third party to prevent a crime being committed by someone else. The court felt that facts capable of giving rise to such a defence would only rarely be encountered and might include:

- a police constable bundling a passer-by out of the way to get at a person the constable believed was about to shoot a firearm or detonate an explosive device; or
- a person seeking to give car keys to another to enable them to drive and X, believing that other to be unfit to drive through drink, knocked the keys out of the first person's hands and retained them.

The Court of Appeal confirmed that a defendant could use force against an innocent third party to protect themselves.

## Summary

Self-defence and the defence of using reasonable force in the prevention of crime under the [Criminal Law Act 1967 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC9A39490E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c58b481e78d940679d63ed55c8072502&contextData=(sc.Default)) were capable of extending to the use of force against an innocent third party to prevent a crime being committed by someone else.

## Abstract

The appellant (K) appealed against his conviction for common assault.

K had moved in with a friend (Y), but Y's ex-boyfriend objected to the arrangement. He had come to the flat twice and threatened K. The police were called on both occasions, and warned the ex-boyfriend to stay away. On one previous occasion he had gained access to the flat and attempted to fight K. The ex-boyfriend came to the flat again and Y wanted to let him in. K urged her not to let him in, and slapped her across the face when she would not listen to him. He claimed that he had used reasonable force to prevent the commission of a crime, since if the ex-boyfriend had entered the flat there might have been an altercation between them. He also relied on the defences of necessity and self-defence. In response to a jury question, the judge stated that Y was not about to commit a crime, and the possibility that the ex-boyfriend might do so was not sufficient to justify K's actions in slapping her.

K submitted that the judge had erred in directing that the defences of necessity, self-defence and the use of reasonable force under the [Criminal Law Act 1967 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC9A39490E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c58b481e78d940679d63ed55c8072502&contextData=(sc.Default)) were not available to him.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The judge had withdrawn K's defences from the jury in response to the jury's question by stating that the facts relied upon by K did not disclose a defence in law to the charge of common assault. There was no error in the judge withdrawing the defence of necessity from the jury. The defence of necessity was recognised only in very limited circumstances, and traditionally the nature of the harm forestalled had to be death or serious injury. Neither was a realistic possibility in the instant case (see paras [21-24](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) However, self-defence and the defence furnished by s.3 of the 1967 Act were capable of extending to the use of force against an innocent third party to prevent a crime being committed by someone else. In so far as the judge thought that those defences were not capable of extending to the use of force against an innocent third party, he was wrong. The facts capable of giving rise to such a defence would only rarely be encountered and might include: a police constable bundling a passerby out of the way to get at a man he believed was about to shoot with a firearm or detonate an explosive device; a person seeking to give car keys to another to enable him to drive and X, believing that other to be unfit to drive through drink, knocked the keys out of the first person's hands and retained them. The question of remoteness also had to be considered, namely the degree of likelihood and imminence of the crime being committed. Plainly. both defences had greater scope for operation where it was certain, or nearly certain, that a crime would be committed immediately if action was not taken (paras [30-31](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The judge had been wrong to withdraw the defences of self-defence and the use of force in the prevention of crime from the jury. However, K's conviction was safe in any event because a reasonable jury, properly directed, with a suitable emphasis on the question of remoteness, would not have acquitted him. Even on the most favourable view of the facts, the prosecution case was overwhelming. Y was not committing or threatening to commit any crime herself. At the time of the slapping, no crime was being committed and there was no certainty that any crime would be committed should the ex-boyfriend enter the flat. K had other options including calling the police or leaving the flat, and ample time to exercise them, but had failed to do so (paras [28-29, 32](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
