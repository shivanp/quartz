# R v Litchfield [1998] Crim LR 508

The captain of a schooner was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence when three of his crew members died after he sailed perilously close to the Cornish coast, knowing that he would have to rely on his engines and knowing that they may break down as a result of him using contaminated fuel.

According to the trial judge ‘with his vast experience of sailing, he must have appreciated the obvious and serious risk of death to his crew in navigating his ship in the way he did.’

The Court of Appeal upheld his conviction based on the trial judge's direction that the question for the jury was whether the captain's conduct was:

> '… so bad, so obviously wrong, that it can be properly condemned as criminal, not in some technical sense of the word, like somebody might be regarded as criminal if they did not have a light on the back of their bicycle, but in the ordinary language of men and women of the world.'

In this case, the fact that the defendant had recognised the risk made it easier for the jury to find he had been grossly negligent.
