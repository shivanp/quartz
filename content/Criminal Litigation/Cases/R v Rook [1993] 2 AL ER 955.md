# R v Rook [1993] 2 AL ER 955

FACTS: Rook and another were recruited by a man to kill his wife and paid money to do so. Rook recruited a fourth man to help. On the day of the killing, the husband drove his wife to the place where it was arranged she should be killed and the fourth man killed her. Rook never turned up and claimed he never intended to be involved in the killing, he just wanted the money.

HELD: Lord Justice Lloyd held that the minimum which was required was unequivocal communication of his intention to withdraw. It may be that further steps would have been necessary to neutralise his actions, but as the minimum was not there, the court did not consider what else would be required.

For assistance, the relevant time for the _mens rea_ is at the time of the act of assistance, not at the time when the principal commits the crime.

Therefore, the withdrawal must take place, before the act of assistance.

Where D has supplied the principal with the means of committing the crime and has given assistance, this will be less easily neutralised than where D has just given advice.
