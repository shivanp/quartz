# Parker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 All ER 834

FACTS: The defendant was an airline passenger who found a gold bracelet in a British Airways executive lounge. The court considered whether British Airways had possession or control of the bracelet.

HELD: The court decided that the company did not, but stated that if it had shown an intention to exercise control over the building and things in it, the company could have secured possession of the bracelet before the defendant found it. The court held that British Airways could have demonstrated this intention either expressly, for example by putting up a notice, or impliedly. However, in this case, it had shown no such intention. When the original owner did not come forward to claim the bracelet, it could be kept by the passenger.

An occupier of a building has rights superior to those of a finder of chattels in it, provided he has manifested an intention to exercise control over things which may be there. D, occupied as lessees, the executive lounge at an airways terminal. P found a gold bracelet on the floor of the lounge and handed it in, requesting that if the owner failed to claim it, it should be forwarded to him. No one claimed the bracelet; it was sold for GBP 850 by D who retained the proceeds. P was awarded GBP 850 plus interest.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that P's rights could only be displaced if D could show, as occupiers, an obvious intention to exercise control over all articles in the lounge such that the bracelet was in their possession before P found it (_[Bridges v Hawkesworth (1851) 21 L.J.
