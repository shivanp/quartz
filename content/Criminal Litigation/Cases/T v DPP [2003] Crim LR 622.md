# T v DPP [2003] Crim LR 622

## Summary

Extent of injury necessary to support case of actual bodily harm - Appellant kicked victim - Victim lost consciousness momentarily - Momentary loss of consciousness sufficient to make out case of actual bodily harm - Offences Against the Person Act 1871 s 47.

## Abstract

T appealed by way of case stated from his conviction for occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C0F52C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da441ed533b64ea6b4b98c70e55cf999&contextData=(sc.Default)). T was in a group that chased M. M fell to the ground and lost consciousness for a short time when he was kicked by T. T contended, in reliance on the decision in _[R. v Donovan (John George) [1934] 2 K.B. 498, [1934] 7 WLUK 52](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I423E87F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da441ed533b64ea6b4b98c70e55cf999&contextData=(sc.Default))_, that s.47 did not apply as M's short loss of consciousness was too transient to amount to actual bodily harm.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the words "actual bodily harm" were to be accorded their everyday meaning. Loss of consciousness amounted to an impairment of sensory function, therefore, M had suffered actual harm, Donovan considered, _[R. v Miller (Peter) [1954] 2 Q.B. 282, [1953] 12 WLUK 38](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5A399980E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da441ed533b64ea6b4b98c70e55cf999&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Chan-Fook (Mike) [1994] 1 W.L.R. 689, [1993] 10 WLUK 234](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3A1A0720E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da441ed533b64ea6b4b98c70e55cf999&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
