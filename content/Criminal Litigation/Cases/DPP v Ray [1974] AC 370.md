# DPP v Ray [1974] AC 370

In this case, it was implied from the respondent’s course of conduct that he would pay for his meal before leaving the restaurant, which was a false representation of his intention/ state of mind after he made the decision to leave without paying.

---

The conduct of a customer in a restaurant may be a continuing representation that he intends to pay; so that, if he changes that intention, the confirmation of such conduct is a deception within s. 16 (1) of the Theft Act 1968. Five young men entered a Chinese restaurant in Gainsborough and ordered a meal with the intention of paying for it. After the main course they decided not to pay after all, and, preserving the demeanour of ordinary customers for another ten minutes, ran out of the restaurant when the waiter had gone to the kitchen.

Held, that by preserving such a demeanour, the defendants had produced a deception as to their change of mind regarding payment of the bill; that the deception had produced the evasion of a debt in that they continued to be treated as persons who intended to pay, the waiter failing to take such precautions as he otherwise would have, and the defendants were guilty of an offence under s.16(1) of the Theft Act 1968. (Definition of “deception” in _[London and Globe Finance Corp (Winding Up), Re [1903] 1 Ch. 728, [1903] 3 WLUK 33](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE29E17C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6d9f5c3e84974d788c59292c0fabba56&contextData=(sc.Default))_ approved).
