# R v Taaffe [1983] 2 All ER 625

FACTS: Taaffe was caught importing illegal drugs into the United Kingdom. He thought the bag containing the drugs contained currency and he mistakenly thought that it was an offence to import this currency into the UK.

HELD: Taaffe could not be convicted of an attempt to import currency into the UK, because there is no such offence.

Where a person imports a prohibited substance A, believing it to be a prohibited substance B, mistakenly thinking a prohibition exists as against B, when in fact there is none, then he does not "knowingly" import substance A for the purposes of the [Customs and Excise Management Act 1979](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6038BB90E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=38e434d6bfbe46db846a934b240ebe81&contextData=(sc.Default)) . D pleaded not guilty to a count of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition of the importation of cannabis. The judge heard argument on agreed facts as to whether a defence was afforded, and ruled that it was not. The agreed facts were: that (1) D had agreed to import a prohibited substance; (2) the substance was cannabis; (3) D believed it was currency; (4) currency was not the subject of a prohibition; (5) D mistakenly believed it was the subject of a prohibition.

Held, allowing D's appeal, that although it was sufficient that D did not know the precise nature of the goods, he had to be judged against the facts as he believed them to be; and since no offence would have been committed if the goods were currency, his belief that he was committing an offence by importation of currency did not convert the importation into a criminal offence ( R. v.
