# DPP v Santana-Bermudez [2003] EWHC 2908

FACTS: The respondent was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (based on a battery). A police officer asked the respondent if he had any needles or 'sharps' on him. The respondent replied 'No'. The officer then searched the respondent's jacket pockets, where her finger was pierced by a hypodermic needle.

HELD: Although the respondent had not done an act which had directly caused the injury, the Divisional Court held that he had created a danger (by exposing the officer to a risk), which he had failed to avert. Battery was constituted by an omission.

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm can be committed by an omission. Although the respondent had not done an act which had directly caused the injury, the Divisional Court applied **_R v Roberts_** and **_R v Miller_** and held that he had created a danger (by exposing the officer to a risk), which he had failed to avert. Thus, the conviction was upheld.

> 'Where someone (by act or word or a combination of the two) creates a danger and thereby exposes another to a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury which materialises, there is an evidential basis for the _actus reus_ of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It remains necessary for the prosecution to prove an intention to assault or the appropriate recklessness.

(_Per_ Kay J.)

## Summary

Where a person, by act or word, created a danger and thereby exposed another to a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury which materialised, there was an evidential basis for the actus reus of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and it remained necessary for the prosecution to prove an intention to assault or the appropriate recklessness.

## Abstract

The DPP appealed by way of case stated against a decision of the Crown Court acceding to a submission of no case to answer in respect of an appeal against a conviction by the magistrates' court for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The alleged victim of the offence was a police officer, H, who had approached the accused, S, who was apparently operating as a ticket tout at an underground station. In the station supervisor's office H informed S that she intended to conduct a full body search. On request S emptied his pockets to reveal one or more syringes. H also asked S to pull out the linings of his jacket pockets, which he did with the exception of two small breast pockets that could not be pulled out. H asked S whether he possessed any needles or sharps and S replied that he did not. H commenced her search and put her fingers into one of the breast pockets, where her finger was pierced by a hypodermic needle. S removed another needle from a pocket in his trousers, shrugged his shoulders and smirked. The Crown Court had concluded that the evidence did not disclose a positive act committed by S and that an omission to act did not in law amount to an assault. The DPP contended that S had created a danger by putting the needle in his pocket; that this was compounded by his lying words of assurance that he had no needles or sharps on him; and that it was reasonably foreseeable that H would be injured.

Held, allowing the appeal, that where someone, by act or word or a combination of the two, created a danger and thereby exposed another to a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury that materialised, there was an evidential basis for the actus reus of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, although it remained necessary for the prosecution to prove an intention to assault or the appropriate recklessness, _[R. v Roberts (Kenneth Joseph) (1972) 56 Cr. App. R. 95, [1971] 10 WLUK 60](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I642DAA30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ca8b86492d0f4fcfafff8a5efaf3c01f&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[DPP v K (A Minor) [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1067, [1989] 10 WLUK 98](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AF3D720E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ca8b86492d0f4fcfafff8a5efaf3c01f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Miller (James) [1983] 2 A.C. 161, [1983] 3 WLUK 172](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5A370170E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ca8b86492d0f4fcfafff8a5efaf3c01f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. In the instant case, if, as the Crown Court had implicitly found, S, by giving H a dishonest assurance about the contents of his pockets, had thereby exposed her to a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury that materialised, it was wrong for the court to conclude there was no evidential basis for the actus reus of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Accordingly, the Crown Court was wrong to accede to the submission of no case to answer.
