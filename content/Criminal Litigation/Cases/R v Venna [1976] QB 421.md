# R v Venna [1976] QB 421

Mens rea in assault may consist either of intention to apply physical force, or recklessness. Per curiam: When enacting the [Public Order Act 1936](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60BD2DD0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=84fa2190432e4e7e8e2bcd1ffa3212e9&contextData=(sc.Default)) , the behaviour of the defendant and his friends was not the sort of incident that Parliament had in mind. D, together with other youths, was creating a disturbance. The youths were arrested. D struggled violently on arrest and fractured the hand of a police officer. He was convicted after a direction to the jury that recklessness in the use of force was sufficient to sustain a conviction of assault.

Held, dismissing D's appeal, that a reckless use of force was sufficient to satisfy the element of mens rea in a criminal assault.
