# R v H [2002] 1 Cr App R 7

## Summary

Where a father's defence to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was one of reasonable chastisement of his son, a jury had to be directed in accordance with the current state of the common law as it had developed in the light of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.

## Abstract

The Crown appealed under the [Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 s.35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C71AC20E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a33897aa77f49f9b03d35084ff83b6f&contextData=(sc.Default)) in relation to a judge's ruling following a preparatory hearing on the appropriate directions to be given to a jury. The Crown's case concerned an allegation that H had assaulted his son, causing him actual bodily harm. H's defence was that the use of a leather belt for disobedience was punishment he was entitled to use in the exercise of his rights as a parent. At the preparatory hearing, the Crown had contended that, in view of contemplated legislative changes which would be brought about as a result of the dicta in _[A v United Kingdom [1998] 2 F.L.R. 959, [1998] 9 WLUK 219](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I46F7E6C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a33897aa77f49f9b03d35084ff83b6f&contextData=(sc.Default))_, it was appropriate for the judge to direct the jury on the factors which were found to be of relevance in considering the reasonableness of the chastisement. Although the judge was minded to follow that course, he had indicated that such directions were not sufficient so as to protect the boy's rights not to be subject to inhuman or degrading treatment as contained in the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a33897aa77f49f9b03d35084ff83b6f&contextData=(sc.Default)) and further, such directions contravened s.6(1) of the 1998 Act.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) notwithstanding that the alleged offence had occurred before the implementation of the 1998 Act, it was appropriate for the judge to direct the jury in accordance with the current state of the common law as it had developed in the light of the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, _[R. v R [1992] 1 A.C. 599, [1991] 10 WLUK 315](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I613A33C0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a33897aa77f49f9b03d35084ff83b6f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. Those authorities indicated that for the punishment to contravene Art.3, considerations of severity and reasonableness were of relevance, _[Tyrer v United Kingdom (A/26) (1979-80) 2 E.H.R.R. 1, [1978] 4 WLUK 119](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF5D4F30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a33897aa77f49f9b03d35084ff83b6f&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Y v United Kingdom (14229/88) (1994) 17 E.H.R.R. 238, [1992] 10 WLUK 385](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I11488B90E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a33897aa77f49f9b03d35084ff83b6f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Costello-Roberts v United Kingdom (13134/87) [1994] 1 F.C.R. 65, [1993] 3 WLUK 388](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8EE4D5B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a33897aa77f49f9b03d35084ff83b6f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered;

(2) it was appropriate for the judge to direct the jury having regard to those factors which were identified in A v United Kingdom namely the nature, context and duration of H's behaviour, the physical and mental consequences to his son, his son's age and H's reasons for administering the chastisement, and

(3) the object of the directions to the jury was to achieve a balance between maintaining the rights of the boy under Art.3, H's rights to a fair trial under Art.6 and his rights under Art.7 not to be punished for an act which did not constitute a criminal offence.
