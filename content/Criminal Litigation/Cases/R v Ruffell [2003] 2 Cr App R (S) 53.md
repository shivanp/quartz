# R v Ruffell [2003] 2 Cr App R (S) 53

In this case R had supplied drugs to the victim who had clearly suffered a severe adverse reaction to the drugs. R did various things, such as putting the V in a cold bath, to try to revive him. The next day R rang the V’s mother and said he was going to work, and she would find her son outside R’s house. The mother asked R to bring V in and cover him with a blanket. R agreed, but left V outside. It was very cold weather and V died from a combination of hypothermia and the drugs.

The Court of Appeal, in reviewing the sentence, found that the defendant had breached a duty of care towards the victim even though it is not clear from the judgment on what basis the duty arose. It could have been that R had voluntarily assumed a duty or care, or it could have been that R had created a dangerous situation as in **_R v Miller_**.

R appealed against his three year custodial sentence imposed for an offence of manslaughter through gross negligence. The victim had injected heroin at R's house and had become unwell. R made attempts to revive him that night, but early the following morning the victim was still unwell. R put him outside the house and left him there while he went back inside and fell asleep. The victim was later found dead, the cause of death being identified as hypothermia and opiate intoxication.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the sentence was manifestly excessive, despite the fact that the offence had involved a direct act and/or omission and that R had deliberately left the victim, who had clearly been unwell, outside in cold weather when he could easily have brought him inside. Accordingly a term of two years was substituted, _[R. v Crow (Alistair) [2001] EWCA Crim 2968, [2002] 2 Cr. App. R.
