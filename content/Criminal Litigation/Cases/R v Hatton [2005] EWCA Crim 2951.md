# R v Hatton [2005] EWCA Crim 2951

FACTS: H had drunk over 20 pints of beer and killed the victim with a sledgehammer. He had been convicted of murder. The victim had been pretending to be a member of the SAS and a stick, owned by H and which H had fashioned to look like a samuri sword, was found by the victim’s body. H said he had only a vague recollection of what had happened, but put forward a defence on the basis that he believed he was being attacked by an SAS officer with a sword.

HELD: The Court of Appeal applied **_R v O’Connor_**and the earlier case of **_R v O’Grady_** and held that the mistake that he was being attacked by a sword had been induced by the defendant’s intoxication so could not be relied upon.

## Summary

The decision in R v O'Grady (1987) QB 995 that where a defendant sought to establish the defence of self defence it was not open to him to rely on a mistake induced by voluntary intoxication, applied equally to cases of manslaughter and murder.

## Abstract

The appellant (H) appealed against his conviction for murder.

H, who had consumed a large quantity of alcohol and was heavily intoxicated at the time of the killing, had argued that in determining the reasonableness of his actions consideration should have been given to the effect of his intoxication upon his perception of the situation. The trial judge ruled that H could not rely upon the effect of self induced intoxication to establish that he was acting reasonably at the time.

H argued that the jury should have been directed to consider whether H's intoxication might have led him to mistake the severity of any attack to which he may have been subjected by the victim.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

A mistaken belief caused by self induced intoxication could not be relied upon to establish that H was acting in self defence, _[R. v O'Grady (Patrick Gerald) [1987] Q.B. 995, [1987] 6 WLUK 125](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5F7419C0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a604c8e452584316874987dc8c350ba3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. In any event, the evidence as to the extent of any attack by the victim on H was questionable and the judge had properly doubted whether self defence was an option for the jury to consider. In the end, the jury had decided to convict after being asked to consider whether they were sure that H had used unreasonable force having regard to the circumstances as he believed them to be.
