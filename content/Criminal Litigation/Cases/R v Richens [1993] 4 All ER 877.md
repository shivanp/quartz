# R v Richens [1993] 4 All ER 877

## Abstract

A direction to the effect that provocation requires a complete loss of control to the extent that an accused does not know what he is doing is a misdirection. R, a student aged 17, killed another student who had allegedly raped his girlfriend. The incident took place two weeks after the rape. R confronted the victim and, becoming enraged at the suggestion that the girl was a willing party, stabbed the deceased. When questioned by police he denied involvement but later admitted responsibility. The issue at his trial was whether the offence was murder or manslaughter by reason of provocation. The verdict was murder. The appeal was on the basis of misdirection on provocation.

Held, allowing the appeal and substituting manslaughter, that provocation required a sudden and temporary loss of control, resulting in the defendant being unable to restrain himself from doing what he did; the judge had gone too far in requiring complete loss of control to the extent that the defendant did not know what he was doing (_[R. v Duffy [1949] 1 All E.R. 932, [1949] 4 WLUK 6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I86379F10E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8434ba9d112d4f029800efe2ea0acf4c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[R. v Thornton (Sara Elizabeth) (No.1) [1992] 1 All E.R. 306, [1991] 7 WLUK 373](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6E2A1F50E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8434ba9d112d4f029800efe2ea0acf4c&contextData=(sc.Default))_, R. v Ahluwalia [1992] C.L.Y. 1094 considered).
