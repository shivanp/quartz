# Reed v Wastie [1972] Crim LR 221

The plaintiff, who had become abusive and violent after being checked by police for a parking offence, was arrested and handcuffed.

Held, on the evidence,

(1) that the police had used only reasonable force in removing the plaintiff from a dangerous position on the highway; but

(2) that one of the constables had struck the plaintiff and broken his nose after he had been handcuffed and (despite gross provocation by the plaintiff) this was an inexcusable assault for which the plaintiff was entitled to damages of GBP 275.
