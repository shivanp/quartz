# R v Miller [1983] 2 AC 161

FACTS: Miller, a squatter, fell asleep in a bed whilst holding a lighted cigarette. He awoke to find the mattress smouldering. He realised it was his cigarette that had caused the fire, but all he did was to move to another room and go to sleep again. The house was damaged by fire.

HELD: Miller was convicted of arson (Criminal Damage Act 1971, s 1(1) and s 1(3)).

The House of Lords held that if someone inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that causes the risk of damage, and that person becomes aware of what is happening, and he can prevent further damage, his inaction or omission to do so can become an actus reus of criminal damage. Lord Diplock said:

> 'I see no rational ground for excluding from conduct capable of giving rise to criminal liability, conduct which consists of failing to take measures that lie within one's power to counteract a danger that one has oneself created, if at the time of such conduct one's state of mind is such as constitutes a necessary ingredient of the offence.â€™
