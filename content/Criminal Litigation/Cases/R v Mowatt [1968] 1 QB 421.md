# R v Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421

In certain circumstances it is unnecessary to deal specifically in the summing up with the meaning of the word "maliciously" in the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8a38fae18c314480bfeeafffcf7994dd&contextData=(sc.Default)) . The accused was charged with wounding with intent (contrary to s.18 of the 1861 Act) but was convicted of the alternative offence of unlawful wounding (contrary to s.20 of the 1861 Act). He appealed against conviction on the ground that in the course of his summing-up the trial judge did not deal specifically with the meaning of the word "maliciously" in s.20.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that where the evidence for the prosecution, if accepted, showed that the physical act of the accused which caused the injury to another person was a direct assault which any ordinary person would be bound to realise was likely to cause some physical harm to the other person, and the defence put forward on behalf of the accused was not that the assault was accidental or that he did not realise that it might cause some physical harm to the victim, but is some other defence such as that he did not do the alleged act or that he did it in self-defence, it is unnecessary to deal specifically in the summing up with what is meant by the word "maliciously" in the section.
