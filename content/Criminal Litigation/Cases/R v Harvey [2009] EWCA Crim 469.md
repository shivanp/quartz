# R v Harvey [2009] EWCA Crim 469

## Summary

Criticisms of a judge's summing up to the jury in a case involving the defence of self defence were, on the facts, unfounded and served only to demonstrate the erroneous belief that all the elements of self defence were relevant in every case and must always be mechanically recited to the jury. Directions had to be tailored to the factual dispute in question, and in the instant case, it had not been relevant to draw the jury's attention to the defendant's perceptions of the facts.

## Abstract

The appellant (H) appealed against her conviction of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

H had bitten the complainant (M) on the nose during a drunken fight in the road outside a taxi office. A CCTV film had recorded the two women fighting and pulling each other's hair. It had shown them both on the ground in a scuffle, but it did not show the bite. H had maintained at trial that she had bitten M's nose in self defence when she had been pinned to the ground with M on top of her. She explained how she had been struggling to breathe and needed to find a way of getting M off her. M had asserted that she had been the one lying on the ground underneath H and that the bite had not therefore been in self defence. The judge had directed the jury as to the meaning of assault. He had advised the jury that if it was sure that H was the aggressor or had deliberately provoked the attack, then self defence did not arise unless the violence offered by the victim was "so out of proportion to [H's] attack that she [H] honestly believed she was in immediate danger and had no other means of escape". He had told the jury that if H did not honestly believe that it was necessary to use force to defend herself, she could not have been acting in self defence. Finally, the judge had applied his directions of law to the facts.

H submitted that (1) in directing the jury that self defence did not apply unless the victim's actions were so out of proportion that the defendant honestly believed she was in immediate danger, the judge had reversed the burden of proof; (2) the judge's directions to the jury had been confused, unnecessarily lengthy, convoluted and confusing; (3) the judge had failed to direct the jury that it was required to assess the reasonableness of H's actions on the basis of the facts as she honestly believed them to be.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The judge had not reversed the burden of proof. He had explained to the jury why he used the word "unless", namely because he wanted to steer the jury away from the erroneous belief that if H was the initial aggressor, she could not rely on self defence at all. He had used the word "unless" to emphasise that in circumstances where the tables had been turned, a defendant could still rely on the defence of self defence, _[R. v Rashford (Nicholas) [2005] EWCA Crim 3377, [2006] Crim. L.R. 547, [2005] 12 WLUK 352](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I61649F21E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e6d97d53eb96459cbca31480d366a8b6&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.

(2) The sense of the directions had to be judged by the thrust of the summing up as a whole and not by analysis of isolated extracts. On the facts of the instant case, the judge's directions to the jury could have been confined to the consequences of the rival factual versions of the circumstances in which M had been bitten, pointing out that the prosecution could either prove that H had been on top of M or it couldn't. If it couldn't prove that H had been on the top, the direction to the jury should have asked it to consider whether it may have been reasonable for H to bite M's nose, even allowing for stress and urgency at the moment of decision. However, although the direction could have been far simpler and confined to the factual dispute, it did not follow that the jury had been misled by the confusing nature of the summing up. The direction had perhaps been a bit long, but it was neither confused nor confusing. (3) H's perception of the circumstances had little to do with the issue in the case, which was whether she had bitten M while on top of her or not. The jury's decision had not required any conclusion regarding H's honest belief, but rather a conclusion as to the circumstances of the bite. H's argument demonstrated the erroneous belief that in every case of self defence, all the elements were always relevant and must always be mechanically recited to the jury; the directions in law needed to do no more than guide the jury as to what the essential factual dispute was and the conclusions to be drawn from the different findings open to them on the evidence, _[Shaw (Norman) v Queen, The [2001] UKPC 26, [2001] 1 W.L.R. 1519, [2001] 5 WLUK 618](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA7612FC0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e6d97d53eb96459cbca31480d366a8b6&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and the commentary by Professor Ormerod in Rashford applied.
