# R v Dyson (1908)

FACTS: This was at a time before anti-biotics and when meningitis was not curable. The victim, a child, had meningitis. Dyson threw her down the stairs and she died. It was argued that the child was going to die in any event, and the actions of the defendant had not caused death.

HELD: Any action which accelerates death is a cause.
