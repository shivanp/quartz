# Jaggard v Dickinson [1980] Crim LR 717 (QBD)

FACTS: Dickinson broke a window in the drunken belief that the house was that of a friend with whom she was staying.

HELD: The court confirmed that the test was subjective. Applying the CDA 1971, s 5(3), the court held that Dickinson was entitled to the defence under the CDA 1971, s 5(2)(a), irrespective of whether the belief was reasonable, even, as here, where it resulted from the defendant's intoxication.
