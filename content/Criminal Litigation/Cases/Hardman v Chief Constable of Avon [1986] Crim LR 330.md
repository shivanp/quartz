# Hardman v Chief Constable of Avon [1986] Crim LR 330

The defendants had painted silhouettes on a pavement in whitewash as part of a demonstration against Hiroshima. The Local Authority had employed a ‘graffiti squad’ to clean the pavements, despite the fact that the pictures would eventually have been washed away by the rain.

The court held this to be damage as damage need not be permanent. It was relevant that time, effort and money had been spent in restoring the pavement to its original state.
