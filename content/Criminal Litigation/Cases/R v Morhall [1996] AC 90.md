# R v Morhall [1996] AC 90

## Abstract

M, who was addicted to solvents, was convicted of murder after killing a man in the course of a fight which arose after the victim had rebuked him for glue sniffing. The judge directed the jury that when they considered the effect of the victim's provocation on a reasonable man under the [Homicide Act 1957 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I780A4C51E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a937084bb7e24fef9d3d7bd23b0e1152&contextData=(sc.Default)) they had to exclude M's solvent addiction. M appealed on the basis that his addiction was a relevant characteristic to be taken into account when considering the gravity of the provocation.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) M's glue sniffing was a characteristic of particular relevance to the provocation in the instant case, _[R. v Camplin (Paul) [1978] A.C. 705, [1978] 4 WLUK 22](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39B44070E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a937084bb7e24fef9d3d7bd23b0e1152&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. The jury did not have to be directed in the same words prescribed by the model direction in Camplin provided that they were directed according to the law and facts of the case. Their task was to consider the effect of the provoking words on a person with the ordinary amount of self control who had the defendant's characteristics, history and circumstances insofar as the jury thought those would affect the gravity of the provocation;

(2) the fact that a characteristic of the defendant was discreditable did not exclude it from consideration. Solvent addiction could not be excluded on the grounds that it was incompatible with a reasonable man. If a defendant lacked self control when the provocation was offered because of the effects of intoxication, that characteristic should be excluded on policy grounds. In the instant case, the direction failed to make clear whether glue sniffing was relevant to the reasonable man test or to the question of whether M lost self control because of the provocation. The verdict would be quashed and a manslaughter verdict substituted.
