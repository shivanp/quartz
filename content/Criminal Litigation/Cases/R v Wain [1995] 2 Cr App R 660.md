# R v Wain [1995] 2 Cr App R 660

FACTS: The defendant raised money in a telethon for a charity. He deposited the monies into a separate bank account, but when asked for the proceeds by the charity organisers he made excuses not to hand the money over and obtained permission to pay it into his own bank account. He then handed cheques drawn on his own account to the organisers, but these were not met. At the same time, he was withdrawing money from the account for his own use.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held:

> '[B]y virtue of section 5(3), the appellant was plainly under an obligation to retain, if not the actual notes and coins, at least their proceeds, that is to say the money credited in the bank account which he opened for the trust with the actual property. When he took the money credited to that account and moved it over to his own bank account, it was still the proceeds of the notes and coins donated which he proceeded to use for his own purposes, thereby appropriating them.â€™

Held: W's submission of no case to answer under the [Theft Act 1968 s.5](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6753C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b986801f57a540ada0d19e88eb8256f9&contextData=(sc.Default)) was rightly rejected by the trial judge, because a person who collected money for charity was subject to an obligation in respect of the money or its proceeds, that is, to give it to the charity. _[Lewis v Lethbridge [1987] Crim. L.R. 59, [1986] 6 WLUK 59](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70160870E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b986801f57a540ada0d19e88eb8256f9&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered, _[Davidge v Bunnett [1984] Crim. L.R. 297, [1984] 1 WLUK 1168](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I59195410E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b986801f57a540ada0d19e88eb8256f9&contextData=(sc.Default))_ preferred. The appeal was dismissed.
