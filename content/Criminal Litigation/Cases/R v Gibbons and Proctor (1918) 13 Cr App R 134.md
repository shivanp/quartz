# R v Gibbons and Proctor (1918) 13 Cr App R 134

FACTS: Gibbons lived with his girlfriend, Proctor, together with his child, Nelly, and Proctor's children from a previous relationship. Gibbons gave Proctor money for food for the family. Proctor deliberately starved Nelly to death.

HELD: The Court of Appeal noted that Gibbons was living in the same house as Nelly. It said he must have been aware of the condition of his daughter, who was little more than a skeleton when she died. If he did not see her, then that is evidence from which the jury could have decided he did not care what was happening to her and had the _mens rea_ for murder. Gibbons was convicted of his daughter's murder based on breach of his duty as a father not to neglect her.

HELD: Edith Proctor was also convicted of Nelly’s murder, on the basis that Proctor was living in the same household, in the role of Gibbons’ _de facto_ wife. She was looking after ‘the family’ while Gibbons went out to work, and received money for housekeeping and food from Gibbons.
