# R v Kennedy [2007] 3 WLR 612

Kennedy supplied a dose of heroin in a syringe, which he handed to the victim, who injected himself, and almost immediately suffered an adverse reaction. The victim later died of the consequences of intoxication by opiates and alcohol. Kennedy was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter and his conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal on two separate occasions.

The question certified by the Court of Appeal for the consideration of the House following Kennedy's second appeal was as follows:

> [!question]
> 'When is it appropriate to find someone guilty of manslaughter where that person has been involved in the supply of a class A controlled drug, which is then freely and voluntarily self-administered by the person to whom it was supplied, and the administration of the drug then causes his death?’

The answer given by the House of Lords was emphatic:

> 'In the case of a fully-informed and responsible adult, never.' (_Per_ Lord Bingham.)

Lord Bingham amplified this comment in the context of the issue of causation:

> 'The criminal law generally assumes the existence of free will. The law recognises certain exceptions, in the case of the young, those who for any reason are not fully responsible for their actions, and the vulnerable, and it acknowledges situations of duress and necessity, as also of deception and mistake. But, generally speaking, informed adults of sound mind are treated as autonomous beings able to make their own decisions how they will act, and none of the exceptions is relied on as possibly applicable in this case. Thus D is not to be treated as causing V to act in a certain way if V makes a voluntary and informed decision to act in that way rather than another.

In this case, the heroin is described as “freely and voluntarily self-administered” by the deceased. This, on the facts, is an inevitable finding. The appellant supplied the heroin and prepared the syringe. But the deceased had a choice whether to inject himself or not. He chose to do so, knowing what he was doing. It was his act.'

## Summary

The supplier of a Class A controlled drug would not be guilty of manslaughter if the person to whom the drug was supplied freely and voluntarily self-administered it.

## Abstract

The appellant (K) appealed against a decision (_[[2005] EWCA Crim 685, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 2159](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I51035A91E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8293fae7595444808e39e2bc16c65b22&contextData=(sc.Default))_) upholding his conviction for manslaughter.

K and the deceased (B) both lived in a hostel. K visited the room in which B was staying, was told by B that he wanted "a bit to make him sleep", prepared a dose of heroin and gave B a syringe ready for injection. B injected himself and returned the empty syringe to K, who left the room. B later died, the cause of death being the inhalation of gastric contents while acutely intoxicated by opiates and alcohol. The Court of Appeal certified the following question for the opinion of the House: "When is it appropriate to find someone guilty of manslaughter where that person has been involved in the supply of a class A controlled drug, which is then freely and voluntarily self-administered by the person to whom it was supplied, and the administration of the drug then causes his death?".

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) To establish the crime of unlawful act manslaughter, it had to be shown, among other things, that the defendant had committed an unlawful act, that such unlawful act was a crime, and that the act had been a significant cause of the death of the deceased. The parties to the appeal were agreed that an unlawful act on the present facts had to be found, if at all, in a breach of the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BFCDC30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8293fae7595444808e39e2bc16c65b22&contextData=(sc.Default)). The substance of the section created three distinct offences, namely administering a noxious thing to any other person, causing a noxious thing to be administered to any other person, and causing a noxious thing to be taken by any other person. The Crown had accepted that, if it could not show that K had committed the first of those offences, it could not hope to show the commission of the second or third offences. That concession had been rightly made, and it was appropriate to explain why. The criminal law generally assumed the existence of free will and, subject to certain exceptions, informed adults of sound mind were treated as autonomous beings able to make their own decisions on how to act. Thus a defendant was not to be treated as causing the victim to act in a certain way if the victim made a voluntary and informed decision to act in that way rather than another. The finding in the instant case that B had freely and voluntarily administered the injection to himself, knowing what it was, was fatal to any contention that K had caused the heroin to be administered to B or taken by him, _[R. v Finlay (Paul Anthony) [2003] EWCA Crim 3868, [2003] 12 WLUK 173](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I438DEB50E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8293fae7595444808e39e2bc16c65b22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled. Further, K had not administered the injection to B. The essential ratio of the decision of the Court of Appeal was that the administration of the injection had been a joint activity of K and B acting together. Although it was possible to imagine factual scenarios in which two people could properly be regarded as acting together to administer an injection, nothing of the kind had occurred here. K supplied the drug to B, who then had a choice, knowing the facts, whether to inject himself or not. The heroin had been self-administered, not jointly administered, _[R. v Rogers (Stephen) [2003] EWCA Crim 945, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 1374, [2003] 3 WLUK 389](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6464BFC0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8293fae7595444808e39e2bc16c65b22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled. In the circumstances, the answer to the certified question was: "In the case of a fully informed and responsible adult, never".

(2) (Obiter) Much of the difficulty and doubt which had dogged the present question had flowed from a failure, at the outset, to identify the unlawful act on which the manslaughter count was founded. It mattered little whether the act was identified by a separate count or counts under s.23, or by particularisation of the manslaughter count itself. But it would focus attention on the correct question, and promote accurate analysis of the real issues, if those who formulated, defended and ruled on serious charges of this kind were obliged to consider how exactly, in law, the accusation was put.
