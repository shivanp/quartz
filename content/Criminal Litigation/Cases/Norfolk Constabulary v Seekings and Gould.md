# Norfolk Constabulary v Seekings and Gould

FACTS: In this case, two similar containers, still on their wheeled chassis, positioned at the rear of a supermarket and used for temporary storage.

HELD. They were not buildings even though electricity was laid on. The only way that burglary could be committed would be if they were inhabited.
