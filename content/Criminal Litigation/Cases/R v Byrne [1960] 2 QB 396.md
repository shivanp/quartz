# R v Byrne [1960] 2 QB 396

## Abstract

Per curiam: "Abnormality of mind," within the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=80d41ab1decf4197973f7fb4cfae1db2&contextData=(sc.Default)) , which has to be contrasted with the expression in the rules in R. v. M'Naughten "defect of reason," means a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal. It is wide enough to cover the mind's activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters, and the ability to form a rational judgment as to whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise will power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment. The expression "mental responsibility for his acts" points to a consideration of the extent to which the accused's mind is answerable for his physical acts, which must include a consideration of the extent of his ability to exercise will power to control his physical acts. B. killed a young woman and was charged with murder. His defence was that he was suffering from diminished responsibility within the meaning of s.2 of the Homicide Act, 1957. The medical evidence was that B. was a sexual psychopath and that he could be described as partially insane. Stable J. directed the jury that if they found only that B. suffered from perverse sexual urges which were impossible or very difficult to resist, that would not bring the case within the section.

Held, allowing an appeal against a conviction of murder and substituting a verdict of manslaughter, inability to exercise will power would, and difficulty in doing so might, come within the section, and that the judge's direction had therefore removed from the jury an essential question of fact.
