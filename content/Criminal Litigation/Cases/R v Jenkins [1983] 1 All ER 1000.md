# R v Jenkins [1983] 1 All ER 1000

The Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, held that the offence of burglary by entering a building as a trespasser and by inflicting grievous bodily harm on a person contrary to [s 9(1)(b)](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251968_60a_SECT_9%25&A=0.13970324656887168&backKey=20_T495463445&service=citation&ersKey=23_T495463436&langcountry=GB) of the Theft Act 1968 did not necessarily involve an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the victim within [s 47](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251861_100a_SECT_47%25&A=0.3239688185291937&backKey=20_T495463445&service=citation&ersKey=23_T495463436&langcountry=GB) of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Applying the construction of the similar phrase in s 20b of the 1861 Act, the phrase ‘inflict grievous bodily harm’ in s 9(1)(b) of the 1968 Act was to be construed widely and not in the restricted sense of necessarily involving an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It followed that where the charge against the accused was one of burglary contrary to s 9(1)(b) of the 1968 Act, the allegations in the charge did not amount to or include an allegation of the lesser offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Thus, a jury was entitled to return a verdict of guilty of the lesser offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The court considered the application of the section on alternative verdicts available to juries on a trial for attempted murder. The allegations in a charge under section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 or under section 9(1)(b) of the Theft Act 1968 impliedly included allegations of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and accordingly, on a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the 1861 Act or on a charge of burglary contrary to section 9(1)(b) of the 1968 Act, it was open to the jury to return a verdict of not guilty as charged, but guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 47 of the 1861 Act, notwithstanding the absence of an assault: ‘there can be an infliction of grievous bodily harm contrary to s.20 without an assault being committed’. The House also set out the essential elements of the crime of conspiracy.  

Lord Roskill observed:

> ‘In the present case, the issue to my mind is not whether the allegations in the section 20 charge, expressly or impliedly, amount to an allegation of a section 47 charge, for plainly they do not. The issue is whether they ‘either expressly or impliedly’ include such an allegation. The answer to that question is what is expressly or impliedly included in a charge of inflicting bodily harm.’
