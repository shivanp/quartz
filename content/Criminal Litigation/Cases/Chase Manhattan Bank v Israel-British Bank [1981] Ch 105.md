# Chase Manhattan Bank v Israel-British Bank [1981] Ch 105

A person who paid another moneys under a mistake of fact is entitled to trace and recover that mistaken payment since he retains an equitable property in it and the payee is under a fiduciary duty to respect that continuing proprietary interest. The plaintiff, a New York bank, was instructed to pay US USD 2m. to another New York bank to the account of the defendants. The sum was paid, but later in the day a second payment was made due to a clerical error. The defendants were wound up and the plaintiffs could not recover the whole sum without claiming a declaration that the defendants received the moneys as trustees for the plaintiffs, thus entitling them to trace the mistaken payment. At trial, it was agreed that the mistaken payment was governed by the law of the State of New York but the procedural rights and remedies had to be ascertained by the laws of England.

Held, the plaintiffs were entitled to trace and recover the mistaken payment on the grounds, that

(1) under English law the payer of a mistaken payment retained an equitable property in it and the payee was subjected to a fiduciary duty to respect that continuing proprietary interest;

(2) on the evidence, a similar equitable interest exists under the laws of New York State;

(3) the moneys in the defendant's hands at the commencement of the winding up did not belong to the defendants beneficially and never formed part of its property.
