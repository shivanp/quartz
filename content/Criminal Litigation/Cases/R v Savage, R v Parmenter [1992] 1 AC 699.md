# R v Savage, R v Parmenter [1992] 1 AC 699

A verdict of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is a permissible alternative on a count alleging unlawful wounding contrary to the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b05e1cd4ff414eedae6bc612807d66c7&contextData=(sc.Default)) . To establish an offence under s.20 the prosecution must prove either that the defendant intended or that he actually foresaw that his act would cause physical harm to some person, albeit only of a minor character. D1 was convicted of unlawful wounding contrary to s.20 of the 1861 Act. On appeal the Court of Appeal held that the direction to the jury was defective in that it omitted that the jury had to find that D foresaw that some physical harm would follow as a result of what he did. The jury then substituted a verdict of guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s.47. D2 was convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to s.20. On appeal the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had misdirected the jury by directing them to ask themselves whether D ought to have foreseen that his acts would cause injury, and that it was not possible to substitute a verdict under s.47 since that offence required subjective intent.

Held, dismissing D1's appeal and allowing the Crown's appeal in respect of D2, that

(1) a verdict of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was a permissible alternative verdict on a count alleging unlawful wounding contrary to s.20;

(2) a verdict of assault occasioning actual bodily harm might be returned merely upon proof of an assault and of the fact that actual bodily harm was occasioned thereby ( _[R. v Wilson (Clarence George) [1984] A.C. 242, [1983] 10 WLUK 98](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7424BB40E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b05e1cd4ff414eedae6bc612807d66c7&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed; _[R. v Roberts (Kenneth Joseph) (1972) 56 Cr.
