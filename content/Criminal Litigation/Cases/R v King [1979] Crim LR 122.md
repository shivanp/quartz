# R v King [1979] Crim LR 122

A second-hand car dealer who stated that the mileage reading on a particular car 'may not be correctâ€™ impliedly represented that he was not certain the reading was wrong when in fact he knew it was wrong as he had altered it.

K altered odometer readings on motor cars for sale to give false readings but displayed notices on them stating that the reading may not be correct. K pleaded guilty to one count of applying a false trade description to a motor car and one count of obtaining money by deception in relation to each motor car.
