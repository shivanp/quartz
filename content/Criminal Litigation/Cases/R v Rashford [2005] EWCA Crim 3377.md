# R v Rashford [2005] EWCA Crim 3377

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that self-defence is not automatically precluded in a situation where the defendant was the initial aggressor and the victim retaliated.

The success of the defence would depend upon the circumstances of the case. The court made it clear that self-defence is available to the person who started the fight if the person whom they attack not only defends themselves but goes over to the offensive. It would then be for the jury to decide whether or not the defendant honestly believed that it was necessary for them to use force to defend themselves and whether the amount of force they used was reasonable.
