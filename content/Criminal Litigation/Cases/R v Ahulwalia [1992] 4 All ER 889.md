# R v Ahulwalia [1992] 4 All ER 889

## Abstract

A had suffered violence and abuse from her husband over a long period. After one evening during which she had been threatened A went to bed, but thinking about her husband's behaviour was unable to sleep. She went downstairs, poured petrol into a bucket, lit a candle, then returned and set fire to her husband's bedroom. He died from his injuries. At A's trial the defence pleaded manslaughter on the grounds that she had not intended to kill him, only to inflict pain. Provocation was pleaded as a second line of defence based on her ill treatment throughout the marriage, but she was convicted of murder. A appealed.

Held: Appeal allowed. The classic definition of provocation as "a sudden and temporary loss of control", R. v Duffy [1949] 1 All E.R. 932, was still good law. The defence argued that the phrase might have led the jury to presume that provocation could only be pleaded if the act followed immediately from the alleged provocation, and as A had had time for deliberation the defence could not stand. However, particularly in the case of abused wives, the act could be the result of a "slowburn" reaction rather than an immediate loss of self control and the jury should have been directed accordingly. Their Lordships held that the judge's direction had been correct in that he left the issue to the jury to decide. The appeal succeeded on the question of diminished responsibility which the defence had failed to raise at the trial, despite the availability of a medical report that A was suffering from a depressive disorder at the time. In the light of this the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and the case should be submitted for retrial.
