# R v Woodman [1974] 2 All ER 955

The Court of Appeal held that, because the factory owners had taken steps to exclude trespassers, there was evidence that they were in control of the factory and thereby had control of the scrap metal, which, unknown to them, had been left inside the factory.

Control of a site by excluding others from it is prima facie "control" of articles on the site within the meaning of the [Theft Act 1968 s.5(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6753C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=642c489261fd43d28c74f8675ae5e47d&contextData=(sc.Default)) .

Per curiam: Where articles of some serious crucial consequence such as explosives or drugs are introduced to the site in circumstances in which the occupier had no means of knowledge a different result would be produced from that which arises under the general presumption. W was charged with theft of scrap metal from a disused site which had been fenced to exclude trespassers. The occupier had no knowledge of the existence of the scrap. The recorder allowed the case to go to the jury despite W's submission that the scrap did not belong to another within the meaning of the Theft Act 1968 s.5(1). W was convicted and appealed.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that it was immaterial that the occupier had no knowledge of the existence of the scrap and the case had been rightly left to the jury.
