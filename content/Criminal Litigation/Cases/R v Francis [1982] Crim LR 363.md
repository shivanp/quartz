# R v Francis [1982] Crim LR 363

FACTS: Ds, who were armed with sticks, were allowed by V to enter after they noisily demanded entry. They then discarded their sticks and subsequently stole articles in the house.

HELD: Their convictions for aggravated burglary were quashed; they may have entered with weapons of offence, but there was no evidence that at the point of entry they intended to steal.
