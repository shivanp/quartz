# R v Stones [1989] 89 Cr App R 26

FACTS: The defendant was seen running away from a house which had just been burgled. He had a knife in his possession. He claimed he had to for selfdefence.

HELD: The phrase 'intended by the person having it with him for such use' does not impose a requirement to prove that the intended use was with respect to the particular burglary.

On a charge of aggravated burglary the prosecution must prove that the defendant knowingly had the knife with him, with the intent to cause injury to some person, but need not show that he intended to use it in the course of the burglary. S was caught running away from a house that had been burgled. When arrested and searched, he was found to be carrying a kitchen knife, which he claimed was for self-defence. The judge directed the jury that it was sufficient for conviction under s.10 of the [Theft Act 1968 s.10](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6B4B61E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bb06f7cd3ba747c8b1bf3c6861e65f3d&contextData=(sc.Default)), if the prosecution proved that S was carrying a weapon of offence during the burglary with the intention of using it on some person.

Held, on appeal against conviction, that the appeal would be dismissed.
