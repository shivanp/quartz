# R v Smith [1974] QB 354

FACTS: Smith, who lived in rented accommodation with his brother, had installed electrical wiring to connect a stereo system. He had also, with his brother's help and the landlord's permission, put down floorboards, wall panels and roofing material. After two years, Smith decided to vacate the flat and asked permission for his brother to remain: the landlord declined. After this, Smith smashed the wall panels, floorboards and roofing material, doing so he said to gain access to the wiring that he had fitted, in order to remove it. He was found guilty.

HELD: The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed his conviction (_per_ James LJ).

> 'Construing the language of s 1(1) we have no doubt that the _actus reus_ is “destroying or damaging any property belonging to another”. It is not possible to exclude the words “belonging in another” which describe the “property”. Applying the ordinary principles of _mens rea_, the intention and recklessness and the absence of lawful excuse required to constitute the offence have reference to property belonging to another. It follows that in our judgment no offence is committed under this section if a person destroys or causes damage to property belonging to another if he does so in the honest though mistaken belief that the property is his own, and provided that the belief is honestly held it is irrelevant to consider whether or not it is a justifiable belief.'

FACTS: Smith was the tenant of a flat. He installed a stereo system and, with the consent of the landlady, added some roof and wall panels to hide the wiring. These, being affixed to the building, became the property of the landlady. Not knowing about this law, and believing them to be his own property, Smith damaged the panels when he removed his stereo system.

HELD: The Court of Appeal quashed his conviction because he did not intentionally or recklessly damage property belonging to another as required by the Criminal Damage Act 1971.
