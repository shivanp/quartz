# Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 1 QB 439

FACTS: Fagan accidentally drove onto a policeman's foot. The policeman asked him to move off his foot, but Fagan put the handbrake on and refused to do so. He was charged with assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty. At the time of driving onto the foot, which was the _actus reus_ of the crime, he did not have the _mens rea_.

HELD: However, the Divisional Court held that the assault involved a battery and this battery continued after the car came to rest. The _actus reus_ was a continuing act, and it was enough that Fagan had the _mens rea_ at some time during its continuance.
