# Logdon v DPP [1976] Crim LR 121

FACTS: The defendant showed the victim a pistol in a drawer, saying that it was loaded and declaring that he would hold her hostage. The defendant alone knew that the gun was a replica and unloaded, but his actions and words caused the victim to believe otherwise.

HELD: The defendant was found to have committed an assault against the victim.

**If the victim is caused to apprehend such a threat, it is irrelevant that the defendant does not in fact have the means to carry out that threat.**
