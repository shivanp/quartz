# R v Williams and Davis [1992] 1 WLR 380

FACTS: The appellants gave a lift to a hitch-hiker and tried to rob the hitch-hiker at knifepoint. The victim jumped from the moving car and died of head injuries.

HELD: The appellants were convicted of manslaughter.

On appeal, Stuart Smith LJ held that the jury should have been directed to consider the following issues:

> 'There must be some proportionality between the gravity of the threat and the action of the deceased in seeking to escape from it … [T]he deceased's conduct … [must] be something that a reasonable and responsible man in the assailant's shoes would have foreseen … [T]he nature of the threat is of importance in considering both the foreseeability of harm to the victim from the threat and the question whether the deceased’s conduct was proportionate to the threat, that is to say that it was within the ambit of reasonableness and not so daft as to make it his own voluntary act which amounted to a novus actus interveniens and consequently broke the chain of causation. It should of course be borne in mind that a victim may in the agony of the moment do the wrong thing …
>
> The jury should consider two questions: first, whether it was reasonably foreseeable that some harm, albeit not serious harm, was likely to result from the threat itself: and, secondly, whether the deceased's reaction in jumping from the moving car was within the range of responses which might be expected from a victim placed in the situation which he was. The jury should bear in mind any particular characteristic of the victim and the fact that in the agony of the moment he may act without thought and deliberation …
>
> In our judgment, the failure of the judge to give any direction on causation was a misdirection and the conviction on this count must be quashed.’

## Abstract

Where in a case of death following a threat of violence there is a real issue as to causation, the jury should be directed to consider whether the action of the deceased in seeking to escape the threat was proportional in its gravity.

The deceased was a hitch-hiker who was picked up by a car containing W, D and B. He subsequently jumped from the car and sustained fatal head injuries. There was no evidence that a knife and stick in the car were shown to or used to threaten him. W, D and B blamed each other when interviewed by the police. They were tried on charges of manslaughter and robbery, on the basis that there had been a joint enterprise to rob the deceased, who had met his death trying to escape. None of them gave evidence at trial. B was acquitted, whilst W and D were convicted of both charges.

Held, allowing W and D's appeals, that

(1) what evidence there was of joint enterprise to rob bore equally against all three defendants, and given their verdict, the jury must have used the statement of D against W, accordingly W's conviction for robbery must be quashed, as must that for manslaughter, which depended on it;

(2) where in a case of death following a threat of violence there was a real issue as to causation, the jury should have been directed to consider whether the action of the deceased was proportional to its gravity; as the judge had not so directed, D's conviction for manslaughter should be quashed; his conviction for robbery should also be quashed given that the case of joint enterprise had failed (_[DPP v Daley (Frederick) [1980] A.C. 237, [1978] 12 WLUK 14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AE00100E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=41c73e896d584fc5aaf9ffd0330cfcc1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
