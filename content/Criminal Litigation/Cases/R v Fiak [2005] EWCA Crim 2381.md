# R v Fiak [2005] EWCA Crim 2381

A case where F stuffed his blanket down the toilet in his prison cell and the repeatedly flushed the toilet. This flooded the cell. Although the floor was waterproof and the blanket was washable, this constituted damage as both were temporarily unusable.

## Summary

An arrest had not been rendered unlawful by the police officer's failure to use the word "arrest" until after a brief investigation into the defendant's story was completed. The detention, investigation and subsequent completion of the arrest were part of a single process that was not to be artificially compartmentalised. The flooding of a police cell by placing a blanket down the lavatory had caused damage to the blanket and the cell for the purposes of the [Criminal Damage Act 1971](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I07FF7A60E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b363072becae4276b3279bfceffbe39e&contextData=(sc.Default)).

## Abstract

The appellant (F) appealed against his convictions for assault of a police officer with intent to avoid or prevent his lawful apprehension or detention and for criminal damage to a blanket and police cell. F had been sitting in his car outside his house when he had been approached by police officers who suspected him of being in charge of the vehicle when he had consumed excess alcohol. F had said that he had had an argument with his wife and had left the house for a few minutes for some fresh air and had not been driving. F had been told not to return to his house and that he was being detained while one of the officers checked the accuracy of his story with his wife in order to determine whether an offence had been committed. F had ignored the instruction to remain outside the house and a struggle ensued in which one of the police officers claimed to have been injured by F. F had then been arrested and taken to the police station where he flooded his cell by placing his blanket down the lavatory and flushing it repeatedly.

F submitted that  
(1) until the word "arrest" had been uttered he had not been lawfully arrested and was at liberty to resist any unlawful attempt to restrain him;  
(2) there was no evidence that the blanket or the cell had been damaged because the water had been clean and both could be used again when dry.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) The police officer's conduct in deciding to detain F while investigating his story was part of a single process of arrest, not to be artificially compartmentalised, or fragmented into a series of individual processes. The police officer already had ample grounds to justify F's arrest and her conduct was not rendered unlawful because she did not formally use the word "arrest" until her brief investigation into F's story was completed. At that point the police officer had very good reason to complete the arrest. F had been aware of the reason for his detention and the express communication to F of the reasons for his arrest had taken place as soon as reasonably practicable.

(2) Although the effect of F's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used until it had been dried and the flooded cell was out of action until the water had been cleared. Both had sustained damage for the purposes of the [Criminal Damage Act 1971](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60608EE0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b363072becae4276b3279bfceffbe39e&contextData=(sc.Default)), _[Morphitis v Salmon (1990) 154 J.P. 365, [1989] 7 WLUK 68](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7979E710E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b363072becae4276b3279bfceffbe39e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Whiteley (Nicholas Alan) (1991) 93 Cr.
