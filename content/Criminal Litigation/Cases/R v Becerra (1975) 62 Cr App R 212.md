# R v Becerra (1975) 62 Cr App R 212

FACTS: Becerra had broken into a house with C and G, intending to steal. B gave a knife to C to use on anyone interrupting them if necessary. The tenant of the upstairs flat came down to investigate the noise. B said, ‘come on, let’s go’ and got out through a window.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that something ‘vastly different and vastly more effective’ was required for a sufficient communication of withdrawal. Roskill LJ stated, _obiter_, that a point of time might be reached when the only way he could effectively withdraw so as to free himself from joint responsibility for any act C thereafter did in furtherance of the common design, would be physically to intervene so as to stop C attacking the victim, by interposing his own body between them or somehow getting in between them.
