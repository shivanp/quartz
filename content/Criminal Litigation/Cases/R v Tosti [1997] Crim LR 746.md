# R v Tosti [1997] Crim LR 746

One of the farm owners was watching over the farm when he saw the appellants went to the door of the barn. They bent down and examined its padlock. The appellants saw the owner, and they ran off. The owner chased and caught one of the appellants, and he held him until the police arrived. He saw some oxyacetylene equipment hidden in a hedge near the barn. The other appellant was arrested at his home. The appellants were charged with and convicted of attempted burglary. In the appellants’ appeal, the issue arose as to whether the appellants’ acts amounted to acts done in the commission of attempted burglary. The Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, held that the facts, which were proved in evidence, were sufficient for the judge to leave to the jury the question of whether those acts were or were not merely preparatory, and whether the offence had been attempted. Accordingly, the jury found that there was attempted burglary. It followed that the appeals would be dismissed.
