# Woolmington [1935] AC 462

## Summary

In a criminal case, the prosecution had to prove the defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt; in the instant case, in which the defendant had been charged with the murder of his wife, the trial judge had erred by directing the jury that the defendant bore the burden of proving his assertion that his wife's death had been accidental.

## Abstract

The appellant (W) appealed against an order of the Court of Criminal Appeal refusing him leave to appeal against his conviction for the murder of his wife (X).

X had left W and gone to live with her mother. W took a gun to X's mother's house, where X was fatally shot. M maintained that he intended to show X the gun and tell her that he would commit suicide if she did not come back to live with him and that, while he was showing her the gun, it discharged accidentally, killing her. When summing up, the judge directed the jury that, if the Crown had established that X had died at W's hands, W had to show that there were circumstances to be found in the evidence given from the witness-box which alleviated the crime so that it was only manslaughter or which excused the homicide altogether by showing that it was a pure accident.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

Throughout the web of the English criminal law, one golden thread was always to be seen: it was the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt, subject to certain exceptions. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there was a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution would not have made out the case and the prisoner would be entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution had to prove the guilt of the prisoner was part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down could be entertained. When dealing with a murder case, the Crown had to prove, first, death as the result of a voluntary act of the accused and, second, malice of the accused. It could prove malice either expressly or by implication, for malice could be implied where death occurred as the result of a voluntary act of the accused which was intentional and unprovoked. When evidence of death and malice had been given (that was a question for the jury), the accused was entitled to show by evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the Crown that the act on his part which caused death was either unintentional or provoked. If the jury were either satisfied with his explanation or, on a review of all the evidence, left in reasonable doubt whether, even if his explanation was not accepted, the act was unintentional or provoked, he would be entitled to be acquitted. The judge's summing-up was not in accordance with the law of England. Further, it could not be said that, if the jury had been properly directed, they would have inevitably come to the same conclusion. W's conviction would therefore be quashed.
