# R v Smith (1959) 2 QB 35

FACTS: Smith stabbed the victim during a fight at their barracks and pierced his lung. Another soldier tried to carry him to the medical station but dropped him twice on the way. On his arrival it was not realised how seriously ill the victim was, and he received treatment that was not only inappropriate but positively harmful, and he died a couple of hours later.

HELD: Smith was convicted of murder, because it was held that his actions remained a substantial and operating cause. The medical negligence, while a cause, was not a sufficient cause to sever the chain of causation.

Lord Parker LCJ:

> 'It seems to the court that, if at the time of death the original wound is still an operating cause and a substantial cause, then the death can properly be said to be the result of the wound, albeit that some other cause of death is also operating. Only if it can be said the original wounding is merely the setting in which another cause operates can it be said that the death does not result from the wound. Putting it another way, only if the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history can it be said that death does not follow from the wound.'
