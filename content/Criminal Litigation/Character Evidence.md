# Character Evidence

```toc
```

When can previous convictions of Ds or witnesses be admitted in evidence at trial?

## History

### Pre-CJA 2003

D's previous convictions were not admissible except in very limited circumstances.

1. Where previous convictions amounted to “similar fact” evidence. These were convictions for “strikingly similar” offences.
2. Where D entered the witness box and either:
	1. Gave evidence to suggest he was of good character
	2. Attacked the character of a prosecution witness
	3. Gave evidence implicating a co-accused.

In (2), D loses their general shield of being in the witness box.

### CJA 2003 Changes

| Term          | Definition                                                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bad character | Evidence of, or a disposition towards, misconduct (s 98 CJA 2003) |
| Misconduct    | The commission of an offence or other reprehensible behaviour (s 112 CJA 2003).                                                                  |

If the alleged misconduct by D is connected to the offence with which he has been charged, this will not fall within the definition of bad character in s 98, and will therefore be admissible in evidence without needing to consider the test for admissibility of bad character evidence. This distinction applies to persons other than D too.

## 7 Gateways

> [!statute] s 101(1) CJA 2003 - D's bad character
> In criminal proceedings evidence of the defendant’s bad character is admissible if, but only if—
> - (a) all parties to the proceedings agree to the evidence being admissible,
> - (b) the evidence is adduced by the defendant himself or is given in answer to a question asked by him in cross-examination and intended to elicit it,
> - (c) it is important explanatory evidence,
> - (d) it is relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution,
> - (e) it has substantial probative value in relation to an important matter in issue between the defendant and a co-defendant,
> - (f) it is evidence to correct a false impression given by the defendant, or
> - (g) the defendant has made an attack on another person’s character.

## Gateway (d)

“Important matter” means a matter of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole (s 112(1) CJA 2003).

> [!statute] s 103(1) CJA 2003 - “Matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution”
> For the purposes of section 101(1)(d) the matters in issue between the defendant and the prosecution include—
> - (a) the question whether the defendant has a **propensity to commit offences** of the kind with which he is charged, except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence;
> - (b) the question whether the defendant has a **propensity to be untruthful**, except where it is not suggested that the defendant’s case is untruthful in any respect.

Only the prosecution may adduce evidence of D's bad character (s 103(6)).

### Propensity to Commit Offences of the Kind Charged

> [!statute] s 103(2)-(5)
> (2) Where subsection (1)(a) applies, a defendant’s propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he is charged may (without prejudice to any other way of doing so) be established by evidence that he has been convicted of—
> - (a) an offence of the **same description** as the one with which he is charged, or
> - (b) an offence of the **same category** as the one with which he is charged.
> 
> (3) Subsection (2) does not apply in the case of a particular defendant if the court is satisfied, by reason of the **length of time** since the conviction or for any other reason, that it would be **unjust** for it to apply in his case.
> 
> (4) For the purposes of subsection (2)—
> - (a) two offences are of the same description as each other if the statement of the offence in a written charge or indictment would, in each case, be in the same terms;
> - (b) two offences are of the same category as each other if they belong to the same category of offences prescribed for the purposes of this section by an order made by the Secretary of State.
> 
> (5) A category prescribed by an order under subsection (4)(b) must consist of offences of the same type.

#### Offences of the Same Description

Previous convictions do not need to be identical, just sufficient to support an offence charged on the same terms. Evidence of basic intent offences not resulting in GBH could not be used in a murder trial ([[Bullen v R [2008] EWCA Crim 4]]), since a propensity to violence is not in issue/ an important matter to the issue. The important matter is whether the specific intent needed for murder was present.

#### Offences of the Same Category

SoS has prescribed two categories of offences:

- Sexual offences category (sexual offences against children under 16)
- Theft category (including theft, robbery, burglary, etc.)

#### Other Offences

Even if not in the same description/ category, a conviction for the earlier offence may still be admissible if there are significant factual similarities between the offences.

#### Other Ways to Prove Propensity

The prosecution are free to prove a propensity to commit offences of the same kind without reference to previous convictions.

[[R v Hanson, Gilmore & Pickstone [2005] Crim LR 787]] sets guidelines for when CPS seeks to adduce evidence of D's previous convictions to demonstrate propensity to commit offences of the kind charged.

- CPS should answer each of the following affirmatively before allowing convictions in evidence:
	1. Does D's history of offending show a propensity to commit offences?
	2. If so, does that propensity make it more likely that D committed the current offence?
	3. If so, is it just to rely on convictions of the same description or category, minding the overriding principle that proceedings should be fair?
- Offences may go beyond offences of the same description or same category
- The fewer the number of previous convictions D has, the less likely that propensity will be established.
	- If there is only 1 previous conviction, unlikely to show propensity unless there is are “distinguishing circumstances” (e.g., arson, noncing).
- The manner in which the previous and current offences were carried out may be highly relevant to propensity and probative value.

### Propensity to Be Untruthful

In [[R v Hanson, Gilmore & Pickstone [2005] Crim LR 787]] the Court of Appeal held that a defendant’s previous convictions will not be admissible to show that the defendant has a propensity to be untruthful unless:

1. the **manner** in which the previous offence was committed demonstrates that the defendant has such a propensity (because he had made false representations), or
2. the defendant pleaded **not guilty** to the earlier offence, but was **convicted** following a trial at which his account was disbelieved.

#### Manner of Committing Previous Offence

Propensity to be untruthful $P_u$ $\subset$ Propensity to be dishonest. Previous convictions must involve D actively seeking to receive or mislead another person by making false representations.

- Perjury, fraud by false representation $\in P_u$
- Theft $\notin P_u$

#### Restriction

[[R v Campbell [2007] EWCA Crim 1472]]: D’s propensity to be untruthful will be an important matter in issue only where telling lies is an important element of the offence with which the defendant is charged (for example, perjury), and will not be an important matter in issue simply because the defendant has entered a not guilty plea to the offence charged. This decision is subject to academic criticism.

## Excluding and Weighing Character Evidence

### Excluding Evidence – S 101(3) CJA 2003

> [!statute] s 101(3) CJA 2003
> The court must not admit evidence under subsection (1)(d) or (g) if, on an application by the defendant to exclude it, it appears to the court that the admission of the evidence would have such an **adverse effect on the fairness** of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.

> [!note]
> This is the same test as under s 78 PACE 1984. But under s 78 the court has discretion as to whether to exclude on such grounds, whereas under s 101(3) the court must exclude evidence if the test is satisfied.

Powers likely to be used when:

1. The nature of D's previous convictions is such that a jury is likely to convict D on the basis of these convictions alone, where the evidence of previous convictions is more prejudicial or probative ([[R v Hackett [2019] EWCA Crim 983]]);
2. The CPS seeks to adduce previous convictions to support a case which is otherwise weak ([[R v Hanson, Gilmore & Pickstone [2005] Crim LR 787]]);
3. When D's previous convictions are spent
	- Certain convictions are “spent” after a prescribed period of time, meaning the convicted person is treated as never having been convicted of the offence.
	- Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.

| Sentence                              | Rehabilitation period (from conviction) |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Absolute discharge                   | None                                    |
| Conditional discharge                | None                                    |
| Fine                                 | 1 year                                  |
| Community Order                      | 1 year                                  |
| Custodial sentence $<6$ months       | 2 years                                 |
| $6$ months $<$ sentence $<30$ months | 4 years                                 |
| $30$ months $<$ sentence $<4$ years  | 7 years                                 |

### Excluding Evidence – S 78 PACE 1984

The court has power to exclude bad character evidence admitted through gateways (d) and (g), but not through the other gateways. But it also has a discretionary power under s 78 PACE 1984 to exclude evidence on which the prosecution rely if it would have such an **adverse effect on the fairness** of proceedings that it ought not to be admitted.

[[R v Highton & Others [2005] EWCA Crim 1985]]: judges should apply the provisions of s 78 when making rulings as to the use of evidence of bad character, and exclude evidence where it would be appropriate to do so under s 78.

### General Guidance

Set out in [[R v Hanson, Gilmore & Pickstone [2005] Crim LR 787]]:

1. Prosecution applications to adduce bad character evidence should not be made routinely, and should be carefully balanced.
2. Where evidence against D is otherwise weak, it may be unfair to admit evidence of D's previous convictions if this would prejudice minds
3. Each individual previous conviction needs to be examined separately.

Role of trial judge:

- Not to be unduly swayed by previous convictions
- Propensity to commit$\centernot\implies$D guilty
- To decide whether previous convictions do show a propensity
- Take into account what D says about previous convictions
- Propensity is only one relevant factor.

### Switching Gateways

Evidence of a defendant’s bad character which is adduced under one gateway **may then be used for any purpose** for which bad character evidence was relevant in the particular case ([[R v Highton & Others [2005] EWCA Crim 1985]]).

## Conduct

> [!question]
> You are representing Dave who is charged with an offence of possession of cocaine with intent to supply, contrary to s5(3) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Dave has pleaded not guilty. The CPS advise you that they plan to make an application to adduce evidence of Dave’s bad character. They have disclosed to you a list of  Dave's previous convictions. You  immediately notice that the record does not include a recent conviction for possession of cannabis with intent to supply that Dave has told you about in an earlier consultation. Dave pleaded guilty to this earlier offence.

If the CPS find out about the conviction for possession of cannabis with intent to supply, they are likely to argue that it should be admissible as evidence at Dave’s trial as it establishes a propensity to commit the same type of offence with which he is now charged. Note that you cannot tell the CPS about the conviction without your client’s consent, in accordance with your duty of confidentiality under the SRA Code of Conduct, paragraph 6.3 (although of course you must not mislead the court about it either, given your obligation in the SRA Code of Conduct, paragraph 1.4).

## Admitting Bad Character Evidence Procedure

- If the CPS wishes to adduce bad character **of D** at trial
	- Must serve notice to the court and the other parties (CrimPR r 21.4(1) & (2)).
	- **Notice** sent $\leq 20$ business days ([[Magistrates' Court]]) or $\leq 10$ business days ([[Crown Court]]) after D pleads not guilty (r 21.4(3)).
	- If **D** opposes this, must make an application to exclude bad character evidence $\leq 10$ business days after receiving notice from CPS.
- If D wishes to adduce bad character **of a witness** at trial
	- **Serve notice** to court and other parties (r 21.3(1) & (2))
	- Notice served as soon as reasonably practicable and $\leq 10$ business days after the CPS discloses to D details of the previous convictions of any of its witnesses (r 21.3(3)(a) & (b))
	- If CPS opposes, must send notice to the court and all other parties $\leq 10$ business days after receiving D's application (r 21.3(4)).  
- If the CPS wishes to adduce bad character **of a witness** at trial
	- Must serve notice to the court and the other parties (CrimPR r 21.4(1) & (2)) as soon as reasonably practicable (r 21.3(3)(a)).
	- If **D** opposes this, must send notice to court & other parties $\leq 10$ business days after receiving the application (r 21.3(4)).

In all cases, a prescribed form must be used. Must include a written record of previous convictions the party is seeking to adduce.
