# Bail

```toc
```

Usually there are several adjournments before a case is concluded.

## Remand Periods

> [!defn] Remand
> An adjournment where the court attempts to ensure D will attend the next hearing. May be remanded:
> 1. In custody
> 2. On bail with conditions
> 3. On unconditional bail. 

### Remand in Custody Prior to Conviction

- Basic rule: D may not be remanded in custody for **$> 8$ clear days** at a time.
- If there are successive remands, D must be brought before the court on every 4th remand, if D has consented and has legal representation.
- Court may remand D for $\leq 28$ days if:
	- Previously remanded in custody for the same offence
	- D is before the court, and
	- It can set a date on which it expects the next stage of proceedings to take place.

#### Custody Time Limits

- Overall maximum period of remand in custody in the magistrates' court is:
	- 70 days before trial for an either way offence
	- 56 days before trial for a summary only offence.
	- If case involves an either way offence and the allocation hearing takes place within 56 days, the custody time limit is reduced to 56 days.
- Prosecution may apply to have custody time limit extended.
	- Must show on the balance of probabilities that (s 22 Prosecution of Offences Act 1985):
		- There is good and sufficient cause
		- It has acted with due diligence and expedition.
	- Both D and prosecution can appeal to the Crown Court a decision on the application to extend custody time limit.
- Once the custody time limit has expired, D must be released on bail until his trial.

#### Custody

- D will be kept in a prison or remand centre.
- s 128(7) Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 allows remand to police custody for $\leq 3$ days if necessary to make enquiries in relation to offences.
- This is likely if D is arrested and charged for one offence, but the police suspect involvement in other offences.

### Remand After Conviction

D may be remanded in custody prior to sentence for successive periods **$\leq 3$ weeks**.

#### Remands After Case Sent to Crown Court

Remand in custody or bail until the case comes before the Crown Court.

## Right to Bail

s 4 Bail Act 1976, presumption of bail applies (subject to exceptions) to:

1. All Ds prior to conviction
2. Ds convicted if their case has been adjourned for the court to obtain pre-sentence reports
3. Ds appearing before court for a breach of community sentence.

Does not apply to:

1. Ds committed to **Crown Court for sentence**
2. Ds appealing against conviction or sentence.
3. Ds charged of serious offences (s 25 CJPOA 1994), including murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, rape, attempted rape, other sexual offences.
	1. If D is charged with murder and makes an application for bail, s 115 CJA 2009 states that only a Crown Court judge may grant bail, within 48 hours.
	2. s 114(2) CJA 2009: bail may not be granted unless the court believes there is no significant risk of D committing an offence likely to cause physical or mental injury to anther.

## Right to Bail: Exceptions

### No Real Prospect of Custody

Where:

- D is $\geq 18$ yo
- D has not been convicted of an offence
- It appears to the court that there is no real prospect of D being sentenced to a custodial sentence, CPS will seek a remand on bail (paras 2-7, Part 1, Sch 1, Bail Act 1976).

### Indictable-only and Either Way

Most common grounds upon CPS will object to bail being granted is (para 2(1)) where there are substantial grounds for believing D will:

- Fail to surrender to custody
- Commit an offence while on bail
- Interfere with a witness in the case

The court must take into account all relevant factors (para 9), including:

1. The nature and seriousness of the offence (and the probable sentence D will receive for it)
	- Relevant to prosecution argument that there are substantial grounds for believing D will fail to surrender to custody if granted bail.
	- D can argue that the offence is serious but D is pleading not guilty and anxious to clear his name at trial.
2. The character, antecedents, associations and community ties of D
	- Ds previous convictions
	- D's solicitor can argue that these were not recent, so there are no substantial grounds, or that D's circumstances have changed (e.g., no longer stealing to fuel drug addiction).
	- If D is subject to a suspended sentence, bail less likely.
	- If D is associated with a criminal gang/ has criminal connections, bail less likely, since D could use these to leave the area.
	- Might D attempt to interfere with a witness? Can appropriate conditions mitigate this risk?
	- Strength of community ties makes it less likely D will run away.
3. D's record in respect of previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings
	- Previous conviction for absconding?
	- Or argue that D never broke bail during remands on bail for previous offences.
4. Strength of evidence against D.
	- Argue the evidence is poor/ D has an innocent explanation.

### Summary Only Imprisonable Offences

Bail for these offences may be refused only on grounds of (s 52 & Sch 12 CIJA 2008):

1. Failure to surrender (if D previously failed to surrender)
2. Commission of further offences (if instant offence was committed on bail)
3. Fear of commission of offences likely to cause physical/ mental injury
4. D's own protection (or welfare if a youth)
5. D serving custody
6. Fear of interference of witnesses/ obstruction of witnesses, and
7. Lack of sufficient information.

### Non-imprisonable Offences

Under Sch 1, Pt II to the Bail Act 1976, the court may refuse bail to a defendant charged with a non-imprisonable offence only if:

1. D previously failed to answer bail and court believes D would do this again
2. D needs to be kept in custody for own welfare
3. D currently serving custodial sentence
4. D granted bail at an earlier hearing in the same proceedings, but broke conditions/ failed to answer, and court believes D would do it again/ commit offence/ interfere with witnesses/ obstruct the court of justice.

## Conditional Bail

A court has the power to grant bail subject to conditions necessary to:

- Prevent D absconding
- Prevent D committing a further offence
- Prevent D from interfering with witnesses/ obstructing the course of justice
- Ensure D makes himself available to obtain medical/ other reports
- Ensure D keeps appointments with solicitor
- Ensure D's own protection

### Sureties

> [!defn] Surety
> A person who enters a "recognisance" of money and is under an obligation to use every reasonable effort to ensure D attends court. 

Can be used to ensure D answers bail. If D fails to answer bail, the court must declare an immediate and automatic forfeiture of the recognisance. A court hearing will then determine whether some or all of the surety should be paid.

The surety must give evidence of their financial resources, character, previous convictions and relationship.

> [!conduct]
> A solicitor should never stand surety for D. 

### Security

D required to deposit money/ goods with the court, which will be forfeited if bail is broken. Usually used for rich Ds.

### Reporting to Police Station

Court may order D to regularly report to the local police station (e.g., once a day at a specific time).

### Residence

Court requires D to reside at a specified address. Police will check the condition by visiting the address late at night and early in the morning.

The court may impose a condition of residence in a bail hostel run by the Probation Service, if D does not have a permanent address.

D may be electronically monitored (“tagged”).

### Curfew

Police may visit the residence during curfew answers to check D is there. Usually coupled with tagging.

### Non-communication with Prosecution Witnesses

Used if the court is concerned D may try to intimidate a witness.

### Restriction on Entering Specific Areas

Used to prevent interference with prosecution witnesses/ prevent D committing further offences while on bail.

### Attending Appointments

Require D to keep in regular contact with solicitor and attend meetings. Or attend such meetings and appointments as are necessary for the preparation for a pre-sentence report/ medical report.

### Surrender of Passport

Only likely where D has substantial financial assets/ criminal contacts outside the UK.

## Bail Application Procedure

![[contested-bail-application.png]]

1. CPS provides D's solicitor and court with all material information (CrimPR, r 14.5(2)).
2. CPS states objection to bail and applies for D to be remanded in custody, listing grounds and applying factors.
3. D's solicitor makes an application for bail. Replies to grounds and applies factors. Ask for unconditional bail, but suggest appropriate condition in the alternative.
4. Magistrates hear evidence from other people (e.g., D's prospective employer)
5. Magistrate decides whether to remand D in custody or on bail.

A court may later vary conditions on the application of the CPS/ D's solicitor. If magistrates grant unconditional bail, may subsequently impose conditions on such bail considered appropriate.

## Further Applications for Bail

If bail refused, magistrates are obliged to consider the question of bail at any subsequent hearing if D is still in custody and the presumption in favour of bail still applies.

- At the first hearing after the hearing at which the court refused to grant bail, Ds solicitor may make a full application for bail.
- At any subsequent hearing, the court need not hear arguments of fact or law it has heard previously (Bail Act 1976, Sch 1, Pt IIA).
- Magistrates will ignore a hearing at which bail was refused on the grounds of insufficient information.
- if D remanded in custody after hearing a fully argued bail application, it will issue a “full argument” certificate.

## Appealing Bail Decisions

### Defendant (r 14.2 CrimPR)

D may appeal to Crown Court provided the magistrates have issued the “full argument certificate”. Best to do this after the second appeal to the [[Magistrates' Court]].

To appeal:

- D's solicitors send the prescribed form to the Crown Court and [[Magistrates' Court]]
- Serve this to CPS $\geq 2$ business days before the hearing.

Appeal heard before a Crown Court judge in chambers Judge will need:

1. Notice of application form
2. Full argument certificate
3. Record of D's previous convictions.

Send these prior to the appeal being heard. Judge will hear representations from the CPS and D's solicitor.
