# Initial Hearing (Magistrates' Ct)

```toc
```

## Introduction

All Ds aged $\geq 18$ charged with a criminal offence will make their first appearance before the magistrates' court.

- If D is charged with an indictable-only offence, the magistrates will immediately send the case to the Crown Court for trial (s 51 CDA 1998).
- Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (when in force) changes provisions concerning business crimes:
	- Enables legally represented Ds to engage with pre-trial criminal court proceedings (e.g., indicating plea on an online platform, rather than at a magistrates' court).
	- More flexibility in allocating criminal cases between magistrates' and Crown Court.
	- Enables [[Crown Court]] to return some cases to [[Magistrates' Court]].
	- Enables electronic service of documents in criminal cases where appropriate.
- CJSSS - "Criminal Justice: Simple, Speedy, Summary" rolled out in 2007.
	- Aims to speed up proceedings in [[Magistrates' Court]]
	- Presumption that a plea will be entered at the first hearing
	- For guilty pleas, sentencing usually on the same day
	- Not guilty plea: trial date fixed for 6-8 weeks
	- CPS provides sufficient information to ensure the first hearing is effective.

## First Hearing

If D was charged by the police, he will:

1. Come to court in custody if refused bail, or
	- Kept in police custody until brought before a [[Magistrates' Court]].
	- Normally within a day of being charged.
2. Attend court to “answer” bail if granted bail.

If the police refused bail, it is likely that the CPS will oppose bail and a full bail hearing will be necessary.

## Procedure

What happens at the first hearing depends on:

1. The classification of the offence
2. The plea entered by D
3. The level of detail provided by the CPS
4. Whether public/ private funding is secured.

CPS should make sufficient disclosure to enable D to enter a plea, and D should be prepared to do so. The case may be adjourned if there are still issues outstanding, in which case the magistrates will decide whether D should be granted bail until the next hearing (in ~2 weeks).

### Summary Offences

- D pleads guilty
	- Representative from CPS tells the magistrates the facts of the case
	- D's solicitor gives a plea in mitigation on D's behalf
	- Magistrates will sentence D straight away or adjourn the case if
		- They want to obtain any reports (eg. pre-sentence report from the Probation Service), or
		- D disputes the specific factual allegations made by the CPS. A “Newton hearing” is necessary to determine the factual basis upon which D will be sentenced.
- D pleads not guilty
	- Court will fix a date for D's trial and issue case management directions.

### Either Way Offences

- D pleads guilty
	- Magistrates determine whether to sentence D or commit D to the Crown Court (if their sentencing powers are insufficient).
	- Case may need to be adjourned
- D pleads not guilty
	- "Plea before venue and allocation procedure" – determine whether D is to be tried in [[Magistrates' Court]] or [[Crown Court]].

### Indictable-only Offences

Adult D sent straight to the Crown Court, following a preliminary hearing at the [[Magistrates' Court]] (s 51(1) CDA 1998).

## Role of Defence Solicitor

Role involves:

- Obtaining funding from the LAA to pay for the work (unless client paying solicitor privately)
- Obtain details of prosecution case from CPS
- Take a statement from the client
- Advise client on strength of prosecution evidence and the plea which should be entered
- For either-way offence, advise on advantages and disadvantages of each court.
- Making an application for bail if necessary.

## Funding Case

Defence solicitors will make applications on behalf of their clients for clients' cases to receive public funding from the LAA. Art 6(3) ECHR: defendants who do not have sufficient means to pay for legal assistance should receive this free of charge.

To obtain public funding for clients, a firm of solicitors must have a 'general criminal contract' with the LAA. These firms are subject to an annual audit to ensure files are run properly.

### Work Done Before Client Charged

- Solicitors usually first provide advice at the police station.
	- Everyone at the police station is entitled to free legal advice, regardless of means.
	- Work done by a solicitor at the police station will be claimed as a fixed fee under Police Station Advice and Assistance Scheme.
	- Non-solicitors can do this work if accredited or probationary police station representatives.
	- Some solicitors are members of duty solicitors schemes.
- Outside police station
	- If the client is of limited means, solicitor will be able to fund any preliminary work they carry out on the client's behalf under the Advice and Assistance Scheme
	- Does not cover work done for a client after the client is charged.
	- The client must apply for a representation order.

#### Advocacy Assistance

A solicitor may provide Advocacy Assistance for a client of limited means involved in criminal investigations:

1. when the client is the subject of an application for a warrant for further detention, or for an extension of such a warrant; or
2. when the client is the subject of an application to extend detention in military custody; or
3. where there is an application to vary police bail conditions (including ‘street bail’ conditions) imposed by the police under s 30BC or 47(1E) of PACE 1984, as amended by the CJA 2003.

The solicitor can claim under fixed rates for such work.

### Work Done After Client Charged

#### Duty Solicitor Scheme

Operates in the [[Magistrates' Court]], in a similar way to at the police station. Solicitors will have their names on a rota. Costs of attending court will be claimed from the LAA under Advocacy Assistance (Court Duty Solicitor) Scheme.

### Representation Order

> [!test]
> To apply for criminal legal aid in the magistrates' court, D must satsify:
> 1. Interests of justice test - D must show that it is in the interests of justice that they receive public funding for legal representation. 
> 2. Means test - D must demonstrate inability to pay for the costs of legal representation. 

D must submit Form CRM14 – Application for Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings. Unless means test is automatically satisfied, D must submit a financial statement (Form CRM15) and supporting documentation (unless unable to provide due to being in custody, in which case this should be stated).

#### Interests of Justice Test

Ensures compliance with Article 6(3)(a) of the ECHR, which provides that a defendant who does not have sufficient means to pay for legal assistance should receive this free ‘when the interests of justice’ so require.

> [!defn] Widgery criteria
> Factors taken into account in deciding whether D can satisfy the interests of justice test. Set out in Sch 3 para 5(2) Access to Justice Act 1999 (N.B. this has been repealed - presumably still relevant?). 

These are whether:

1. It’s likely I’ll lose my liberty
	- If D is charged with a serious offence likely to result in a prison sentence if convicted
	- Check sentencing guidelines
	- Check any previous convictions against D
	- Check aggravating factors
	- For an indictable-only offence, this should be straightforward to argue.
	- Relevant also if the court is likely to refuse bail (so check previous bail record etc.)
2. I’ve been given a sentence that’s suspended or non-custodial: if I break this, the court may be able to deal with me for the original offence
	- Relevant if D is subject to a suspended prison sentence in respect of a previous offence and commits a further offence.
	- Statutory presumption that sentence will be activated (SC 2020, Sch 16).
	- D subject to conditional discharge
	- D subject to generic community order.
3. It’s likely that I’ll lose my livelihood
	- Relevant if D in employment and a conviction is likely to lead to the loss of that employment.
	- Applicable to positions of trust, certain regulated professions, working with children etc.
	- If a guilty plea is intended, need to demonstrate how legal representation may help avoid losing livelihood.
4. It’s likely that I’ll suffer serious damage to my reputation
	- More than the direct effect of the penalty
	- Ds with no previous convictions or convictions for very minor offences.
	- D has position of standing or respect in the community.
5. A substantial question of law may be involved
	- Challenging the admissibility of evidence
	- Disputing identification evidence
	- Adverse inferences from refusal to answer questions (ss 34, 36 37 CJPOA 1994)
	- Admitting hearsay evidence (s 114 CJA 2003)
	- Confession made to be excluded (ss 76 or 78 PACE 1984)
	- Prosecution want to adduce evidence at trial evidence of Ds previous convictions under s 101 CJA 2003.
6. I may not be able to understand the court proceedings or present my own case
	- Mental or physical disability
	- Poor knowledge of English
	- Age
	- Vulnerability
7. I may need witnesses to be traced or interviewed on my behalf
	- D wishes to call a witness in support of their case.
	- Must explain why legal representation is needed for this.
8. The proceedings may involve expert cross-examination of a prosecution witness
	- E.g., if police officers giving evidence for the prosecution need to be examined.
9. It’s in the interests of another person that I’m represented
	- If a person is accused of a sexual or violent offence, inappropriate for them to cross-examine the complainant in such a case.
	- Inappropriate to examine a child witness in person.
	- “Someone else” means witness or prosecution, not D's family/ the court.
10. Any other reasons
	- If D is pleading not guilty, common practice to state this here.

#### Means Test

The following will receive criminal legal aid automatically without needing to satisfy the means test:

1. applicants who receive income support, income-based jobseeker’s allowance, guaranteed State pension credit, income-related employment and support allowance or universal credit; and
2. applicants who are under the age of 18.

Applicants not falling into the above categories must submit Form CRM15 along with evidence to substantiate their financial details (tax returns, payslips, mortgage statements/ tenancy agreements).

##### Initial Means Test

The court will apply an initial means test. Considers an applicant's income and expenses, but not the applicant's capital. Gross income is taken, and adjusted income calculated by dividing by a weighted multiplier (depending on whether the applicant has a partner or children).

| Adjusted income $P$           | Qualify for legal aid?   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| $P < £12,475$                 | Yes                      |
| $£12,475 \leq P \leq £22,325$ | Full means test required |
| $P > £22,325$                 | No                         |

##### Full Means Test

Applicant's disposable income calculated.

| Gross income                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- |
| *Less*                                          |
| Tax and national insurance                      |
| Annual housing costs                            |
| Annual childcare costs                          |
| Annual maintenance to former partners/ children |
| Adjusted annual living allowance                |
| =                                               |
| Disposable income                               |

> [!important]
> To qualify for criminal legal aid, the applicant’s annual disposable income must not exceed **£3,398**.

If the applicant fails the means test but cannot fund his own defence, complete an application for review on the grounds of hardship (Form CRM16).

#### Scope

If a defendant satisfies both the interests of justice test and the means test, the magistrates’ court will grant a criminal defence representation order and the order will be sent to his solicitor.

This will cover all the work done by the solicitor in connection with the proceedings in the [[Magistrates' Court]], and may be extended to cover an appeal to the Crown Court.

Either way offences: where D has failed the magistrates 'court means test and the case is committed to the Crown Court, funding will not start until the day after the sending hearing and will only cover work done in the Crown Court, if D passes the means eligibility test in the Crown Court.

If D's application for legal aid is refused under the "interests of justice test" can appeal to the [[Magistrates' Court]] by adding extra details to CRM14 and resubmitting to the court.

At the conclusion of the case, the defence solicitor will claim back any costs incurred under the representation order from the LAA.

## Statement From Client

Take a full and detailed statement from the client asap. This will never be disclosed to the court/ prosecution. Get the statement checked and signed by the client.

Include:

- Personal details
- Details of charge
- Health problems
- Family circumstances
- Education and employment history
- Previous convictions
- What the client says about the current offence
- Relevant factors to mitigation
- Client's comments on prosecution evidence.

## Obtaining Details of Prosecution Case

Defence solicitor must see all prosecution evidence as soon as possible after D has been charged. What the CPS must disclose depends on what type of offence D has been charged with.

### Summary and Either Way Offences

D entitled to receive initial details of the prosecution case (IDPC) (CrimPR r 8.2).

D will contact the CPS in advance of the first hearing with a Unique Reference Number. CPS emails solicitor the IDPC via Criminal Justice Secure Mail account. For clients seen in court for the first time, the solicitor phones a centralised CPS number and papers will be emailed over.

> [!statute] r 8.4 CrimPR
> (1) This rule applies where—
> - (a) the prosecutor wants to introduce information contained in a document listed in rule 8.3; and
> - (b) the prosecutor has not—
> 	- (i) served that document on the defendant, or
> 	- (ii) made that information available to the defendant.
> 
> (2) The court must not allow the prosecutor to introduce that information unless the court first allows the defendant sufficient time to consider it. 

#### IDPC

Will include:

- If D was in police custody charged immediately before the first hearing:
	- A summary of the circumstances of the offence
	- D's criminal record
- All other circumstances
	- Summary of circumstances of offence
	- Account given by D in interview
	- Written witness statement or exhibit that the prosecutor has available and considers material to plea/ trial/ sentence.
	- Any available statement of the effect of the offence on a victim, their family and others.
- Where D has been released on bail after being charged, and the prosecutor does not anticipate a guilty plea at the first hearing (Crim PD 3A.12)
	- Statements and exhibits or importance, including any relevant CCTV and Streamlined Forensic Report
	- Indication of medical/ expert evidence the prosecution is likely to adduce
	- Information of special measures, bad character or hearsay.

## Advising on Plea

Discuss with the client:

1. The client's response to the prosecution case.
2. The strength of the prosecution case
3. Whether it is necessary to obtain further evidence in support of D's case
4. If D has been charged with an either way offence and pleads not guilty, whether to elect [[Magistrates' Court]] or [[Crown Court]] trial.

It is the client's decision what plea to make.

### Conduct

Suppose the client tells the solicitor that he is guilty of the offence.

- Client pleads guilty
	- They receive credit from the court for entering an early guilty plea
	- Solicitor able to give a plea in mitigation on the client's behalf.
- Client pleads not guilty
	- Solicitor can still represent at trial
	- Solicitor can cross-examine prosecution witnesses and put the prosecution to proof on their case.
	- A solicitor can make a submission of no case to answer at the end of the prosecution case and ask the magistrates to dismiss the case.
	- But if submission of no case to answer unsuccessful and D insisted on giving a false statement at the witness box, D's solicitor would have to withdraw (para 1.4 SRA Code – duty not to mislead the court). Withdraw citing “professional reasons”.

## Plea Before Venue

When D appears before the magistrates:

1. Charge read out to D by the court clerk/ legal advisor, who will check that D's solicitor has received advance disclosure of the prosecution case.
2. Clerk tells D he may indicate (no obligation) to the court how he would like to plead if the matter proceeds to trial.
3. Clerk asks D to give plea.

### Guilty Plea

- If D indicates a guilty plea, treated as having been tried summarily and convicted.
- CPS representative will outline the facts of the case to the magistrates and tell them about any previous convictions.
- D's solicitor will give a plea in mitigation on D's behalf.
- Magistrates decide whether they have sufficient sentencing powers
	- 6 months imprisonment for one either way offence
	- 12 months for two or more either way offences.
	- Decide this with reference to seriousness of offence, Magistrates' Court Sentencing Guidelines, and considering aggravating or mitigating factors.

#### Magistrates to Sentence

- Magistrates sentence D or adjourn the case for a pre-sentence report (or if a Newton hearing is necessary).
- Before Plea Protocol for a Pre-Sentence Report
	- Applies where adult D intends to plead guilty and likely that case will be sentenced in [[Magistrates' Court]].
	- D's solicitor can ask the Probation Service to prepare a pre-sentence report before the first hearing.
	- D must agree to cooperate with the Probation Service to prepare a report.
	- The court will decide whether to consider the report.
	- Solicitor must be satisfied that
		- Offence is serious enough for a community order
		- Pre-sentence report likely to be necessary.

#### Crown Court to Sentence

> [!statute] s 14 Sentencing Act 2020 - Committal for sentence on summary trial of offence triable either way
> 
> (1) This section applies where—
> - (a) on the summary trial of an offence triable either way a person aged 18 or over is convicted of the offence, and
> - (b) the court is of the opinion that—
> 	- (i) the offence, or
> 	- (ii) the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it,
> 
> was so serious that the Crown Court should have the power to deal with the offender in any way it could deal with the offender if the offender had been convicted on indictment.
> 
> (2) The court **may commit the offender** in custody or on bail **to the Crown Court for sentence** in accordance with section 21(2).

If D pleads guilty at the plea before venue hearing and is committed to Crown Court for sentence, the magistrates will not generally alter the position as regards bail or custody.

### Not Guilty Plea

**If** the defendant indicates a not guilty plea in the following circumstances, the court shall  
send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial (CDA 1998, s 50A(3)(b)):

1. the defendant is sent to the Crown Court for trial for a related offence;
2. the defendant is charged jointly with another adult defendant who is sent to the Crown Court for trial for a related offence;
3. the defendant is charged jointly, or charged with a related either way offence, with a youth defendant who is sent to the Crown Court for trial.

**Else**: court must make a decision as to allocation (Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, s 19(1)).

## Allocation

![[allocation-sending.png]]

Allocation guidelines direct that either way offences should be tried summarily unless it is likely that the court's sentencing powers will be insufficient.

### Procedure

Set out in ss 19-20 Magistrates' Courts Act 1980:

1. Prosecution informs court of facts and D's previous convictions, if any (s 19(2)(a)).
2. Magistrates consider:
	1. Representations about whether summary trial/ trial on indictment suitable (s 19(2)(b))
	2. Whether the sentence they have the power to impose would be adequate (s 19(3)(a)) (considering maximum aggregate sentence for related offences (s 19(4)).
	3. Allocation guideline issued by Sentencing Council.
		1. Either way offences should be tried summarily unless it is likely that the court’s sentencing powers will be insufficient.
		2. The court should assess the likely sentence in the light of the facts alleged by the prosecution case, taking into account all aspects of the case, including those advanced by the defence. The magistrates would do this by considering the Magistrates’ Court Sentencing Guidelines for the relevant offences.
3. If trial by indictment more suitable, D sent to [[Crown Court]] (Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s 21)
4. If court decides case more suitable for summary trial, explain to D:
	1. D can consent to be tried summary or choose trial by indictment
	2. If he consents to be tried summarily and is convicted, may be committed to Crown Court for sentencing.
5. D may request an indication of whether a custodial or non-custodial sentence would be more likely if tried summarily and pleaded guilty (ss 20(3)-(7)).
	1. The court has discretion over whether to give such an indication (s 20(4))
	2. s 20A(1): if D pleads guilty, no court may impose a custodial sentence unless such a sentence was indicated in the indication of sentence in s 20 (or further exceptions about being a dangerous offender/ committed to [[Crown Court]] for related offences).
	3. s 20A(3): subject to subsection (1), an indication of sentence is not binding on the court and no sentence may be challenged/ appealed on the ground that it is not consistent with the indication of sentence.
	4. So if D does not change his plea to guilty, the indication of sentence is not binding on any court.
6. D asked whether he consents to summary judgment or wishes to be trialled on indictment (s 20(8) & (9))
7. s 25: prosecution are permitted to make an application before summary trial for an either way offence allocated at summary trial to be sent to the Crown Court for trial.

> [!question] Suppose D pleads guilty to either way offence $EWO_G$ and not guilty to $EWO_{NG}$.
> Magistrates proceed with the allocation hearing in respect of $EWO_{NG}$. 
> - If magistrates accept jurisdiction, they will either sentence D immediately for $EWO_G$, or adjourn sentence until the end of $EWO_{NG}$ trial. 
> - If magistrates decline jurisdiction, send $EWO_{NG}$ to Crown Court for trial and decide whether to sentence D for$EWO_G$/ send to Crown Court. 

## Sending Straight to Crown Court

Either way offences can sometimes be sent straight to the Crown Court without a plea before venue and allocation, under s 50A CDA 1998. Circumstances:

1. Notice given by DPP in serious or complex fraud cases.
2. Notice has been served in cases involving children
3. Where there is an either way offence related to an indictable-only offence/ offence covered by the above, for which the same or another D is sent to the [[Crown Court]].

## Advising Client on Trial Venue

### [[Crown Court]] Advantages

1. Greater chance of acquittal
	- Statistically, juries are more sympathetic to Ds
	- If police officers often give evidence before the same magistrates' court, this may prejudice the magistrates.
	- If D has several previous convictions in front of the same [[Magistrates' Court]], may also prejudice.
2. Better procedure for challenging admissibility of prosecution evidence
	- Crown Court: where the admissibility of evidence is disputed, jury asked to leave the courtroom and the judge conducts a mini-trial to decide whether to admit the evidence.
	- [[Magistrates' Court]]: magistrates are responsible for determining matters of law and fact, so have to “set aside” their knowledge of a particular piece of evidence if admissible.
	- N.B. many magistrates' courts attempt to determine issues of admissibility at pre-trial hearings before a different bench of magistrates from the bench which hears the trial.
3. More time to prepare case for trial

### [[Magistrates' Court]] Advantages

1. Limited sentencing powers
	- 6 months' maximum sentence, or 12 months for 2 or more either-way offences.
	- But magistrates retain the power to commit D to the [[Crown Court]] if facts emerge making the offence more serious than it appeared at the allocation hearing.
2. Speed and stress
	- Generally trial takes place within weeks, not months.
	- Less formal environment: no wigs and gowns, as at the Crown Court.
3. Prosecution costs
	- D likely to be ordered to contribute towards the costs incurred by the CPS in bringing the case against him.
	- Costs likely to be higher in the Crown Court.
4. Defence costs
	- If granted legal aid in the magistrates' court, D not required to contribute towards defence costs.
	- In the Crown Court after 27/01/14, all legal aid applications subject to a financial eligibility test (household disposable income $<£37,500$)
	- Pre-2012, D could claim back the fees of their legal representation if acquitted. Now defence costs can be reimbursed, but only at legal aid rates, so long as D submitted an application for legal aid but was rejected due to financial ineligibility.
5. No obligation to serve defence statement.
	- D pleading not guilty in the Crown Court is obliged to serve on the court and prosecution a defence statement (ss 5,6,6A Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996).
	- This puts the prosecution on notice of the defence: lose the element of surprise.
