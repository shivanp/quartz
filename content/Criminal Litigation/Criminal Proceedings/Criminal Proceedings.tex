\section{Initial Hearing (Magistrates'
Ct)}\label{initial-hearing-magistrates-ct}}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

All Ds aged \(\geq 18\) charged with a criminal offence will make their
first appearance before the magistrates' court.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If D is charged with an indictable-only offence, the magistrates will
  immediately send the case to the Crown Court for trial (s 51 CDA
  1998).
\item
  Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (when in force) changes provisions
  concerning business crimes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Enables legally represented Ds to engage with pre-trial criminal
    court proceedings (e.g., indicating plea on an online platform,
    rather than at a magistrates' court).
  \item
    More flexibility in allocating criminal cases between magistrates'
    and Crown Court.
  \item
    Enables \href{no\%20financial\%20limit.}{{[}Crown Court{]}} to
    return some cases to
    \href{maximum\%20compensation\%20of\%20£5,000\%20per\%20offence}{{[}Magistrates'
    Court{]}}.
  \item
    Enables electronic service of documents in criminal cases where
    appropriate.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  CJSSS - ``Criminal Justice: Simple, Speedy, Summary'' rolled out in
  2007.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Aims to speed up proceedings in
    \href{maximum\%20compensation\%20of\%20£5,000\%20per\%20offence}{{[}Magistrates'
    Court{]}}
  \item
    Presumption that a plea will be entered at the first hearing
  \item
    For guilty pleas, sentencing usually on the same day
  \item
    Not guilty plea: trial date fixed for 6-8 weeks
  \item
    CPS provides sufficient information to ensure the first hearing is
    effective.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{first-hearing}{%
\subsection{First Hearing}\label{first-hearing}}

If D was charged by the police, he will:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Come to court in custody if refused bail, or

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Kept in police custody until brought before a
    \href{maximum\%20compensation\%20of\%20£5,000\%20per\%20offence}{{[}Magistrates'
    Court{]}}.
  \item
    Normally within a day of being charged.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Attend court to ``answer'' bail if granted bail.
\end{enumerate}

If the police refused bail, it is likely that the CPS will oppose bail
and a full bail hearing will be necessary.

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

What happens at the first hearing depends on:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The classification of the offence
\item
  The plea entered by D
\item
  The level of detail provided by the CPS
\item
  Whether public/ private funding is secured.
\end{enumerate}

CPS should make sufficient disclosure to enable D to enter a plea, and D
should be prepared to do so. The case may be adjourned if there are
still issues outstanding, in which case the magistrates will decide
whether D should be granted bail until the next hearing (in
\textasciitilde2 weeks).

\hypertarget{summary-offences}{%
\subsubsection{Summary Offences}\label{summary-offences}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  D pleads guilty

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Representative from CPS tells the magistrates the facts of the case
  \item
    D's solicitor gives a plea in mitigation on D's behalf
  \item
    Magistrates will sentence D straight away or adjourn the case if

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      They want to obtain any reports (eg. pre-sentence report from the
      Probation Service), or
    \item
      D disputes the specific factual allegations made by the CPS. A
      ``Newton hearing'' is necessary to determine the factual basis
      upon which D will be sentenced.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  D pleads not guilty

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Court will fix a date for D's trial and issue case management
    directions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{either-way-offences}{%
\subsubsection{Either Way Offences}\label{either-way-offences}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  D pleads guilty

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Magistrates determine whether to sentence D or commit D to the Crown
    Court (if their sentencing powers are insufficient).
  \item
    Case may need to be adjourned
  \end{itemize}
\item
  D pleads not guilty

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``Plea before venue and allocation procedure'' -- determine whether
    D is to be tried in
    \href{maximum\%20compensation\%20of\%20£5,000\%20per\%20offence}{{[}Magistrates'
    Court{]}} or \href{no\%20financial\%20limit.}{{[}Crown Court{]}}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{indictable-only-offences}{%
\subsubsection{Indictable-only
Offences}\label{indictable-only-offences}}

Adult D sent straight to the Crown Court, following a preliminary
hearing at the
\href{maximum\%20compensation\%20of\%20£5,000\%20per\%20offence}{{[}Magistrates'
Court{]}} (s 51(1) CDA 1998).

\hypertarget{role-of-defence-solicitor}{%
\subsection{Role of Defence Solicitor}\label{role-of-defence-solicitor}}

Role involves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Obtaining funding from the LAA to pay for the work (unless client
  paying solicitor privately)
\item
  Obtain details of prosecution case from CPS
\item
  Take a statement from the client
\item
  Advise client on strength of prosecution evidence and the plea which
  should be entered
\item
  For either-way offence, advise on advantages and disadvantages of each
  court.
\item
  Making an application for bail if necessary.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{funding-case}{%
\subsection{Funding Case}\label{funding-case}}

Defence solicitors will make applications on behalf of their clients for
clients' cases to receive public funding from the LAA. Art 6(3) ECHR:
defendants who do not have sufficient means to pay for legal assistance
should receive this free of charge.

To obtain public funding for clients, a firm of solicitors must have a
`general criminal contract' with the LAA. These firms are subject to an
annual audit to ensure files are run properly.

\hypertarget{work-done-before-client-charged}{%
\subsubsection{Work Done Before Client
Charged}\label{work-done-before-client-charged}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Solicitors usually first provide advice at the police station.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Everyone at the police station is entitled to free legal advice,
    regardless of means.
  \item
    Work done by a solicitor at the police station will be claimed as a
    fixed fee under Police Station Advice and Assistance Scheme.
  \item
    Non-solicitors can do this work if accredited or probationary police
    station representatives.

test and the case is committed to the Crown Court, funding will not
start until the day after the sending hearing and will only cover work
done in the Crown Court, if D passes the means eligibility test in the
Crown Court.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    6 months' maximum sentence, or 12 months for 2 or more either-way
    offences.
  \item
    But magistrates retain the power to commit D to the

    making the offence more serious than it appeared at the allocation
    hearing.

  \item
    Generally trial takes place within weeks, not months.

  Prosecution costs

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    D likely to be ordered to contribute towards the costs incurred by

    subject to a financial eligibility test (household disposable income
    \(<£37,500\))
  \item
    Pre-2012, D could claim back the fees of their legal representation
    if acquitted. Now defence costs can be reimbursed, but only at legal
    aid rates, so long as D submitted an application for legal aid but
    was rejected due to financial ineligibility.

\item
  No obligation to serve defence statement.

  \begin{itemize}

    D pleading not guilty in the Crown Court is obliged to serve on the
    court and prosecution a defence statement (ss 5,6,6A Criminal
    Procedure and Investigations Act 1996).

  D has not been convicted of an offence
\item
  It appears to the court that there is no real prospect of D being

\tightlist
\item
  Fail to surrender to custody
\item
  Commit an offence while on bail

    no longer stealing to fuel drug addiction).
  \item
    If D is subject to a suspended sentence, bail less likely.
  \item
    If D is associated with a criminal gang/ has criminal connections,
    bail less likely, since D could use these to leave the area.
  \item
    Might D attempt to interfere with a witness? Can appropriate
    conditions mitigate this risk?
  \item
    Strength of community ties makes it less likely D will run away.
  \end{itemize}

  D's record in respect of previous grants of bail in criminal
  proceedings

  \begin{itemize}

  so.

sentencing guideline, effective from 01/10/19.

\hypertarget{general-guideline}{%
\subsubsection{General Guideline}\label{general-guideline}}

See the steps below

\hypertarget{provisional-sentence}{%
\paragraph{1: Provisional Sentence}\label{provisional-sentence}}

Court should take into account:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statutory maximum/ minimum sentence
\item
  Sentencing judgments of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)
\item
  Definitive sentencing guidelines for analogous offences.
\end{itemize}

Seriousness assessed considering the culpability of the offender and the
harm caused.

Consider the 5 purposes of sentencing.

\hypertarget{aggravating-and-mitigating-factors}{%
\paragraph{2: Aggravating and Mitigating
Factors}\label{aggravating-and-mitigating-factors}}

Identify whether the overall adjustment is up or down. For the court to
determine how much weight to assign to each of the factors.

If FPN was available, the reason why the offender did not take advantage
of the fixed penalty is a relevant consideration.

Consider both statutory and other aggravating factors, then factors
reducing seriousness and personal mitigation.

\hypertarget{reduction-for-assisting-prosecution}{%
\paragraph{3: Reduction for Assisting
Prosecution?}\label{reduction-for-assisting-prosecution}}

Any discounted sentence in consequence of assistance given/ offered to
the prosecutor (N.B. rare -- there is no formal system of plea
bargaining in the UK).

\hypertarget{reduction-for-guilty-pleas}{%
\paragraph{4: Reduction for Guilty
Pleas}\label{reduction-for-guilty-pleas}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{title: s 73 SC 2020}

\NormalTok{(1) This section applies where a court is determining what sentence to pass on an offender who has pleaded guilty to an offence in proceedings before that or another court.}

\NormalTok{(2) The court must take into account the following matters—}
\NormalTok{{-} (a) the **stage in the proceedings** for the offence at which the offender indicated the intention to plead guilty, and}
\NormalTok{{-} (b) the **circumstances** in which the indication was given.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea Definitive Guideline applies
to all adult Ds and to both the
\href{maximum\%20compensation\%20of\%20£5,000\%20per\%20offence}{{[}Magistrates'
Court{]}} and \href{no\%20financial\%20limit.}{{[}Crown Court{]}}.

\(\frac{1}{3}\) discount on sentence available:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  on a guilty plea in the magistrates' court;
\item
  on a guilty plea and committal for sentence;
\item
  on indication of a guilty plea to an indictable-only offence, followed
  by a guilty plea at first hearing in the Crown Court.
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{title: Committal}
\NormalTok{A committal for sentence happens when magistrates have found someone guilty of a crime but they think their sentencing powers are not enough. The magistrates transfer the case to the Crown Court where a higher sentence can be imposed.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\(\frac{1}{4}\) discount available at the plea and trial preparation
hearing stage (PTPH).

The guideline focuses on when a guilty plea is indicated, not when
entered. ``First part of proceedings'' means when D is first asked when
he intends to plead guilty at the
\href{maximum\%20compensation\%20of\%20£5,000\%20per\%20offence}{{[}Magistrates'
Court{]}} ({[}{[}R v Hodgin {[}2020{]} EWCA Crim 1388{]}{]}).

Any indication of a guilty plea must be \textbf{unequivocal}.

Other factors (e.g., assisting police) should be taken into account as
separate mitigating factors, not formally as the credit given for a
guilty plea.

\hypertarget{dangerousness}{%
\paragraph{5: Dangerousness}\label{dangerousness}}

If the offence is listed in Sch 15 and/or Sch 15B CJA 2003, the court
should consider whether it would be appropriate to impose a life
sentence or extended sentence.

\hypertarget{offenders-of-concern}{%
\paragraph{6: Offenders of Concern}\label{offenders-of-concern}}

Add a year in some cases.

\hypertarget{totality-principle}{%
\paragraph{7: Totality Principle}\label{totality-principle}}

If D sentenced for \(>1\) offence/ already serving a sentence, consider
whether the total sentence is just and proportionate to the overall
offending behaviour.

D sentenced for a particular offence may ask the court to take other
offences into consideration (TIC) when considering the sentence to be
imposed.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Often the additional offences will add nothing/ v little to the
  sentence
\item
  D wipes the slate clean and cannot subsequently be prosecuted for the
  other offences.
\item
  Police improve clear-up rates.
\end{itemize}

Generally, a court should not impose both a fine and a custodial
sentence. But this is OK if the sentence is a suspended custodial
sentence ({[}{[}R v Channer {[}2021{]} EWCA Crim 696{]}{]}).

\hypertarget{consider-whether-to-make-compensation-ancillary-orders}{%
\paragraph{8: Consider Whether to Make compensation/ Ancillary
Orders}\label{consider-whether-to-make-compensation-ancillary-orders}}

See above.

\hypertarget{reasons}{%
\paragraph{9: Reasons}\label{reasons}}

Give reasons and explain the effect of the sentence.

\hypertarget{consideration-for-time-on-bail}{%
\paragraph{10. Consideration for Time on
Bail}\label{consideration-for-time-on-bail}}

s 240A CJA 2003 -- used to be the case that tagged bail could count
towards time served.

\subsubsection{From Probation Service}\label{from-probation-service}}

s 31(1) SC 2020: pre-sentence report from probation service prepared
with a view to assisting the court in determining the most suitable
method of dealing with an offender.

Standard format of report. Report includes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Character references

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If D is of good character, can someone in a position of respect in
    the community provide a character reference?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Medical reports
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{magistrates-court}{%
\subsubsection{Magistrates' Court}\label{magistrates-court}}

{[}{[}sentencing-procedure.png{]}{]}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  D enters guilty plea or is convicted following trial
\item
  Court supplied with details of any offences D wishes to have taken
  into consideration.
\item
  Prosecuting solicitor supplies the court with a list of D's previous
  convictions.
\item
  Prosecuting solicitor ask for any ancillary orders.
\item
  D's solicitor addresses magistrates. May ask for adjournment (to get
  reports)
\item
  If case not adjourned,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    D's solicitor gives a plea in mitigation. May call character
    witnesses
  \item
    Magistrates sentence D
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If case adjourned

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Usually adjourned for 3-4 weeks.
  \item
    D released in bail/ remanded in custody
  \item
    Presumption of granting bail.
  \item
    When the case comes back, likely to be dealt with by a different
    bench of magistrates.
  \item
    Plea in mitigation and sentencing.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{crown-court}{%
\subsubsection{Crown Court}\label{crown-court}}

Pretty much the same as above

Usually if a judge adjourns a case for preparation of reports, they will
reserve the case to themselves to ensure they sentence D.

Again there is a presumption of bail.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{D must be told the reasons for and effect of the sentence imposed (s 52(1) SC 2020)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{conduct-1}{%
\subsection{Conduct}\label{conduct-1}}

D's solicitor should never be asked by the court to confirm the accuracy
of the list of D's previous convictions.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Duty not to deceive the court
\item
  Duty of confidentiality.
\end{itemize}

Good practice is to obtain details of previous convictions from the CPS
in advance of the sentencing hearing.

If client insists on pretending the list is accurate, solicitor must
cease to act.

      to help D overcome the addiction (rehabilitation requirement).
    \item
