# Defences

General defences can allow a defendant to avoid criminal liability, even if they have the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ of the relevant offence.

## Valid Defence

For a defendant to be criminally liable, they must have the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ of the relevant offence and the absence of a valid defencea justification or excuse for Dâ€™s behaviour. If a valid and complete defence exists, D will not be criminally liable. General defences are available to almost any crime, such as self-defence and intoxication. Some defences only operate in relation to specific crimes, such as the special defences of loss of control and diminished responsibility, which are available in relation to murder only.

If the defendant killed with diminished responsibility, D will not be acquitted but convicted of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, rather than murder. There are lots of other defences, general and specific, in addition to those covered in this element such as insanity/ automatism, duress, infancy and necessity.

Loss of control is a special defence because it is available for the charge of murder only. Loss of control is a partial defence because if successful, D will be convicted of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.

### Intoxication

The defendant may avoid criminal liability if intoxicated with drugs or alcohol. A defendant is more likely to be successful with an intoxication defence if involuntarily intoxicated rather than voluntarily intoxicated.

With involuntary intoxication (such as being drugged without consent), the court will ask did the defendant form the _mens rea_ even though intoxicated? [[Kingston [1995] 2 AC 355]].

With voluntary intoxication (such as getting drunk on alcohol), the rules are a little more complex. Essentially, with less serious crimes of basic intent (where recklessness is a form of _mens rea_ available), the defendant will be deemed reckless if they had foreseen the risk of harm if sober, [[Coley, McGhee and Harris [2013] EWCA Crim 233]].

### Consent

There are a variety of rules on consent. In the context of non-fatal offences against the person, the availability of consent will depend on the seriousness of the offence.

- If the offence is an assault or battery, consent is available if the victim consented or D honestly believed that V was consenting ([[AG Reference (No 6 of 1980) [1981] QB 715]]).
- If D intended to cause the offence of actual bodily harm or above, consent is not available ([[R v Brown [1994] 1 AC 212]]) unless some of the public interest exceptions apply: medical treatment, sport, horseplay, tattooing/ personal adornment and sexual gratification/ accidental infliction of harm.

### Self-defence

[[Self-defence]] can be used in protection of yourself, another or property. If successful, the defendant will be acquitted. It is a defence that is found in both common law and a statute, called the [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, s.76](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/76) (as amended).

The defendant is entitled to rely on the defence if:

- the defendant honestly believed that the use of force was necessary; and
- the level of force the defendant used in response was objectively reasonable in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.

### Mistake

While ignorance of the criminal law will not prevent criminal liability, the defendant may make a mistake of fact or civil law, which can mean that the _mens rea_ of the offence is not fulfilled and will escape criminal liability as a result. This could be a mistake of fact. If Ryan takes the wrong umbrella away from a restaurant, mistakenly believing it is his, he will not be liable for theft because he will not be dishonest.

## Summary

This element considered some general defences in overview which can allow a defendant to avoid criminal liability:

With involuntary intoxication, the court will ask did the defendant form the _mens rea_ even though intoxicated? **_Kingston_**. With voluntary intoxication and less serious crimes of basic intent, the defendant will be deemed reckless if they would have foreseen the risk of harm if sober, **_Coley, McGhee and Harris_**.

If the offence is an assault or battery, consent is available if the victim consented or D honestly believed that V was consenting, **_AG Reference (No 6 of 1980)_**. If D intended to cause the offence of actual bodily harm or above, consent is not available (**_R v Brown_**) unless some of the public interest exceptions apply: medical treatment, sport, horseplay, tattooing/ personal adornment and sexual gratification/ accidental infliction of harm.

A defendant is entitled to rely on self-defence if protecting themselves, another or property. The defendant must honestly believe that the use of force is necessary and the level of force the defendant uses in response is objectively reasonable in the circumstances as the defendant believes them to be.

While ignorance of the criminal law will not prevent criminal liability, the defendant may make a mistake of fact or civil law, which can mean that the _mens rea_ of the offence is not fulfilled and will escape criminal liability as a result.
