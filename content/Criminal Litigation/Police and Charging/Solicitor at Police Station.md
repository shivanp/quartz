# Solicitor at Police Station

```toc
```

A suspect who has been arrested and detained at the police station is entitled to free legal  
advice and to be represented by a solicitor (PACE 1984, s 58).

The solicitor’s only role in the police station is to protect and advance the legal rights of their client. On occasions, this may require the solicitor to give advice which has the effect of the client avoiding giving evidence which strengthens the prosecution case.

## Preparations

### Phone Contact

The solicitor will usually be telephoned by the Defence Solicitor Call Centre (DSCC) to say that a suspect who has been arrested wants the solicitor to attend the police station to represent him.

After speaking to the DSCC, the solicitor should speak to the client. The solicitor will need to identify themselves (if they have not represented the client on a previous occasion), ask the client to confirm that he wants the solicitor to come to the police station to represent him, and remind the client that any advice given will be free. The client should be advised to confine themselves to “yes/ no” answers to questions, in case the police can overhear.

### When

A solicitor is not obliged to attend the police station immediately after the initial telephone contact, even if the client has insisted that the solicitor attends straight away (e.g., if the police notify the solicitor that they will not interview until the client has sobered up).

The solicitor must attend if:

1. The offence is serious
2. The police intend to interview/ investigate straight away
3. The client is vulnerable (e.g., child)
4. Client complains of police mistreatment
5. Solicitor needs to make representations about the client's detention
6. Client needs to speak to solicitor in confidence.

Solicitor should check the law and check old files.

## Information Gathering

### Custody Officer

- Should allow the solicitor to view the custody record and detention log.
- Custody log should be used to obtain client's basic details and confirm other details (about the offence and practicalities).
- Code C, para 2.4A allows a legal representative or an appropriate adult to request a copy of the custody record when a detainee leaves police detention or is taken before a court.

### Investigating Officer

Solicitor should speak to the investigating officer to obtain:

- Facts of the case
- Disclosure
- Significant statements and/or silences
- Next steps.

### Disclosure

The police are not obliged to provide the solicitor with evidence, but will usually provide some of the details they have. Common today for the police to supply the solicitor with a disclosure statement summarising the evidence which the police have.

If the investigating officer refuses to make any disclosure, or discloses only a very limited amount of information, the solicitor should point out to him that in those circumstances the solicitor cannot properly advise the client as to the nature of the case against him and will only be able to advise the client to give a ‘no comment’ interview.

```ad-statute
title: para 11.1A, Code C
Before a person is interviewed, they and, if they are represented, their solicitor must be given sufficient information to enable them to understand the nature of any such offence, and why they are suspected of committing it.
```

### Significant statements/ Silences

Check whether there have been any.

### Next Steps

Solicitor must find out from the investigating officer what his intentions are. Ask the investigating officer about their views on bail.

### Client

The solicitor should speak to the client once they have obtained as much information as possible. They should discuss:

- The solicitor's identity and role
- Details of the alleged offence
- Client's instructions
- Next step in police investigation (usually an audibly recorded interview)
- Prepare the client for interview
	- Advising them whether or not to answer questions
	- Preparing a written statement on the client's behalf if the client is to give a 'no comment' interview
	- Advise the client on how the interview will be conducted.
	- Advise the client on the role the solicitor will play in the interview.

### Conduct

A solicitor may take instructions from a client who confirms that he has in fact committed the offence for which he has been arrested, but who wants to deny the offence when interviewed by the police. But the solicitor cannot attend the interview to represent the client if the client intends to deny having committed the offence (para 1.4 SRA Code, duty not to mislead the court).

If the client insists on giving false information in interview, the solicitor should decline to act any further on the client’s behalf.

### Conflict of Interest

A solicitor will often be asked to advise two (or more) individuals at the police station who are jointly suspected of having committed an offence. It is the responsibility of the  
solicitor to determine whether a conflict of interest exists.

Then speak to suspect 1. If their account suggests a conflict of interest, the solicitor should decline to act for the second suspect. If a conflict of interest emerges only after the solicitor has seen both suspects, the appropriate course of action is usually for the solicitor to withdraw from the case completely (unless they can act for S1 without breaching duty of confidentiality to S2).

If representing both suspects, they should not disclose anything between suspects unless:

1. Obtained the other client's consent in writing
2. Both clients are advancing the same defence
3. They consider it in the clients' interest for the information to be disclosed.

And always have regard to the overriding duty not to mislead the court.

```ad-important
Co-accused who are represented by the same solicitor may attempt to use that solicitor to pass information between each other so that they can jointly fabricate a defence and give the police a consistent ‘story’. To guard against this, the solicitor should ensure that before telling the second client what they have been told by the first client, they obtain an account of the second client’s version of events.
```

### Disclosure to TP

A solicitor representing a client at the police station may be asked for details of their client’s defence by another solicitor representing a co-accused who has been arrested in connection with the same matter. Such a request should be treated with caution.

### Withdraw From Acting

If withdrawing for professional reasons, the solicitor should:

1. Explain to the client why they cannot represent him
2. Tell the client he is entitled to free legal advice from another solicitor of his choice or the duty solicitor
3. Tell the client that the solicitor owes the client an ongoing duty of confidentiality
4. Tell the custody officer that they are no longer able to act.

## Should the Suspect Answer Questions

The reason for the police wanting to interview a suspect is their hope that the suspect will ‘crack’ and say something incriminating when put under the pressure of an interview situation.

Client has 4 options:

1. To answer all questions
2. To give a no comment interview
3. Selective silence
4. No comment interview but hand a written statement to the police setting out the facts relied upon in defence at trial.

| Option               | Advantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Answer questions     | Client can put the record straight. Police may decide not to pursue the case further. Credibility of evidence at trial boosted if story consistent from the start. If admitting guilt, answering questions at the interview may help police to deal with the matter using a caution.                                    | Suspect may say something incriminating/ make comments undermining credibility. Transcript of the interview will be read out at court if the suspect is charged and pleads non-guilty. Consider whether the police have sufficiently disclosed evidence. A common tactic is putting a new piece of information to the suspect in the interview. Client may attack the character of another, which may enable to CPS to raise in evidence any previous convictions the client may have. |
| No comment interview | No danger of incrimination. Useful tactic if the police have little evidence - client likely to be released without charge.                                                                                                                                                                                             | If the client is charged and pleads not guilty, the magistrate or jury may draw adverse inference. If client fails to answer questions in police interview and raises a new defence at trial, the court/ jury are entitled to conclude that the defence is a sham.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Written statement    | Client needs to place his version of events on record, but may perform badly under interview (if young, emotional, or first conviction). Avoids adverse inferences under s 34 CJPOA 1994 **if it sets out all the facts**. The statement should say no more than is necessary to prevent the drawing of adverse inferences. | Gives the police extra information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

```ad-important
- If advising a "no comment" interview, make a full written note of the reasons for advising this. This may become evidence at trial. 
- If producing a written statement, standard practice is to hand it to the police during the interview. But hand it in after the police have decided to charge the suspect, if the evidence against them is particularly weak (to avoid the statement containing a partial admission which means the suspect can be charged). 
- Solicitor will occasionally take a written statement but keep it on file rather than handing it to the police, if the defence is existent but weak/ has plot holes.

## Preparing Client for Interview

Explain to the client:

1. Interview will be audibly recorded and parties asked to identify themselves
2. Interview may be stopped at any time if the client requires further legal advice.
3. Solicitor will be present in the interview to protect the client's interest
4. If the client is to remain silent, should say "no comment" for each question asked
5. Police will use tactics:
	1. Asking innocuous questions
	2. Suggest legal advice received is incorrect
	3. Warn him that consequences will arise unless questions are answered.
6. Client should not lose their cool
7. Client should not make personal attacks on others during the interview.

## Charge and Bail After Charge

- If it seems there is insufficient evidence to charge, the solicitor should draw this to the attention of the investigating and custody officer.
- If there is sufficient evidence, consider making representations to the police that the client should be dealt with in other ways
	- e.g., informal warning, penalty notice, simple or conditional caution.
- If the custody officer indicates that she is minded to refuse bail, the suspect’s solicitor should consider making representations in support of bail being granted.

## Police Station Representative Accreditation Scheme

A suspect who is detained at the police station may receive legal advice from a solicitor or an accredited police station representative.

The aim of the Police Station Representative Accreditation Scheme is to certify non-solicitors to advise and assist suspects being held at a police station, and to allow them to claim payment from the LAA for having provided such assistance.

Possible to become accredited as a trainee solicitor.
