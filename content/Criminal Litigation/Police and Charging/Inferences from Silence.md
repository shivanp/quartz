# Inferences From Silence

```toc
```

## Right to Silence

Suspects have a right to remain silent when interviewed at the police station. Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (CJPOA) 1994, when a defendant’s case comes to trial, the court may be permitted to draw what are termed ‘adverse inferences’ from his earlier silence when being questioned about the offence.

Possible inferences:

1. Recent fabrication: the defendant remained silent when interviewed by the police because he had no adequate explanation for his conduct.
2. Lack of confidence in defence: suspect did not believe that defence would stand up to further investigation by the police.

A defendant’s silence when interviewed by the police cannot on its own prove guilt (CJPOA 1994, s 38(3)).

The court is not permitted to draw an adverse inference from a defendant’s silence if that silence occurred at a time when the defendant had not been allowed the opportunity to consult a solicitor to obtain independent legal advice (Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, s 58).

## S 34 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994

```ad-statute
title: s 34 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994
(1) Where, in any proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the accused—
- (a) at any time before he was charged with the offence, on being questioned under caution by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom the offence had been committed, failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings; or
- (b) on being charged with the offence or officially informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such fact,
- (c) at any time after being charged with the offence, on being questioned under section 22 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (post-charge questioning), failed to mention any such fact,

being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed... the court or jury... may draw such inferencese from the failure as appear proper. 
```

The terms of s 34 may be satisfied even where a defendant has answered every question put to him, if at trial he raises some other fact in his defence that he did not mention, but could reasonably have been expected to mention, when interviewed.

## Conditions

Before adverse inferences could be drawn from a defendant’s silence in police interview, conditions in [[R v Argent [1997] 2 Cr App R 27]] must be satisfied:

1. the interview had to be an interview under caution;
2. the defendant had to fail to mention any fact later relied on in his defence at trial;
3. the failure to mention this fact had to occur before the defendant was charged;
4. the questioning of the defendant at the interview in which the defendant failed to mention the fact had to be directed to trying to discover whether or by whom the alleged offence had been committed; and
5. the fact which the defendant failed to mention had to be a fact which, in the circumstances existing at the time, the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention when questioned.

A jury should be directed that an adverse inference from a defendant’s silence could be drawn only if the court was satisfied that the real reason for the defendant’s silence was that he had no answer to the questions that were being put to him, or no answer that would stand up to scrutiny ([[Condron v UK (2001) 31 EHRR 1]]).

If a defendant remained silent during his initial interview at the police station and then answered questions during a subsequent interview, inferences from his failure to answer questions in the first interview might still be drawn at trial ([[R v Betts and Hall [2001] 2 Cr App R 257]]).

If a defendant places his factual defence on record when interviewed by the police, a court will not draw an adverse inference if he says nothing when he is subsequently charged (s s 34(1)(b) is not really used in practice).

### Directions to Jury

Jury are told to make the inference only if they think it a fair and proper conclusion, and they are satisfied that:

- When interviewed, D could reasonably have been expected to mention the facts on which he now relies on in his defence at trial;
- The only sensible explanation is he had no answer at the time or none that would stand up to scrutiny; and
- Apart from the failure to mention facts, the prosecution's case against him is so strong that it clearly calls for an answer.

## Use of Written Statement

Allows the client’s version of events to be set out in a clear and logical way. If there is “staged” disclosure of evidence in the interview by the police, the solicitor may stop the interview to prepare further written statements on D's behalf.

The purpose of s 34 was to encourage defendants to make an early disclosure of their defence to the police, not to permit the police to scrutinise and test that defence in interview ([[R v Knight [2003] EWCA Crim 1977]]). So D is free to answer “no comment” to everything after handing in a written statement.

When a defence solicitor prepares a written statement for their client but does not hand this in to the police , whilst this will prevent the court at trial from drawing the inference of recent fabrication, it will not prevent the court from drawing an inference that the defendant was not sufficiently confident about his defence to expose this to investigation by the police following the interview.

## Advising Silence

Solicitor may advise the client to remain silent:

- If the police have not given sufficient disclosure
- If the nature of the case is particularly complex/ relates to events occurring a long time ago
- Personal circumstances of the suspect.

```ad-test
title: Advising silence adverse inference
Staying silent at a police interview under legal advice does not automatically prevent the court drawing an adverse inference. But the fact that D was advised not to answer questions in the police station must be given appropriate weight at trial ([[Condron v UK [2000] Crim LR 679]]). In this case, the court will ask whether the facts relied on in trial were facts which the defendant could reasonably have been expected to mention in police interview. The jury will now be directed by the trial judge that adverse inferences should not be drawn under s 34 if the jury believe that the defendant genuinely and reasonably relied on the legal advice to remain silent.
```

## Legal Privilege

At trial, a defendant may give evidence which has the effect of waiving privilege and allowing the prosecution to cross-examine him about reasons for the legal advice that he was given.

- If D gives evidence that he remained silent in interview following advice from solicitor, this will not waive privilege.
- If an adverse inference is to be avoided, the court is likely to want to know the reasons for the solicitor’s advice.
- Once a defendant gives this information, privilege is waived ([[R v Bowden [1999] 1 WLR 823]]).
- So can be cross-examined as to the reason for the solicitor's decision to advise him to remain silent.

```ad-action
title: Big brain strategy
- When giving evidence-in-chief, D says nothing about the reason for his silence when interviewed
- Prosecution during cross-examination allege D fabricated his defence. 
- D tells court that he disclosed his defence to the solicitor whilst at the police station, but the solicitor advised him to remain silent for other reasons. 
- D will not waive privilege ([[R v Loizou [2006] EWCA Crim 1719]])
```

In the absence of a waiver of privilege by a defendant, no questions could be asked which would in effect require the defendant to waive his privilege or be criticised for not doing so ([[R v Seaton [2010] EWCA Crim 1980]]).

```ad-action
title: Big brain strategy 2
Many solicitors who advise a client to remain silent in interview now give such advice on tape at the start of the interview:
> I now advise you to remain silent because … [the disclosure given by the police is so limited that I cannot properly advise you/I do not consider you to be in a fit state to be interviewed/the offences you are alleged to have committed occurred so long ago or are so complex that you cannot be expected to give an immediate response, etc].
```

This does not amount to a waiver of privilege because the advice is being given to the client there and then.

Where a solicitor, in the presence of their client, gives a statement that they had advised their client not to comment during police interviews and provides the particular reason for doing so, privilege will be waived on the basis that the solicitor is acting as the client’s agent ([[R v Hall-Chung [2007] All ER (D) 429 (Jul)]]).
