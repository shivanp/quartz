## Procedure

A suspect who has been arrested must be taken to the police station “as soon as is practicable after the arrest” (s 30(1A) PACE 1984) unless the arresting officer decides to grant “street bail”.

- A suspect may be arrested at the police station.
- If the police do not have sufficient evidence to arrest a suspect, they may ask the person to attend voluntarily to the police station to ask questions.
	- s 29 PACE 1984: rights of a volunteer
	- Can leave at any time
	- Can request a friend/ solicitor be present at the interview.
- para 1.1 Code C: all persons in custody must be dealt with expeditiously, and be released as soon as the need for detention no longer applies.

### Custody Officer

The arrested suspect must be brought before a custody officer on his arrival at the police station. Responsible for authorising the detention of the suspect and supervising his welfare whilst at the police station. Normally a police officer of rank sergeant or above who is not involved in the investigation.

para 2.1A Code C: suspect who is arrested should be brought before the custody officer "as soon as is practicable".

#### Initial Steps

The custody officer should file a custody record, detailing:

- Suspect's details
- Offence for which the suspect has been arrested and why the arresting officer considered it necessary to arrest the suspect
- Time of suspect's arrest and arrival at station
- Reason why the suspect's ongoing detention had been authorised by the custody officer.
- Time detention authorised
- Confirmation that the suspect had been given details of the rights he may exercise
- Details of any items of property the suspect has on his person
- Details of medical conditions.

Custody officer may inform the suspect of his ongoing rights which may be exercised at any time while in custody:

- Right to have someone informed of suspect's arrest (s 56)
- Right for the suspect to consult privately with a solicitor (free legal advice available – s 58)
- Right to consult the Codes of Practice.
- Right to be informed about the offence and why they have been arrested and detained.

#### Search of Detained Person

Custody officer may search the suspect/ authorise a search of the suspect, to the extent considered necessary (para 4.1 Code C). Items on the suspect's person should be recorded (s 54(1) and (2)).

Section 54(3) permits the custody officer to seize and retain any items the suspect has on his person. Clothing and personal items can be taken if:

1. The custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that they may be evidence
2. The custody officer believes the suspect may use them:
	1. To cause physical injury
	2. To cause damage to property
	3. To interfere with evidence
	4. To assist in escaping (Code C, para 4.2).

## Detention at Police Station

### Sufficient Evidence

The custody officer must determine whether there is already sufficient evidence to charge the suspect with the offence for which he has been arrested (s 37(1)). Will ask the investigating officer for details of the evidence that already exists against the suspect, and what steps the officer proposes to take if the further detention of the suspect is authorised.

The custody officer should note in the custody record any comments made by the suspect in relation to the account given by the arresting officer of the reasons for the arrest (Code C, para 3.4). The custody officer should not himself put any questions to the arrested person about his involvement in any offence (Code C, para 3.4).

The custody officer may detain the suspect at the police station for as long as it is necessary for him to determine if sufficient evidence exists to charge the suspect.

### Grounds for Detention

If there is insufficient evidence, the suspect should be released with/ without bail unless:

1. The custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that detaining the suspect without charge is necessary to secure/ preserve evidence relating to an offence
	1. Useful if the police want to search the suspect's premises, under s 18.
2. It is necessary to obtain such evidence by questioning (s 37(2)).

If the custody officer becomes aware at any time that the grounds on which a suspect’s  
detention was authorised have ceased to apply, the suspect must be released immediately (s 39).

### Conditions of Detention

- The cell in which a suspect is held must be adequately heated, cleaned and ventilated, and also adequately lit (Code C, para 8.2).
- Any bedding supplied to a suspect must be of a reasonable standard and in a clean and sanitary condition (Code C, para 8.3).
- A suspect must be provided with access to toilet and washing facilities (Code C, para 8.4).
- A suspect must be offered at least two light meals and one main meal in any 24-hour period, and drinks should be provided at meal times and upon reasonable request between meals (Code C, para 8.6 and Note for Guidance 8B).
- A suspect should be offered brief outdoor exercise daily if this is practicable (Code C, para 8.7).
- Suspects should be visited in their cells at least every hour (Code C, para 9.3).
- If a suspect is injured/ appears to need clinical attention, the custody officer must make arrangements to ensure that the suspect receives appropriate clinical attention as soon as reasonably practicable (Code C, paras 9.5, 9.5A and Annexes G and H).

### Periods of Detention

#### Maximum Period

Section 41 provides that a person ‘shall not be kept in police detention for more than 24 hours without being charged’. This 24-hour period begins from the ‘relevant time’.

```ad-defn
title: Relevant time
1. In the case of a person attending voluntarily at the police station who is then arrested at the police station, the time of his arrest (s 41(2)(c));
2. In the case of a person who attends a police station to answer ‘street bail’ granted under s 30A, the time when he arrives at the police station (s 41(2)(ca));
3. In any other case, the relevant time is the time when the suspect arrested arrives at the first police station to which he is taken after his arrest (s 41(1)(d)).
```

#### Extending Maximum Period

Under s 42, the police have the power to extend the period of a suspect’s detention in the  
police station up to a period of 36 hours from the ‘relevant time’ if an officer of superintendent or above has reasonable grounds for believing that:

1. Detention necessary to secure or preserve evidence relating to an offence for which the suspect is under arrest
2. The offence is an indictable offence (either way or indictable only); and
3. The investigation is being carried out diligently and expeditiously.

#### Further Extensions

The police are able to obtain a warrant of further detention from a magistrates’ court if the magistrate considers that there are ‘reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention of the person to whom the application relates is justified’ (s 43(1)). If the magistrates are persuaded to grant a warrant of further detention, this can be for such period of time as the magistrates think fit, but up to a maximum period of 36 hours.

In exceptional cases, the police may make an additional application to a magistrates’ court under s 44 for an extension of the warrant of further detention granted under s 43.

```ad-note
The police can detain a suspect in police custody for a maximum period of four days before that suspect must be either released or charged.
```

#### Detention Reviews

The police are obliged to carry out periodic reviews of the suspect’s detention to ensure that the grounds on which the detention was initially authorised by the custody officer are still applicable (s 40). This is a mandatory requirement. If not done, any detention after this time is unlawful and amounts to the tort of false imprisonment ([[Roberts v Chief Constable of the Cheshire Constabulary [1999] 1 WLR 662]]). Reviews of detention that take place before a suspect is charged are carried out by an officer of at least the rank of inspector who is not directly involved in the investigation (s 40(2)(b)).

The first review must take place no later than six hours after **the custody officer first authorised the detention of the suspect.** Note this is not 6 hours after the relevant time.

## Rights of the Suspect

### Right to Have Someone Informed of the Arrest

```ad-statute
title: s 56 - Right to have someone informed when arrested.
(1) Where a person has been arrested and is being held in custody in a police station or other premises, he shall be entitled, if he so requests, to have one friend or relative or other person who is known to him or who is likely to take an interest in his welfare told, as soon as is practicable except to the extent that delay is permitted by this section, that he has been arrested and is being detained there. 

(2) Delay is only permitted—
- (a) in the case of a person who is in police detention for an indictable offence ; and
- (b) if an officer of at least the rank of inspector authorises it.

(3) In any case the person in custody must be permitted to exercise the right conferred by subsection (1) above within 36 hours from the relevant time, as defined in section 41(2) above.

(4) An officer may give an authorisation under subsection (2) above orally or in writing but, if he gives it orally, he shall confirm it in writing as soon as is practicable.

(5) An officer may only authorise delay where he has reasonable grounds for believing that telling the named person of the arrest—
- (a) will lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with an indictable offence or interference with or physical injury to other persons; or
- (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having committed such an offence but not yet arrested for it; or
- (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such an offence.
```

### Right to Legal Advice

```ad-statute
title: s 58(1)
A person arrested and held in custody in a police station or other premises shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor privately at any time.
```

Free, independent legal advice is available. Unless a suspect asks for legal advice to be paid for by himself, the police must contact the Defence Solicitor Call Centre (DSCC) – even if the suspect has asked for a named solicitor or firm. The DSCC will then determine whether the case is such that telephone advice is sufficient or whether a solicitor should attend.

- Telephone advice, where appropriate, is provided for free through Criminal Defence Direct (CDD).
- Should attendance be required, the suspect’s own solicitor, or the duty solicitor (if the suspect has not specified a particular solicitor), will be notified.
- If a solicitor attends the police station to see a particular suspect, that suspect must be informed of the solicitor’s arrival at the police station (whether or not he is being interviewed at the time of the solicitor’s arrival).
- At no time should a police officer do or say anything with the intention of dissuading a person from obtaining legal advice (Code C, para 6.4).
- No police officer or police staff shall indicate to any suspect, except to answer a direct question, that the period for which he is liable to be detained, or, if not detained, the time taken to complete the interview, might be reduced if he does not ask for legal advice or does not want a solicitor present when being interviewed (para 6ZA of the Notes for Guidance to Code C)

### Delaying Right to Legal Advice

The police have a very limited right to delay the exercise of this right. Any delay must be authorised by an officer with at least the rank of superintendent, and can be authorised only when a suspect has been arrested for an indictable offence (s 58(6)). The length of any delay can be for a maximum of 36 hours from the relevant time (s 58(5)).

A police officer may authorise a delay in the suspect receiving access to legal advice only if he  
has reasonable grounds for believing that the exercise of this right will:

1. Lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with an indictable offence, or interference with or physical injury to other persons.
2. Lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having committed an offence but not arrested
3. Hinder the recovery of property obtained as a result of such an offence (s 58(8)).

## Interviews and Identification Evidence

The investigating officer may:

- Carry out an audibly recorded interview with the suspect about the suspect's alleged involvement in the offence
- Carry out identification procedure to see if a witness/ victim is able to recognise the suspect
- Take fingerprints from the suspect
- Take samples from the suspect
- Take photos of the suspect.

### Interviews

Interviews are tape recorded, usually on two tapes. The master tape is sealed in the presence of the suspect at the end of the interview. The other tape is the working copy – used by the police to prepare a written summary or transcript of the interview. Some police forces produce a third tape for D's solicitor (if charged).

#### Appropriateness

Interviews should not be carried out when the suspect appears unable to (para 11.18(b), Code C)

1. Appreciate the significance of questions or answers
2. Understand what is happening because of intoxication/ illness.

### Start of the Interview

1. Caution
	- The police officer will caution the suspect.
	- Right to remain silence, though the court may draw adverse inferences from such silence.
	- A special caution will be given if the interviewing officer wants the suspect to account for an object/ substance/ mark found on his person/ in his possession.
	- If the special caution is given and the suspect then fails to answer the question (or to answer the question satisfactorily), the court at trial will be able to draw an adverse inference from this pursuant to ss 36–37 of the CJPOA 1994. Suspect must be informed
		- What offence is being investigated
		- What fact the suspect is being asked to account for
		- This fact may be due to the suspect taking part in the commission of the offence
		- A court may draw a proper inference if the suspect fails/ refused to account for the fact
		- Record of the interview may be given in evidence if the suspect if brought to trial.
	- Suspect reminded that he is entitled to free and independent legal advice.
2. Significant statements and silence
	- Must put to the suspect any significant statement or silence which occurred in the presence and hearing of a police officer before the start of the interview (Code C para 11.4)
	- Suspect asked to confirm/ deny the earlier statement/ silence, and if he has anything to add.
	- A ‘significant statement’ is a statement which appears capable of being used in evidence against the suspect at trial, in particular a direct admission of guilt.
	- A ‘significant silence’ is a failure or refusal to answer a question or to answer satisfactorily when under caution, which might allow the court to draw adverse inferences from that silence at trial.
	- Should the police officer fail to put to a suspect at the start of the interview a significant statement or silence made outside the police station, this may result in the contents of that statement or the nature of that silence being ruled inadmissible at trial under s 78 of PACE 1984

#### Conduct of Interview

Paragraph 11.5 Code C provides: ‘No interviewer may try to obtain answers or elicit a statement by the use of oppression.’ Oppression involves shouting, making threatening gestures, leaning over the suspect, standing over the suspect etc.

Paragraph 11.5 also states that ‘no interviewer shall indicate, except to answer a direct question, what action will be taken by the police if the person being questioned answers questions, makes a statement or refuses to do either’.

If interviews with a suspect take place over more than one day, in any period of 24 hours the suspect must be given a continuous period of at least eight hours for rest (usually at night) which is free from questioning or any other interruption (Code C para 12.2).

Breaks from interviews should take place at recognised meal times, and short refreshment breaks should be taken at approximately two-hour intervals (Code C, para 12.8).

#### Interview Before Legal Advice

Generally, a suspect who requires legal advice should not be interviewed until such advice has been received (Code C para 6.6).

Exceptions:

- s 58 allows the police to delay a suspect's receiving any legal advice for up to 36 hours. The police will usually want to interview the suspect in this period.
- If an officer of rank $\geq$ superintendent reasonably believes that the delay would be caused by the time taken to obtain legal advice would:
	- Lead to interference with/ harm to evidence
	- Interference with/ physical harm to other people
	- Serious loss of/ damage to property
	- Alerting other people suspected of having committed an offence but not arrested
	- Hinder the recovery of property obtained in consequence of the commission of an offence (Code C para 6.6(b)(i)).
- If the relevant solicitor has agreed to attend the police station, but awaiting their arrival would ‘cause unreasonable delay to the process of investigation’ (Code C, para 6.6(b)(ii))
- If the solicitor the suspect has asked to speak to either cannot be contacted or has declined to attend the police station, and the suspect has then declined the opportunity to consult the duty solicitor (Code C, para 6.6(c))
- If the solicitor asks for legal advice, changes his mind, and certain conditions are satisfied (about an inspector or higher speaking to the suspect and being satisfied that it proper for the interview to go ahead).

If there is no solicitor present when the suspect wants one, at the start of the interview, the suspect will be cautioned that ‘You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be given in evidence.’

```ad-statute
title: s 58 Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999
No adverse inferences may be drawn at trial from the suspect’s silence in interview if the suspect had not at the time of the interview been allowed access to legal advice.
```

## Charging Suspect

Once the suspect has been investigated, the custody officer has 4 options:

1. Release the suspect without charge and without bail
2. Release the suspect without charge but on bail whilst the police make further enquiries
3. Release the suspect without charge but on bail
4. Charge the suspect.

### Release without Charge and without Bail

Appropriate if the police determine that the suspect did not commit the crime under investigation, or there is insufficient evidence and unlikely that any further evidence will be obtained.

### Release on Bail While the Police Make Enquiries

The police can release the suspect on bail under s 47(3)(b) if there is insufficient evidence to charge the suspect and the police need to make further enquiries.

ss 52–67 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 have amended PACE 1984 and effectively introduced a presumption of release without bail where the police have no evidence upon which to charge.

The presumption does not apply if:

1. The case has been submitted to the CPS for a charging decision, or
2. The custody officer is satisfied that releasing the suspect on bail is necessary and proportionate in all the circumstances, and an officer $\geq$ inspector authorises the release on bail.

Where it is necessary and proportionate to bail the suspect, a maximum period of 28 days applies. This can be extended once up to 3 months (if $\geq$ superintendent authorises), or by the court for another 3 months in exceptional cases (PACE 1984, ss 47ZD–47ZG).

Where a suspect is released on bail, details of the time and date when the suspect needs to reattend the police station will be contained in a written notice which will be given to him by the police.

If the suspect fails to answer his bail at the police station, he may be arrested without warrant (s 46A). Although failing to answer bail at the police station is technically a criminal offence, it is very rare in practice for the police to charge a suspect with this offence.

The police may impose conditions on bail granted to a suspect whilst the police make further enquiries into the alleged offence (s 47(1A)).

### Release on Bail While CPS Investigates

s 37B of PACE 1984 provides that it is for the CPS to determine whether the suspect should be charged and, if so, with what offence. Once the police believe there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, the police will need to send the case papers to the CPS for it to determine the exact charge.

In more complex cases, the CPS may be unable to make an immediate decision on charge. It will take several weeks for the CPS to review a file, and the police will therefore need to release the suspect on bail under s 47(3)(b) whilst this is done.

The police may impose conditions on a suspect who is released on bail pending consultations with the CPS (s 47(1A)).

#### Threshold Test

If:

1. CPS lawyer believes it may not be appropriate to release a suspect on bail after charge, and
2. Insufficient evidence to apply the two-part test

the lawyer may apply the “Threshold Test”. Involves deciding whether there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed an offence, and whether it is in the public interest to charge D.

Full Test must be applied as soon as is practicable.

### Charging Procedure

Usual practice: police refer the case to CPS for it to determine the appropriate charge.

When a decision has been made to charge a suspect, the suspect will be formally charged at the police station. In accordance with para 16.2 of Code C, the suspect must be cautioned on charge and anything the suspect says in response to the charge should be written down.

> You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention now something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

The suspect should also be given a written notice ("charge sheet") giving the particulars of offence.

#### Further Interviews

After the charge, police cannot interview, except:

- To prevent or minimise harm
- To clear up ambiguity in a previous answer
- In the interest of justice for the suspect to have him comment on information concerning the offence coming to light since he was charged.

## Bail After Charge

### Denying Bail

Where a suspect is charged, the custody officer must decide whether to:

- Keep him in police custody before trial
- Release him on bail with or without conditions (s 38(1))

Bail can only be denied when (s 38(1)(a)):

- Name/ address given are doubted/ not given
- Custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that:
	- He will fail to appear in court to answer bail
	- Necessary to prevent him committing an offence
	- Necessary to obtain a sample
	- Necessary to prevent him causing physical injury/ loss or damage to property
	- Necessary to prevent him from interfering with administration of justice/ investigation.
	- Necessary for his own protection.

### Conditional Bail

If the custody officer decides to grant bail to a suspect who has been charged, he must then decide whether it is necessary to impose conditions on that bail (PACE 1984, s 47(1A)). Conditions must be necessary.

The custody officer cannot impose a condition that a suspect reside at a bail hostel, undergo medical examination or see his legal adviser.

Usual conditions are:

1. to reside at a particular address;
2. not to speak to or contact any witnesses;
3. not to enter a particular area or set of premises; or
4. to observe a curfew at night between specified hours.

If a suspect wants these conditions varied, he can:

1. Ask the custody officer to vary the conditions (Bail Act 1976, s 3A(4))
2. Make an application to the magistrates' court for the conditions to be varied (Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, s 43(B)(1) and CrimPR, r 14.6).

### First Court Appearance

| Bail scenario                        | Court appearance                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suspect granted police bail          | First sitting of the court, unless the court is too busy. Likely to be 1-2 weeks.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Suspect denied police bail           | Not later than the first sitting of the court after he is charged with the offence (s 46(2)). Normally within 24 hours.                                                                                                            |
| Breaching police bail (after charge) | s 7(3) Bail Act 1976: police officer can arrest person if he believes the person is unlikely to surrender to custody or the person has breached/ likely to breach bail. Must be brought before magistrates' court within 24 hours. |

## Alternatives to Charging

Alternatives include:

1. An informal warning
2. A penalty notice
3. A formal caution
4. A conditional caution.

### Informal Warnings

In minor cases, the police have always had discretion to release a suspect without charge but to give him an informal warning about his future conduct.

### Penalty Notices

The police may issue a penalty notice to dispose of minor offences without the need for the offender to go to court:

- Fixed Penalty Notice for minor road traffic offences/ littering/ dog fouling
	- Not a criminal conviction.
- Penalty Notices for Disorder for anti-social behaviour like being drunk and disorderly.
	- Requires paying a fine
	- An offender can dispute the notice in the magistrates' court
- s 132 of LASPO 2012 allows for the issuing of penalty notices with an education option on persons aged over 18, in areas where educational course schemes have been established.

### Simple Cautions

Instead of giving an informal warning, the police (in conjunction with the CPS) may instead  
decide to issue a simple caution. A record of the caution is kept, and may be mentioned in court when determining sentencing for a future offence.

Given in a police station by an officer $\geq$ inspector. Conditions:

1. sufficient evidence must have been collected to have justified a prosecution;
2. there must be clear and reliable evidence of a voluntary admission by the offender that he has committed the offence;
3. the offender must agree to being cautioned, having been made aware that the caution might be raised in court were he to be convicted of a later offence.

Section 17(2) of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 restricts the use of simple cautions for indictable-only offences to those where a police officer $\geq$ superintendent determines there are exceptional circumstances relating to D or the offence.

| Type of offence         | Caution available?                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Summary                 | Yes                                                                                                                      |
| Either way offence      | s 17(3) Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015: no unless $\geq$ inspector determines there are exceptional circumstances. |
| Indictable only offence | s 17(2) CJCA 2015: no unless $\geq$ superintendent determines there are exceptional circumstances and CPS agrees.                                                                                                                        |

s 17(4) CJCA 2015 restricts the use of simple cautions for repeat offending.

### Conditional Cautions

- Manifestation of “restorative justice”.
- Do not replace the police caution system
- Must only be used with the approval of the CPS.
- s 22 CJA 2003: can be given to a person aged $\geq 18$, provided s 23 requirements are satisfied. Conditions must have the objective of:
	- Facilitating rehabilitation of the offender
	- Ensuring reparation is made for the offence
	- Punishing the offender.

Conditions:

- there must be evidence that the offender has committed an offence;
- relevant prosecutor or an authorised person must determine that there is sufficient evidence to charge the offender with the offence
- the offender must admit that he committed the offence;
- the effect of the conditional caution must be explained to the offender along with a warning for non-compliance
- the offender must sign a document containing the details of the offence, an admission that he committed the offence, his consent to a conditional caution and the conditions attached to the caution (CJA 2003, s 23).

If an offender fails "without reasonable excuse" to comply with any conditions, may be arrested and prosecuted for the original offence (s 25 CJA 2003). The conditions that are likely to be attached to cautions will be geared either towards rehabilitating the offender, or towards the offender making reparation to his victim.

### Disadvantages

1. A caution is a formal recorded admission of guilt which will stay on the offender's record
2. The client will almost certainly lose the opportunity to receive a caution subsequently
3. Existence of the caution disclosable on certain job applications (particularly professional ones).
4. If the offence is sexual, the client will be placed on the sex offenders register
5. Police may retain fingerprints and other identification.

A client should accept a caution only if he accepts his guilt and there is sufficient evidence against him. If there is insufficient evidence, the CPS may choose not to prosecute.

## Commencing a Case without Charge

For minor summary only offences, a suspect may not have been arrested by the police and may not even have needed to attend the police station. A prosecutor can send the person a “written charge” of the offence (s 29(1) CJA 2003). The prosecutor must also send the person charged a document called a ‘requisition’ or single justice procedure notice, requiring that the person appear before a magistrates’ court at a given time and place (CJA 2003, s 29(2)).

## Complaints About Police

Can formally complain to the relevant police force. The police force will decide whether to record the complaint. If recorded, the police force may refer complaints to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). If not referred, it will be dealt with either by local resolution or local investigation. There is a right of appeal against a police decision not to record the complaint or the outcome of a local resolution/ investigation.

In serious cases of police misconduct, the CPS may start criminal proceedings.
