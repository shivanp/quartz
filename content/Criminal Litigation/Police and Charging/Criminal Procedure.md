## Key Personnel

### Defence Solicitors

Most defendants will be represented by a solicitor. The defence solicitor will provide advice and assistance to a suspect in the police station, before the suspect is charged. If the suspect is charged, the defence solicitor will represent them in the magistrates' / Crown Court.

### Police

Investigate criminal offences. Includes power to stop and search suspected offenders, powers to search premises and the power to arrest suspects. The police have additional powers following an arrest.

The National Crime Agency investigates serious, organised and complex crime.

### CPS

Responsible for prosecuting individuals. The head of CPS is the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Responsibility for deciding the charge the suspect faces rests with the CPS rather than the police. Representatives from the CPS are based in police stations.

After a suspect has been charged, the CPS retains responsibility for the prosecution of the case. CPS is an independent organisation.

A prosecution should be brought if:

1. There is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and
2. It is in the public interest for a prosecution to be brought.

### Magistrates' Court

### Crown Court

### Probation Service

Representative always present in court when a case is being heard. Responsible for compiling pre-sentence reports on a defendant who has been convicted. Focus on D's background, previous convictions and likelihood of re-offending.

### Criminal Legal Aid

Legal Aid Agency (LLA) provides funding for Ds either by entering a “standard crime contract” with solicitors in private practice, or providing salaried public defenders.

## Classification of Offences

### Indictable-only Offences

- Most serious form of criminal offence
- Magistrate will immediately send the case to the Crown Court for trial.
- e.g., murder, rape, robbery

### Either Way Offences

- If the magistrate decides to keep the case before them, D has the right to elect trial by a judge and jury in the Crown Court.
- e.g., theft, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, burglary.
- Low-value shoplifting (value of the stolen goods is $<£200$) is a summary offence (s 22A Magistrates' Courts Act 1980) but if an adult D pleads not guilty, can elect a Crown Court trial.

### Summary Offences

Least serious form of criminal offence, dealt with only by the magistrates' court.

## Criminal Procedure Rules

April 2005 – procedural rules for criminal court consolidated into the CrimPR, as supplemented by the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction.

### Overriding Objective

```ad-statute
title: r 1.1 Criminal Procedure Rules 2020 - The overriding objective

(1) The overriding objective of this procedural code is that criminal cases be dealt with justly.

(2) Dealing with a criminal case justly includes―
- (a) acquitting the innocent and convicting the guilty;
- (b) dealing with the prosecution and the defence fairly;
- (c) recognising the rights of a defendant, particularly those under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights;
- (d) respecting the interests of witnesses, victims and jurors and keeping them informed of the progress of the case;
- (e) dealing with the case efficiently and expeditiously;
- (f) ensuring that appropriate information is available to the court when bail and sentence are considered; and
- (g) dealing with the case in ways that take into account―
	- (i) the gravity of the offence alleged,
	- (ii) the complexity of what is in issue,
	- (iii) the severity of the consequences for the defendant and others affected, and
	- (iv) the needs of other cases. 
```

### Duty of Participants

```ad-statute
title: r 1.2 CrimPR - The duty of the participants in a criminal case
(1) Each participant, in the conduct of each case, must―
- (a) prepare and conduct the case in accordance with the overriding objective;
- (b) comply with these Rules, practice directions and directions made by the court; and
- (c) at once inform the court and all parties of any significant failure (whether or not that participant is responsible for that failure) to take any procedural step required by these Rules, any practice direction or any direction of the court. A failure is significant if it might hinder the court in furthering the overriding objective.

(2) Anyone involved in any way with a criminal case is a participant in its conduct for the purposes of this rule.

```

### Case Management Powers

The court must further the overriding objective (r 3.2(1)) by actively managing the case (r 3.2(1)).

```ad-statute
title: r 3.2(2)
Active case management includes―
- (a) the early identification of the real issues;
- (b) the early identification of the needs of witnesses;
- (c) achieving certainty as to what must be done, by whom, and when, in particular by the early setting of a timetable for the progress of the case;
- (d) monitoring the progress of the case and compliance with directions;
- (e) ensuring that evidence, whether disputed or not, is presented in the shortest and clearest way;
- (f) discouraging delay, dealing with as many aspects of the case as possible on the same occasion, and avoiding unnecessary hearings;
- (g) encouraging the participants to co-operate in the progression of the case; and
- (h) making use of technology.
```

Parties must actively assist the court in its duty to manage the case (r 3.3), since failure to do so is inconsistent with the overriding objective ([[R (on the application of DPP) v Chorley [2006] EWHC 1795]]).

- At the beginning of a case, each party must nominate an individual responsible for the progress of the case, and must tell the other parties and the court who that individual is and how he may be contacted (r 3.4(1)).
- The court will nominate a “case progression officer”, ensuring the parties comply and keeping the court informed of anything affecting the case.
- The court is given the power to make any direction or take any step actively to manage a case, unless such a direction or step would contravene legislation (r 3.5).

```ad-statute
title: r 3.8 - Case preparation and progression
(1) At every hearing, if a case cannot be concluded there and then the court must give directions so that it can be concluded at the next hearing or as soon as possible after that.

(2) At every hearing the court must, where relevant―
- (a) if the defendant is absent, decide whether to proceed nonetheless;
- (b) take the defendant’s plea (unless already done) or if no plea can be taken then find out whether the defendant is likely to plead guilty or not guilty;
- (c) set, follow or revise a timetable for the progress of the case, which may include a timetable for any hearing including the trial or (in the Crown Court) the appeal;
- (d) in giving directions, ensure continuity in relation to the court and to the parties’ representatives where that is appropriate and practicable; and
- (e) where a direction has not been complied with, find out why, identify who was responsible, and take appropriate action. 
```

## Professional Conduct

### Rule of Law and Administration of Justice

- All solicitors in criminal proceedings have a duty not to mislead the court (para 1.4 SRA Code)
- This overrides Principle 7 – the duty to act in the client's best interests.

```ad-conduct
If a client tells you they intend to give false evidence at court, the solicitor must tell the client that the solicitor will need to be withdrawn from acting for the client unless the client agrees not to do this. 
```

### Prosecution

Prosecuting advocates are under a duty to ensure that all material evidence supporting the prosecution is put before the court in a fair and dispassionate manner. Prosecution must:

1. Inform the court of any relevant authority, even if the authority favours D
2. Relevant facts known to the prosecutor should be placed before the court, including any facts relevant to mitigation.
3. If the prosecutor obtains evidence assisting D, they must supply particulars of the evidence to the defence; and
4. If a prosecution witness gives evidence inconsistent with any earlier statement by the witness, the prosecuting solicitor should disclose this fact to the defence.

### Defence

#### Instructions From a Third Party

If a friend/ relative contacts the solicitor asking them to attend the police station to advise the person, the solicitor should

- Phone the station and ask to speak to the arrested person, to determine whether they want a lawyer.
- Tell arrested person that they are entitled to free legal advice from a solicitor of their choice.

#### Client Admitting Guilt

The solicitor should advise the client that he would receive credit from the court if he entered an early guilty plea. If the client wishes to plead not guilty and insists on giving evidence from the witness box denying guilt, the solicitor should decline to act (since this would constitute misleading the court).

The solicitor may continue to act on a not guilty plea if D merely intends to put the prosecution to proof. This involves asking prosecution witnesses questions to undermine/ discredit their evidence. But such questioning should not suggest facts to the court which the defence solicitor knows to be false.

If the client admits guilt to their solicitor at the end of a trial, after the client has been acquitted, the solicitor should not take any steps. The solicitor owes a continuing duty of confidentiality to their client, so should not disclose the admission to anyone.

If a solicitor suspects that a defence is fabricated, but the client maintains that it is true, the solicitor will not risk breaching the overriding duty by placing the defence before the court.

If the client wishes to plead not guilty in the face of strong prosecution evidence, advise that they risk losing a reduced sentence, but that it is their choice.

#### Client Pleading Guilty Despite Defence

If a client has a defence available to them, they should be advised to plead not guilty and present the defence. If they insist on pleading guilty, a solicitor may continue to act, but should be advised that they will not then be able to raise a defence.

#### Inconsistent Instructions

If a client gives changing instructions, this is fine. But if instructions are changed with a view to putting forward false evidence to the court, the solicitor should refuse to act.

#### Disclosure of Defence

A solicitor owes a duty of confidentiality to their client. The solicitor should not disclose details of their client's case to any other party without the express consent of the client. Ideally, obtain a client's written consent before disclosing details of their defence.

#### Point of Law

- The defence solicitor has no duty to inform the prosecution of any evidence or witnesses that would prejudice D's case.
- A solicitor's duty is only a negative one: not to mislead the court by allowing evidence to be given by D which the solicitor knows is untrue.
- If a point of law is in dispute, D's solicitor is under a positive duty to assist the court by supplying any relevant authority, even if such authority is harmful to D's case.

#### Client Giving a False Name

If a client gives a false name, address or date of birth to the court, the solicitor should cease to act.

#### Knowledge of Previous Convictions

If the prosecution provide a list of D's previous convictions which is inaccurate/ incomplete and ask D's solicitor to confirm the accuracy of the list, they should decline to comment.

- To confirm the list as accurate would deceive the court
- To disclose previous convictions without client's express consent would be a breach of confidentiality.

#### Conflicts of Interest

A solicitor must not act for two (or more) defendants where there is a conflict of interest between them (SRA Code of Conduct, para 6.2). Most commonly: where two defendants are jointly accused of an offence and each blames the other.

If a conflict arises after the solicitor has begun to act for both D's, the solicitor should normally withdraw from the case entirely. Could only continue to act for one of the Ds if it would not risk breach of the duty of confidentiality they owe to the other. Unlikely to ever be the case in a criminal matter.

#### Interviewing Prosecution Witnesses

There is “no property in a witness”, but D solicitors should proceed with caution if intending to interview a prosecution witness. The usual course of action is to notify the prosecution that the witness is to be interviewed and invite a representative from the CPS to attend as an observer (safeguard against a latter allegation that the witness was pressured to change evidence).

#### Withdrawing From the Case

If a solicitor needs to withdraw from the case, the reason for withdrawal should not normally be given to the client (“for professional reasons” is a common euphemism).

## Legal Professional Privilege

Communications between a client and solicitor are privileged if the purpose is the giving or receiving of legal advice.

- The defence cannot be compelled to reveal the contents of such communications to any other party.
- D cannot be asked about their contents when being cross-examined.

Extends to communications between D and solicitor/ TP, if such communications are made in contemplation of pending/ anticipated proceedings and the dominant purpose was to prepare for the litigation.

## Human Rights

- s 3: interpreting and giving effect to legislation in a way which is compatible with the ECHR, as far as it is possible to do so.
- s 4: declaration of incompatibility
- s 6: it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.
	- Public authority includes a criminal court.
- s 8(1) HRA 1998: in relation to any act or proposed act of a public authority which is considered unlawful, the court may grant such remedy/ relief/ order as it considers just and appropriate.
