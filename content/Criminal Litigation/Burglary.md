# Burglary

## Statute

> [!statute] [s 9 TA 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/9)
> 
> (1) A person is guilty of burglary if—
> - (a) he enters any building or part of a building as a trespasser and with intent to commit any such offence as is mentioned in subsection (2) below; or
> - (b) having entered any building or part of a building as a trespasser he steals or attempts to steal anything in the building or that part of it or inflicts or attempts to inflict on any person therein any grievous bodily harm.
> 
> (2) The offences referred to in subsection (1)(a) above are offences of stealing anything in the building or part of a building in question, of inflicting on any person therein any grievous bodily harm...therein, and of doing unlawful damage to the building or anything therein.
> 
> (3) A person guilty of burglary shall on conviction on indictment be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding-
> - (a) where the offence was committed in respect of a building or part of a building which is a dwelling, fourteen years;
> - (b) in any other case, ten years.
> 
> (4) References in subsections (1) and (2) above to a building, and the reference to subsection (3) above to a building which is a dwelling, shall apply also to an inhabited vehicle or vessel, and shall apply to any such vehicle or vessel at times when the person having a habitation in it is not there as well as at times when he is.

So there are two types of burglary.

### S 9(1)(a) Burglary

For a s 9(1)(a) burglary, the defendant must:

- Enter as a trespasser; and
- Have the intention to commit one of these ulterior offences as they do so:
	- Steal;
	- Inflict grievous bodily harm; or
	- Unlawfully damage property.

The burglary is committed at the point of entry. It does not matter whether or not the defendant goes on to commit the ulterior offence. The key issue is whether the defendant intended to commit the ulterior offence at the point of entry.

### S 9(1)(b) Burglary

In brief, for a s 9(1)(b) burglary, the defendant must:

- Have entered as a trespasser; and
- Once inside:
	- Steal or attempt to steal; or
	- Inflict, or attempt to inflict, grievous bodily harm.

The burglary is committed at the point of attempt or commission of the theft or infliction of grievous bodily harm.

In terms of sentencing, it makes no difference whether the defendant is convicted of a section 9(1)(a) or a s 9(1)(b) burglary. It will be a matter of evidence which of the two the prosecution decides to charge.

## S 9(1)(a) Burglary Elements

| Element    | Burglary                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Actus reus | The defendant enters, a building or part of a building, as a trespasser. |
| Mens rea   | Knowing or being reckless as to entry as a trespasser, at the time of entry D intended any of the offences listed in [s 9(2) TA 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/9): (a) Steal anything in the building or part of the building, (b) inflict grievous bodily harm on any person in the building or part of the building; or (c) damage unlawfully the building or anything therein.                                                                         |

Under the TA 1968, s 9(1)(a), burglary is complete upon entry, provided this is done as a trespasser and accompanied by the intention to commit the ulterior offence.

There is no need for the defendant actually to commit the ulterior offence.

Each of the elements are considered in turn.

### Enters

What amounts to entry has been considered by the courts several times over the years. The old common law rule was that entry was satisfied when any part of a person's body entered a building (or part of a building). In the case of [[R v Ryan [1996] Crim LR 320]] the Court of Appeal laid down the current position.

It is not difficult for a jury to determine as a question of fact when there has been a partial entry sufficient for establishing this element, and it is not likely to raise complexities in practice.

### Building or Part of Building

The TA 1968 only contains a partial definition of this element. According to the [TA 1968, s 9(4)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/9), 'building' for the purposes of the TA 1968, s 9(1) and (2) includes an inhabited vehicle or vessel, whether the person living there is present at the time or not.

Outside this, guidance can be sought from case law. What constitutes 'a building' is a question of fact.

The case of [[Stevens v Gourley [1859] 7 CBNS 99]] held that a building must be 'a structure of considerable size and intended to be permanent or at least endure for a considerable time’.

More authorities:

- [[B and S v Leathley [1979] Crim LR 314]]
- [[Norfolk Constabulary v Seekings and Gould]]
- [[R v Walkington [1979] 2 All ER 716]]

### As a Trespasser

The next part of the _actus reus_ is that the defendant enters, the building or part of a building ‘as a trespasser’. There are two ways in which the defendant can enter as a trespasser:

- Without consent; or
- In excess of authority – at times, the defendant can still be a trespasser even if given consent to enter.

#### No Consent

For this part of the offence, we must borrow from the rules in tort law. Entry into a building or part of a building is a trespass where the building or part entered is in the possession of another, who does not consent to the entry ([[R v Collins [1972] 2 All ER 1105 (CA)]]).

For burglary, it must be proved that a person entered a building (or part) as a trespasser. Where, at the time of entering, a person is not a trespasser, but later becomes one (for example, by exceeding any express or implied limitation on the permission to be on the premises), there can be no conviction for burglary.

#### Entry in Excess of Authority

A person can be a trespasser for the purpose of [s 9(1)(b) TA 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/9) if they enter premises of another knowing that/ being reckless as to whether they are entering in excess of the permission that has been given to them ([[R v Jones and Smith [1976] 3 All ER 54 (CA)]]).

### Enters knowing/ Being Reckless That the Entry Was a Trespass

It need not be proved that the defendant knew in law that they were a trespasser. The defendant merely has to know or be reckless as to the facts which make them a trespasser, for example acting in excess of permission.

### Intending to Commit One of the Ulterior Offences at the Time of Entry

It must be proved that **upon entry** the defendant intended to commit one of the ulterior offences listed in the TA 1968, s 9(2). Therefore, upon entry the defendant must:

- Intend to steal from the building or part of the building; and/or
- Intend to inflict GBH on any person in the building or part of the building; and/or
- Intend unlawfully to damage the building or anything in the building or part of the building.

#### Conditional Intent

What if the intention of the defendant is simply to have a look inside the property and only steal anything they feel is worth stealing? Such a conditional intention has been held to count as an intention in [[AG's References (Nos 1 and 2 of 1979) [1979] 3 All ER 143 (CA)]].

## S 9(1)(b) Burglary Elements

To secure a conviction under the TA 1968, s 9(1)(b), the prosecution must establish:

- The defendant entered
- A building or part of a building
- As a trespasser
- Knowing or being reckless as to entry as a trespasser
- D did one of the following:
	- Stole something from the building or part of the building
	- Attempted to steal something from the building or part of the building
	- Inflicted GBH on any person
	- Attempted to inflict GBH on any person.

It is easier and acceptable to consider this offence by establishing each of the five elements in turn, rather than by breaking the offence down into actus reus and mens rea.

A s 9(1)(b) burglary requires that once inside the building (or part of the building), having entered as a trespasser, the defendant goes on to commit theft or GBH or attempts to commit these offences.

The burglary is committed at the time of the commission or attempted commission of the offence.

### Ulterior Offences

Once inside, the defendant must actually commit one or more of the following offences:

- Theft
	- Appropriation of property belonging to another
	- The full actus reus and mens rea for theft or attempted theft are required.
- Attempted theft
	- An act more than merely preparatory to the commission of a theft
- Infliction of GBH
	- Unlike the TA 1968, s 9(1)(a), the TA 1968, s 9(1)(b) does not specify that the defendant must intend to inflict grievous bodily harm and the term grievous bodily harm describes a level of harm rather than a specific offence.
	- So a number of different crimes may suffice, including:
		- [s 18 Offences Against the Person Act 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/18)
		- [s 20 Offences Against the Person Act 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/20)
	- The case of [[R v Jenkins [1983] 1 All ER 1000]] states that no offence and thus no mens rea at all is required in relation to the infliction of grievous bodily harm.
		- The Court of Appeal said that from the wording of the statute, the infliction of grievous bodily harm need not amount to an offence of any kind and that all was needed was the infliction of this harm.
		- This is _obiter dictum_ and has been the subject of academic criticism. See Smith, Hogan and Ormerod’s, _Criminal Law_ where it is noted that Professor Smith considered there had been a drafting error in not including the word ‘offence’ in the statute.
		- However, it can also be noted that the case strictly follows the words of the statute. _R v Jenkins_ went to the House of Lords on another issue, where no allusion to or criticism was made of what the Court of Appeal had said on this issue. It is therefore the current law.
- Attempted infliction of GBH.
	- An act more than merely preparatory to a s 18 or s 20 OAPA offence (what about s 47?).

Note that if the relevant offence is theft or attempted theft, the relevant _mens rea_ is still required (dishonest intention to permanently deprive).

> [!warning]
> Although criminal damage is stated as a relevant offence in s 9(2) for the purposes of a s 9(1)(a) offence, it is not included in a s 9(1)(b) offence.

## Omerod

Burglary is qualitatively different from a mere attempt to commit theft or damage or cause injury. It encompasses 6 separate offences under s 9(1)(a) and 4 under s 9(1)(b), which has led to calls for reformulation.

### Entry

At common law if D inserted an instrument into the building for the purpose of committing the ulterior offence, there was an entry even though no part of the body was introduced into the building But these lead to some strange consequences, so it is unclear whether such a rule would be followed under the 1968 Act.

### As a Trespasser

In [[R v Jones and Smith [1976] 3 All ER 54 (CA)]], the occupier's son had a general permission to enter his father's house. He entered the house with E for the purpose of stealing. This constituted burglary. D had knowingly exceeded the permission granted to hi by his father. Here D and E took elaborate precautions, going at the dead of night.

Where D gains entry by deception, he enters as a trespasser (e.g., pretending he has been sent by the utility company).

A person with limited authority to enter for a particular purpose enters as a trespasser, though he practises no deception, if he has an unlawful purpose outside the scope of that limited authority. In [[Taylor v Jackson]], D had express permission to go on V's land and hunt for rabbits, but instead hunted for hares. This was held to be evidence of trespass. Similarly, in [[Hillen and Pettigrew v ICI (Alkali) Ltd]], members of a stevedore's gang who had permission to enter a barge for the limited purpose of unloading it were held to be trespassers when they placed kegs on the hatch covers, knowing that this was a wrong and dangerous thing to do. Lord Atkin:

> As Scrutton LJ has pointedly said: 'When you invite a person into your house to use the staircase, you do not invite him to slide down the banisters'. So far as he sets foot on so much of the premises as lie outside the invitation or uses them for purposes which are alien to the invitation, he is not an invitee but a trespasser'.

That's Lord Scrutton in The Carlgarth [1927].

The late Professor Sir John Smith argued that this would mean that a person who enters a shop with the intention of stealing would be guilty of burglary, as he only has permission to enter for the purpose of shopping. However, it would be difficult in most cases to prove that the intention to shoplift was there at the point of entering the shop.

### Building

All dwellings are included, regardless of their material of construction. To contitute a building, the structure must have some degree of permanence. The word building is given its natural meaning. According to Lord Esher MR, its 'ordinary and usual meaning is, a block of brick or stone work, covered in by a roof'.

What constitutes part of a building may be a difficult and important question. Its main significance is that a person may lawfully enter one part of the building, yet be a trespasser on setting foot in another. For the purposes of burglary, it seems buildings fall into two parts: those arts where D is entitled to be, and those where he is not.

### Ulterior Offence

It must be proved that at the time of entry, D intended to cause the harm in question. In many such cases, D's intent may be conditional at the time of entry. If D intends to steal a specific item only (should it be present), it seems that the s 9(1)(a) offence is not committed.
