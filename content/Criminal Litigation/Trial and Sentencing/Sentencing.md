# Sentencing

```toc
```

## Legislation

- **Sentencing Act 2020**.
- This created the **Sentencing Code**.
- Technical amendments made by **Sentencing (Pre-consolidation Amendments) Act 2020**
- All of the above just consolidated existing law
- The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 will make changes to sentencing.

## Purpose

```ad-statute
title: s 57 SC - purposes of sentencing: adults

(1) This section applies where—
- (a) a court is dealing with an offender for an offence, and
- (b) the offender is aged 18 or over.

(2) The court must have regard to the following purposes of sentencing—
- (a) the **punishment** of offenders,
- (b) the **reduction of crime** (including its reduction by deterrence),
- (c) the **reform and rehabilitation** of offenders,
- (d) the **protection** of the public, and
- (e) the making of **reparation** by offenders to persons affected by their offences.

(3) Subsection (1) does not apply—
- (a) to an offence in relation to which a mandatory sentence requirement applies (see section 399)
```

The court's decision must be open:

```ad-statute
title: s 52 SC 2020
(2) The court must state **in open court, in ordinary language** and in general terms, the court's reasons for deciding on the sentence.

(3) The court must **explain to the offender** in ordinary language—
- (a) the effect of the sentence,
- (b) the effects of non-compliance with any order that the offender is required to comply with and that forms part of the sentence,
- (c) any power of the court to vary or review any order that forms part of the sentence, and
- (d) the effects of failure to pay a fine, if the sentence consists of or includes a fine.
```

## Types of Sentence

- Custodial sentence
- Community sentence
- Fine
- Discharge

These are referred to as the “sentencing ladder”.

![[sentencing-ladder.png]]

```ad-statute
title: s 204 SC 2020 - Exercise of power to impose community order: general considerations

(1) This section applies where a community order is available.

(2) The court must not make a community order unless it is of the opinion that—
- (a) the offence, or
- (b) the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it,

was serious enough to warrant the making of such an order.

(3) In forming its opinion for the purposes of subsection (2), the court must take into account all the information that is available to it about the circumstances of the offence, or of it and the associated offence or offences, including any aggravating or mitigating factors.

(4) The pre-sentence report requirements (see section 30) apply to the court in relation to forming that opinion.

(5) The fact that, by virtue of subsection (2), the court may make a community order does not require it to do so.
```

```ad-statute
title: s 230 SC 2020 - Threshold for imposing discretionary custodial sentence
(1) Subsection (2) applies where a person is convicted of an offence which is punishable with a custodial sentence.

This is subject to subsection (3).

(2) The court must not pass a custodial sentence unless it is of the opinion that—
- (a) the offence, or
- (b) the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it,

was so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified for the offence.

*Threshold generally not applicable where mandatory sentence requirement applies*.
```

### Ancillary Orders

The court may impose ancillary orders on D, including

1. Compensation
	- D may be ordered to pay compensation to the victim of an offence for any injury/ loss suffered (ss 133-146 SC 2020)
	- Section 63A LASPO 2012 requires the court to consider making a compensation order.
	- [[Magistrates' Court]]: maximum compensation of £5,000 per offence
	- [[Crown Court]]: no financial limit.
2. Prosecution costs
3. Victim surcharge
4. Defence costs
	- D with representation order in [[Crown Court]] not required to contribute towards costs of case.
	- Crown Court means testing: D with a representation order in [[Crown Court]] may be required to contribute.
5. Forfeiture orders
	- If property was used for committing/ facilitating offence, intended for use in offence, or unlawfully in possession (s 153 SC 2020)
	- Normally coupled with a destruction order.
6. Confiscation and restitution orders
	- e.g., confiscating drug-dealing profits.
7. Criminal behaviour orders
	- s 331 SC 2020: [[Magistrates' Court]] may make a CBO if:
		- D has engaged in behaviour which caused/ is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to any person
		- the court considers that making the order will help in preventing D.
8. Binding over
	- Must be a breach of the peace involving violence/ imminent threat of violence/ real risk of violence.
	- Court requires D to enter into a “recognisance” - money forfeited if terms of the order are broken.
9. Sex offenders
	- Sexual Offences Act 2003: D can be added to sex offenders register by the police if convicted of a specified offence.
	- Court may make a sexual offences prevention order
		- Prevents D contacting victims, having close contact with children etc.
10. Serious crime prevention orders
	- s 1 Serious Crime Act 2007: order made if there are reasonable grounds to believe the order would protect the public by preventing D taking part in serious crime.
	- Usually restricts D's financial/ business dealings/ communicating with associates/ international travel.

## Sentencing Principles

CJA 2003 radically changed sentencing.

- Created the Sentencing Guidelines Council, now replaced with the **Sentencing Council for England and Wales**
	- 14 members
	- Prepare sentencing guidelines in relation to any sentencing matter
	- Must have regard to current practice, need for consistency, impact on victims, need to promote public confidence in the criminal justice system etc.
- Every court has a duty to follow relevant guidelines unless satisfied that it would be contrary to the **interests of justice** to do so.

### Seriousness

```ad-statute
title: s 63 - Assessing seriousness

Where a court is considering the seriousness of any offence, it must consider—
- (a) the offender's culpability in committing the offence, and
- (b) any harm which the offence—
	- (i) caused,
	- (ii) was intended to cause, or
	- (iii) might foreseeably have caused. 
```

General Guideline for sentencing offences not covered by a specific sentencing guideline, effective from 01/10/19.

### General Guideline

See the steps below

#### 1: Provisional Sentence

Court should take into account:

- Statutory maximum/ minimum sentence
- Sentencing judgments of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)
- Definitive sentencing guidelines for analogous offences.

Seriousness assessed considering the culpability of the offender and the harm caused.

Consider the 5 purposes of sentencing.

#### 2: Aggravating and Mitigating Factors

Identify whether the overall adjustment is up or down. For the court to determine how much weight to assign to each of the factors.

If FPN was available, the reason why the offender did not take advantage of the fixed penalty is a relevant consideration.

Consider both statutory and other aggravating factors, then factors reducing seriousness and personal mitigation.

#### 3: Reduction for Assisting Prosecution?

Any discounted sentence in consequence of assistance given/ offered to the prosecutor (N.B. rare – there is no formal system of plea bargaining in the UK).

#### 4: Reduction for Guilty Pleas

```ad-statute
title: s 73 SC 2020

(1) This section applies where a court is determining what sentence to pass on an offender who has pleaded guilty to an offence in proceedings before that or another court.

(2) The court must take into account the following matters—
- (a) the **stage in the proceedings** for the offence at which the offender indicated the intention to plead guilty, and
- (b) the **circumstances** in which the indication was given.
```

The Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea Definitive Guideline applies to all adult Ds and to both the [[Magistrates' Court]] and [[Crown Court]].

$\frac{1}{3}$ discount on sentence available:

- on a guilty plea in the magistrates’ court;
- on a guilty plea and committal for sentence;
- on indication of a guilty plea to an indictable-only offence, followed by a guilty plea at first hearing in the Crown Court.

```ad-defn
title: Committal
A committal for sentence happens when magistrates have found someone guilty of a crime but they think their sentencing powers are not enough. The magistrates transfer the case to the Crown Court where a higher sentence can be imposed.
```

$\frac{1}{4}$ discount available at the plea and trial preparation hearing stage (PTPH).

The guideline focuses on when a guilty plea is indicated, not when entered. “First part of proceedings” means when D is first asked when he intends to plead guilty at the [[Magistrates' Court]] ([[R v Hodgin [2020] EWCA Crim 1388]]).

Any indication of a guilty plea must be **unequivocal**.

Other factors (e.g., assisting police) should be taken into account as separate mitigating factors, not formally as the credit given for a guilty plea.

#### 5: Dangerousness

If the offence is listed in Sch 15 and/or Sch 15B CJA 2003, the court should consider whether it would be appropriate to impose a life sentence or extended sentence.

#### 6: Offenders of Concern

Add a year in some cases.

#### 7: Totality Principle

If D sentenced for $>1$ offence/ already serving a sentence, consider whether the total sentence is just and proportionate to the overall offending behaviour.

D sentenced for a particular offence may ask the court to take other offences into consideration (TIC) when considering the sentence to be imposed.

- Often the additional offences will add nothing/ v little to the sentence
- D wipes the slate clean and cannot subsequently be prosecuted for the other offences.
- Police improve clear-up rates.

Generally, a court should not impose both a fine and a custodial sentence. But this is OK if the sentence is a suspended custodial sentence ([[R v Channer [2021] EWCA Crim 696]]).

#### 8: Consider Whether to Make compensation/ Ancillary Orders

See above.

#### 9: Reasons

Give reasons and explain the effect of the sentence.

#### 10. Consideration for Time on Bail

s 240A CJA 2003 – used to be the case that tagged bail could count towards time served.

## Pre-sentence Reports

### From Probation Service

s 31(1) SC 2020: pre-sentence report from probation service prepared with a view to assisting the court in determining the most suitable method of dealing with an offender.

Standard format of report. Report includes:

- Character references
	- If D is of good character, can someone in a position of respect in the community provide a character reference?
- Medical reports

```ad-action
Solicitor should discuss report with D and ensure accuracy.
```

## Sentencing Procedure

### Magistrates' Court

![[sentencing-procedure.png]]

- D enters guilty plea or is convicted following trial
- Court supplied with details of any offences D wishes to have taken into consideration.
- Prosecuting solicitor supplies the court with a list of D's previous convictions.
- Prosecuting solicitor ask for any ancillary orders.
- D's solicitor addresses magistrates. May ask for adjournment (to get reports)
- If case not adjourned,
	- D's solicitor gives a plea in mitigation. May call character witnesses
	- Magistrates sentence D
- If case adjourned
	- Usually adjourned for 3-4 weeks.
	- D released in bail/ remanded in custody
	- Presumption of granting bail.
	- When the case comes back, likely to be dealt with by a different bench of magistrates.
	- Plea in mitigation and sentencing.

### Crown Court

Pretty much the same as above

Usually if a judge adjourns a case for preparation of reports, they will reserve the case to themselves to ensure they sentence D.

Again there is a presumption of bail.

```ad-important
D must be told the reasons for and effect of the sentence imposed (s 52(1) SC 2020)
```

## Conduct

D's solicitor should never be asked by the court to confirm the accuracy of the list of D's previous convictions.

- Duty not to deceive the court
- Duty of confidentiality.

Good practice is to obtain details of previous convictions from the CPS in advance of the sentencing hearing.

If client insists on pretending the list is accurate, solicitor must cease to act.

## Plea in Mitigation

*Considered in relation to [[Magistrates' Court]]*.

Structured in 4 parts:

1. The likely sentence
	- Identify what the starting point sentence is likely to be.
	- Objective: to persuade magistrates to impose a lower sentence.
2. The offence
	- Talk down aggravating factors and talk up mitigating factors.
3. The offender (sob story)
	- D's age
		- Young/ old = sympathy
	- D's health
		- Unwise to suggest that offence was committed under drugs/ alcohol in sentencing, since this is usually an aggravating factor
		- But if D is an addict/ alcoholic, can suggest a sentence designed to help D overcome the addiction (rehabilitation requirement).
		- Long-term illness = sympathy.
	- Cooperation with police/ early guilty plea
		- Remind the court of guilty plea.
		- Prompt confession is useful mitigation.
	- Voluntary compensation
		- Voluntary compensation to victim looked on favourably, especially if D is poor.
	- Remorse
		- Evidence of true remorse is mitigation.
		- e.g., D starts to attend Alcoholics Anonymous classes after a drunken incident.
	- Character
		- Previous convictions may be viewed as aggravating (s 65 SC 2020), if recent/ similar type of offence.
		- Attempt to distinguish the previous convictions.
		- No previous convictions taken into account positively.
	- Family circumstances
		- If there is a pregnant partner/ child with disability, the court may be swayed.
		- Tell the court if D will lose his job upon a custodial sentence
		- Talk about troubled family background.
	- Consequences of conviction
		- Other adverse consequences suffered by D (loss of job/ reputation)
	- Low risk of reoffending
4. The suggested sentence.
	- Should be lower than likely sentence but realistic.
