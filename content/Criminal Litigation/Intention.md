# Intention

There are two types of intention in criminal law:

1. direct intent; and
2. oblique intent (also known as indirect intent).

## Direct Intention

Direct intent is where the consequence is what the defendant aims to happen. It is the purpose or objective of D’s act. If the consequence is D’s purpose, D intends it even if D’s chances of success are slim. This is a wholly subjective test, from the defendant’s point of view.

For example, if the defendant, wanting to kill, shoots at his victim half a mile away knowing that D could easily miss, D still intends to kill because that is what D is trying to achieve. The result has formed at least part of the reason for D acting.

### General Rule

In [[R v Moloney [1985] 1 All ER 1025 (HL)]] Lord Bridge made it clear that it was the jury's task to decide on the matter of intention. He stated that the word should be given its ordinary meaning and that judges should generally avoid defining the term intention, beyond explaining that it differs from 'desire' and 'motive’.

> 'The golden rule should be that, when directing a jury on the mental element necessary in a crime of specific intent, the judge should avoid any elaboration or paraphrase of what it meant by intent, and leave it to the jury's good sense to decide whether the accused acted with the necessary intent, unless the judge is convinced that, on the facts and having regard to the way the case has been presented to the jury in evidence and argument, some further elaboration is strictly necessary to avoid misunderstanding.’

It should also be noted that their Lordships made it clear within that this approach of determining the defendant's direct intent was not restricted to murder cases and was to be of general application.

## Oblique Intention

Very occasionally cases arise where there is a need to elaborate upon the meaning of intention because:

- The jury has specifically requested further guidance on the issue, in which case further direction should be given to them.
- The trial judge is of the opinion that the facts themselves, or the presentation of evidence in court, has meant that the jury would benefit from further guidance.

It has been suggested by Lord Bridge in Moloney that such cases would be 'rare'. However, he did not make any attempt to clarify what sort of cases would fall into this 'rare' category.

By way of example, it has since been suggested that it may sometimes be necessary to give a jury an elaborated direction on the meaning of intention in those relatively rare cases where the defendant does an act which is manifestly dangerous, and as a result someone dies, but where the primary desire or motive may not have been to harm that person.

It is murder trials that have provided the forum for discussion of this issue in the past, although there is no reason why this could not become an issue in any offence where intention is the only form of mens rea available. In reality, the number of cases where extended guidance is given to a jury is extremely small.

> Oblique intent is where the consequence is not the defendant's purpose but rather a side effect that D accepts as an inevitable or certain accompaniment to D’s direct intention. The consequence here does not have to be 'desired'. Indeed, the defendant may even regret that this incidental consequence will occur.

### Test

The test for oblique intent was adopted by the House of Lords in [[R v Woollin [1999] AC 82]]. The current model direction to be given to the jury was said to be as follows:

> 'Where the charge is murder and in the rare cases where the simple direction is not enough, the jury should be directed that they are not entitled to find the necessary intention unless they feel sure that the death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen event) as a result of the defendant's action and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case. The decision is one for the jury to be reached upon consideration of all the evidence.'  
> (Per Lord Steyn.)

### Evidence of Intention

There is some debate about whether oblique intention is a definition of intention or merely evidence of intention. Case law suggests that oblique intention is evidence of intention:

- In [[R v Moloney [1985] 1 All ER 1025 (HL)]], Lord Bridge stated that such a state of mind could only be evidence of intention.
- In [[R v Woollin [1999] AC 82]], the jury are still to be instructed that they are not entitled to find the necessary intention unless they find foresight of virtual certainty, not that they must find the necessary intention in such a case.

[[R v Matthews and Alleyne [2003] EWCA Crim 192]]

### Defining Intention

The proposition that foresight of virtual certainty could be evidence of intention without also being intention has been much criticised by academics. See Professor John Smith [1998] Crim LR 891:

> ‘…some of us hoped that a perceptive jury would ask some unlucky judge what was the state of mind they were required to find proved which was not purpose but was something more than foresight of virtual certainty? – a question to which there appears to be no answer.' Professor John Smith, Crim LR 1998 at 891.

The Draft Criminal Code also includes oblique intention in its definition of intention:

> ‘(1) … a person acts  
> (a) "intentionally" with respect to a result when –  
> (i) it is his purpose to cause it, or  
> (ii) although it is not his purpose to cause it, he knows that it would occur in the ordinary course of events if he were to succeed in his purpose of causing some other result.'

### Summary

If a defendant's purpose in acting is not to produce the _actus reus_ of the crime with which D has been charged and intention is the only type of _mens rea_ available, D may still be found to have an intention to commit that _actus reus_ if D has oblique intent.

Much of the law in this area has concentrated on what is required for the jury to find indirect intent but **_R v Woollin_** contains the current model direct to be given to the jury.

Oblique intent is only to be used in **rare** circumstances when the facts require it and when intention is the **only** form of _mens rea_ for the offence e.g. murder, causing GBH with intent contrary to **s18, Offences Against the Person Act 1861.**

This means that if the rules of the offence allows _mens rea_ in the form of intention **or** recklessness, then you must not refer to oblique intent. For example, if a defendant is charged with criminal damage and D does not directly intend to destroy/damage property, then you must consider whether D was reckless.

## Motive and Intention

Intention should not be confused with motive or desire.

While the defendant may have a motive (for instance, a reason to kill), that does not mean when D commits the _actus reus_ D can automatically be taken to have the intention to kill.

However, while a motive is not the same as intention, an individual can be taken to intend both their ends and the means through which they will achieve them.

In [[R v Moloney [1985] 1 All ER 1025 (HL)]], the judgment of Lord Bridge gave the following example: Suppose D puts a bomb in a cargo aeroplane which he has insured and the bomb is timed to go off mid-flight. It is D’s aim/direct intention to claim for the aircraft on his insurance. This is his motive in placing the bomb in the aeroplane. However, the destruction of the aeroplane is the means to achieving his aim, so destroying the aeroplane is also his direct intention. The death of the pilot, is an inevitable side effect of what he has done, but was not necessary for him to achieve his aim, so this is his oblique intention.

[[Chandler v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 763]]

Where the jury were satisfied that the appellant's immediate purpose was proven, they were right to find the appellants guilty, regardless of whether they thought the long-term purpose in itself beneficial. Their motive behind the immediate action was irrelevant, they still intended the method of achieving it.

### Evidence of Intention

Motive can be used as evidence of intention ([[R v Hill (1985) 81 Cr App R 206 (CA)]]).

Robert Goff LJ stated in the context of poisoning offences under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 24.

> 'We have no doubt that, in considering whether in any particular case the accused acted “with intent to injure”, it is necessary to have regard not merely to his intent with regard to the effect which the noxious thing will have upon the person to whom it is administered, but to his whole object in acting as he has done. The accused may, in one case, administer the noxious thing with the intent that it would itself injure the person in question; but in another case he may have an ulterior motive, as for example when he administers a sleeping pill to a woman with an intent to rape her when she is comatose. In either case he will, in our judgment, have an intent to injure the person in question, within the words in the section.’

For murder:

1. A result is intended when it is the actor's purpose to call it
2. A court or jury ay also find that a result is intended, though it is not the actor's purpose to cause it, when
	1. the result is a virtually certain consequence of his act, and
	2. the actor knows that it is a virtually certain consequence.
