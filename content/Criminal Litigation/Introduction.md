## Suspect at Police Station

The police have investigative powers:

- Arrest and questioning
- Decisions after charge
- The role of the defence legal adviser at the police station
- Professional ethics.

## Ethics

| Principle | Rule                                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Uphold rule of law                      |
| 2         | Maintain public trust in the profession |
| 4         | Act with honesty                        |
| 5         | Act with integrity                      |
| 7         | Client's best interest                                        |

| Standard | Rule                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| r 1.4    | Duty not to mislead the court        |
| r 2      | Duty to the court                    |
| r 6.2    | Conflict of interest between clients |
| r 6.3    | Duty of confidentiality              |
| r 6.4    | Duty of disclosure                                     |

Even if your client did it, and you think they did it, you can still plead not guilty and put the prosecution to proof. But can't allow client to put forward a positive defence which you know is not true.

Generally, common to represent more than one client involved in the same matter, with no conflict of interest if they are all given generally consistent advice. If they are, e.g., blaming each other, then there is a conflict of interest. You are not able to act for either client in this case! Because you have a duty of confidentiality to both clients (6.3) but a duty of disclosure (6.4).

## Going to Court

- Usually on advice on CPS
	- Evidence test
	- Public interest test
- More serious offences
- Bail with or without conditions, or kept in police custody before next available court date.

Requisition:

## Venue

Depends on the category of offence:

- Summary only offences
- Offences triable only on indictment
- Either way offences.

### Summary Only

- Initial details of prosecution case (IDPC)
- Enter plea at first hearing.
	- If plead guilty, magistrate/ DJ will go on to sentence D, or adjourn the case for a pre-sentence report (either for a few hours or 3-4 weeks).
	- Vast majority of cases are pleaded guilty.
- Plead not guilty
	- Trial adjourned to a trial date
	- Acquittal or conviction
- Sentencing
	- Court may first adjourn for PSR

### Offence Triable Only on Indictment

- First appearance: is the offence an indictable only one?
- If yes, sent to the Crown Court (under s 51 Crime and Disorder Act 1998). Note that no pleas indicated.

### Either Way Offence

Initial details of prosecution case  
Plea before venue

- Guilty plea
	- Sentence or adjourn for PSR
	- If too serious: commit to Crown Court for sentence
- Not guilty plea
	- Allocation hearing
	- if the court declines jurisdiction, the case is sent to the Crown Court
	- If the court accepts jurisdiction, D has a choice of trial venue.
		- Unfettered decision.

## Adjournment and Bail

- Will D be released on bail or remanded in custody?
- A decision for the court, but speak to the prosecution
	- Can you negotiate conditional bail?
	- Find out grounds/ factors for objecting to bail
- Procedure
	- Prosecutor sets out objections
	- Defence make application
		- Best to respond to each objection in turn
		- Suggest realistic package of conditions
		- Call surety if applicable
	- Court makes decision.

## Criminal Case Analysis

- What must the prosecution prove?
	- Evidential and legal burden
		- Is there a case to answer?
		- Is the magistrate/ DJ sure of guilt?
	- What is the offence? Identify law
	- Ask: who, what, when, where, how
- How can the prosecution prove the offence?
	- Evidence
		- Witness statements
		- Interview record/ significant statements/ silence
		- Bad character evidence
		- Forensic evidence
		- Real evidence
		- CCTV evidence.
- Analysing the defence
	- What is the defence?
		- Specific defence?
		- Evidential burden only or a legal burden (e.g., diminished responsibility. Note this would be to the civil standard)
		- What evidence will D be adducing, including whether D will testify?

## Rules of Evidence in Criminal Proceedings

- Only relevant evidence is admissible
- Hearsay evidence only admissible if it comes within an exception
- Exceptions include:
	- Business documents

### Hearsay

- Out of court statement
- Admissible if relevant to a fact in issue
- Hearsay
	- If maker's purpose it to make another believe that it is true
	- Being admitted to prove truth of matter stated
- Hearsay evidence so only admissible if it comes within s 114(1).

The main hearsay exceptions pertain to documentary hearsay.

- s 116 CJA 2003:
	- Is the witness unable to attend the trial?
	- If so, why?
	- Is the information first-hand hearsay?
	- Is it evidence the witness could give to the court?
- s 117 CJA 2003: business documents
	- Who created the document?
	- Who supplied the information?
	- If there is any intermediary, did each person through whom the information was supplied act in the course of a trade/ business/ profession?

### Confession Evidence

- Defined in s 82(1) Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
	- Includes any statement wholly or partly adverse to the person who made it, whether made to a person in authority or not and whether in words or otherwise.
	- s 76(1) PCA: confessions are admissible as an exception to eh hearsay rule, but
		- D can challenge admissibility by relying on s 76(2) PACE or s 78 PACE.

### Evidence of D's Bad Character

- s 98 CJA 2003: evidence of, or a disposition towards misconduct.
- Misconduct: “The commission of an offence or other reprehensible behaviour” (s 112 CJA 2003)

- There are 7 gateways in total.
- Procedure: Part 21 CrPR
- Challenges to admissibility
	- Has the gateway been opened?
	- s 103(3) – definition of propensity under s 103(2) will not apply if the court is satisfied by reason of the length of time since the conviction or for any other reason, that it would be unjust for it to apply in his case.
	- s 101(3) – mandatory exclusion where it appears to the court that it would have such an adverse effect on the fairness that the court ought not admit it.
- [[R v Hanson, Gilmore & Pickstone [2005] Crim LR 787]]
	- Detailed guidelines on the operation of gateway D

### Law of Sentencing
