# Theft

## Appropriating Property

```ad-defn
title: Theft
A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and “thief” and “steal” shall be construed accordingly.
```

All five elements must be proved to secure a conviction for theft:

| Element    | Theft                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Actus reus | Appropriation ([s 3 Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/3)), property ([s 4 Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/4)), belonging to another ([s 5 Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/5)) |
| Mens rea   | Dishonestly ([s 2 Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/2), with intention to permanently deprive ([s 6 Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/6)))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Coincidence

All of the elements must exist simultaneously. This can cause problems when dealing with factual scenarios.

```ad-example
Martha borrows her friend's dress for a night out, intending to give it back the following day. However, Martha then changes her mind and keeps the dress. 

What if Edward's grandmother gave him some money to put towards a deposit for a house but Edward uses the money to go on holiday? Has he stolen this money?

The Theft Act 1968 caters for such scenarios and both instances could still amount to theft.
```

## Appropriation

```ad-defn
title: Appropriation

'Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner.’
[s 3(1) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/contents)
```

Two important principles emerged from [[R v Morris [1983] 3 All ER 288]]:

1. The assumption of any one of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, for example selling it, hiring it, giving it away or destroying it.
2. Even if D does not intend by the act of appropriation itself to deprive the owner permanently of the property, D may be guilty of theft.

### Consent

The natural meaning of 'appropriation' might suggest an act which is not consented to by the owner of the property. In [[R v Gomez [1993] 1 All ER 1 (HL)]] the majority in the House of Lords decided that a defendant can appropriate property even with the consent of the owner.

### Theft of Gifts

A gift can be appropriation if the gift was received in dishonest circumstances: [[R v Hinks [2000] 4 All ER 833]].

### A Later Appropriation

All the elements of theft must exist simultaneously.

There are likely to be occasions when the defendant does not have the *mens rea* when first assuming an owner's right, and therefore does not commit theft at this point.

In such circumstances, when the defendant does form the necessary *mens rea* later it will then be necessary to apply the [Theft Act 1968, s 3(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/3):

> 'Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner.'

This section can be applied when the initial assumption of the rights of the owner does not amount to theft. It provides that a later assumption of a right, either by keeping it or by dealing with it, will be an appropriation. The theft will therefore take place when the defendant forms the *mens rea*, subject to the remaining elements also being present.

### The Innocent Purchaser

The [Theft Act 1968, s 3(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/3) exempts a defendant from liability for theft where the defendant purchases goods in good faith and for value, then later discovers that the seller had no title to the property, but decides to keep it ([[R v Adams [1993] Crim LR 72]]).

Note that *mala fides* (bad faith) precludes the protection afforded by the Theft Act 1968, s 3(2).

## Property

[s 4(1) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/4) states:

> ‘Property’ includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property'.

Generally, all property may be stolen, although there are certain exceptions in relation to land (s 4(2)), things growing wild (s 4(3)), and wild creatures (s 4(4)).

N.B. real property means land (subject to the three exceptions below, and personal property means "stuff" - a car, a book etc.)

```ad-statute
title: [s 4(2) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/4)

(2) A person cannot steal land, or things forming part of land and severed from it by him or by his directions, except in the following cases, that is to say-

(a) when he is a trustee or personal representative, or is authorised by power of attorney, or as liquidator of a company, or otherwise, to sell or dispose of land belonging to another, and he appropriates the land or anything forming part of it by dealing with it in breach of the confidence reposed in him; or

(b) when he is not in possession of the land and appropriates anything forming part of the land by severing it or causing it to be severed, or after it has been severed; or

(c) when, being in possession of the land under a tenancy, he appropriates the whole or part of any fixture or structure let to be used with the land.’
```

In general, land cannot be stolen. However, a person can be guilty of theft if, for example:

- s 4(2)(a) – D is authorised to sell land and sells more than they are meant to;
- s 4(2)(b) – D is a trespasser or invited guest and removes a fence or a lavender plant;
- s 4(2)(c) – D is a tenant and removes or sells without removing, a fixed greenhouse.

### Exception: Wild Plants

D will not be guilty of theft if they pick any of the following from plants growing in the wild:

- Mushrooms;
- Flowers;
- Fruit; and/ or
- Foliage.

D can however be guilty of theft if the purpose of picking from the wild plant is:

- A reward;
- To sell; or
- For another commercial purpose.
- D uproots or cuts parts of the wild plant.
- D picks cultivated plants.

```ad-statute
title: [Theft Act 1968, s 4(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/4)

‘A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who picks flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose.

For the purposes of this subsection “mushroom” includes any fungus, and “plant” includes any shrub or tree.’
```

```ad-example
Karen picks blackberries from the side of the road, makes them into jam and sells the jam in aid of charity. 

The blackberries are capable of being stolen. The blackberries are growing wild, but she has picked them for sale, so they are capable of being stolen, see s 4(3) Theft Act 1968. They would belong to the owner of the land, possibly the highways authority - all land is owned by somebody. She may not be liable for theft however as she may not be dishonest.
```

### Exception: Wild Animals

D will not be guilty of the theft of:

- Untamed animals; and/ or
- Animals not ordinarily kept in captivity.

D can be guilty of theft of:

- Tamed animals (for example, pets such as a cat or dog);
- Animals kept in captivity (for example, in a zoo); and/ or
- Animals in the course of being reduced into possession (for example, have been trapped).

```ad-statute
title: [Theft Act 1968, s 4(4)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/4)

‘Wild creatures, tamed or untamed, shall be regarded as property; but a person cannot steal a wild creature not tamed nor ordinarily kept in captivity, or the carcase of any such creature, unless either it has been reduced into possession by or on behalf of another person and possession of it has not since been lost or abandoned, or another person is in course of reducing it into possession.’
```

#### Property Which Can Be Stolen

Money – notes, coins including other currencies

- Real property – land in certain circumstances discussed already
- Personal property, for example a coat, a ring, a car, water, gas
- Intangible property such as things in action (a right to sue/ recover)- company shares, trademarks, patents, copyright, a debt, a credit in a bank account, forged cheques, cheques drawn on accounts in credit or those drawn on accounts within the agreed overdraft limit (as the bank is obligated to honour the cheque)
- Unlawful or illegal items such as Class A drugs ([[Smith, Plummer and Haines [2011] EWCA Crim 66]])

### Property Which Cannot Be Stolen

- Wild plants and animals – except certain circumstances discussed already
- Electricity ([[Low v Blease [1975] Crim LR 513]])
- Corpses and body parts except those which have been taken into another’s possession or control such as:
	- Corpses in hospitals
	- Blood given to a blood bank
	- Corpses or body parts which have ‘acquired different attributes’ for scientific or teaching purposes ([[R v Kelly and Lindsay [1999] QB 621]])
- Confidential information does not fall within the definition of intangible property ([[Oxford v Moss (1978) 68 Cr App R 183]])
- Services such as a train journey
- Cheques drawn on accounts over the agreed overdraft limit (as the bank is not obligated to honour the cheque)

## Belonging to Another

```ad-statute
title: [Theft Act 1968, s 5(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/5)
Property shall be regarded as belonging to any person having possession or control of it, or having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest).
```

This is a wide definition, which extends beyond ownership to include those having possession or control of it or a proprietary interest in it at the moment of appropriation.

Again, there is considerable case law and additional statutory provisions that deal with the issue of when property will be deemed to belong to another.

### Abandoned Property

Property can cease to belong to another if it has been abandoned. However, the courts do not readily find that property has been abandoned.

In [[Williams v Phillips (1957) 41 Cr App R 5]] it was held that householders do not abandon goods that are put in their domestic waste. The householder intends the goods to be collected by the local authority, so a refuse collector could be guilty of theft if appropriating goods from a bin with the relevant *mens rea*.

Property is not abandoned just because the owner has stopped looking for it.

```ad-example
A husband who has lost his wedding ring and has long since given up looking for it, will not have abandoned it.
```

In [[Hibbert v McKiernan [1948] 1 All ER 860]] it was held that lost golf balls had not been abandoned by their owners. However, this does not mean that property cannot be abandoned. It will depend on whether the owner wants the property or wants it to go to another party, or whether the owner does not mind what happens to it.

### Possession or Control

The [Theft Act 1968, s 5(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/5) states that property belongs to those having possession or control of it. The courts have found that property can belong to persons who have possession or control, not just of the specified property, but over the land upon which it was found. This can be so even if the owner of the land is unaware of its existence:

- Steps to exclude trespassers from a property is considered control of the property and its contents ([[R v Woodman [1974] 2 All ER 955]]).
- The occupier of a building has rights superior to those of a finder of chattels in it, provided he has manifested an intention to exercise control over things which may be there ([[Parker v British Airways Board [1982] 1 All ER 834]]).

### Stealing Own Property

It is possible to steal one's own property, provided that the property is under the possession and control of another at the relevant time [[R v Turner (No 2) [1971] 1 WLR 901]].

### Property Given to Another for a Particular Purpose

Sometimes defendants will not form the necessary *mens rea* until after their initial appropriation of the property. Section 5(3) sets out the rules for when title of the property has passed to the defendant by the time D has formed the dishonest intent.

The general civil rule is that title to property passes at the time that the parties intend it to pass. s 5(3) can be used to cover cases where property is handed over for a particular purpose, and the title in that property passes to the accused before D has formed a dishonest intention to use it for an unauthorised purpose.

```ad-statute
title: [Theft Act 1968, s 5(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/5)
Where a person receives property from or on account of another, and is under an obligation to the other to retain and deal with that property or its proceeds in a particular way, the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the other.
```

The Theft Act 1968, s 5(3) enables the prosecution to prove that the property still belongs to another for the purposes of the Act, without the need to use the Theft Act 1968, s 5(1), which could involve much more complex legal issues.

However, the Theft Act 1968, s 5(3) will only operate where the accused is under a **legal obligation** to use the property for the purpose given. This is a matter of law which will be decided by the judge, having regard to civil law.

Very often there will be a trust which means that the property will also belong to another under s 5(1) which covers equitable interests. However, it is better to use s 5(3) which allows the prosecution to make out its case more easily without having to resort to the technicalities of trusts law.

Following an analysis of the cases set out below, it appears that the courts have taken the view that particular arrangements should have been made with the defendant regarding the specified property.

### Finding a Legal Obligation

| Case                                                | Summary & Ratio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[R v Hall [1972] 2 All ER 1009]]                   | The travel agent that put client money towards the general running of the business. Shows that a legal obligation may not exist in business circumstances if there is no expectation or undertaking that money be kept separately, for example. |
| [[Davidge v Bunnett [1984] Crim LR 297]]            | Flatmate spent the gas bill money on Christmas presents. Shows a legal obligation can be found in domestic circumstances.                                                                                                                       |
| [[R v Breaks and Huggan [1998] Crim LR 349]]        | For s 5(3) to apply, D must be under a legal obligation to deal with the property in a particular way. This is a matter of law decided by the judge rather than having automatic application.                                                   |
| [[R v Klineberg and Marsden [1999] 1 Cr App R 427]] | There was a legal obligation to deal with some timeshare purchasers property or proceeds in a particular way as the defendants had given express assurances that it would be safeguarded by a stake-holding trust company.                      |
| [[R v Wain [1995] 2 Cr App R 660]]                  | The sponsorship notes/ coins raised or the proceeds were held to belong to the trustees of the charity the money was raised for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

s 5(3) does not prevent the defendant having legal ownership, but it provides that, for the purposes of the Act, the property also belongs to another. Under these circumstances, the prosecution would still have to prove that there was a dishonest appropriation, and that a defendant intended to permanently deprive. s 5(3) only deals with one element of theft – 'belonging to another'.

### Property Obtained by Another's Mistake

s 5(4) caters for the situation where title has passed to the defendant due to another's mistake and allows property to belong to another for the purposes of the Act.

As with s 5(3), this provision only requires the obligation, whether that is the case is a matter of law. Under the law of restitution, when someone is aware they have acquired property by a mistake, they are usually under a legal obligation to restore it. Where money is given by a mistake, restitution is always available (note this is an over-simplification).

```ad-statute
title: [s 5(4) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/5)
'Where a person gets property by another's mistake, and is under an obligation to make restoration (in whole or in part) of the property or its proceeds or of the value thereof, then to the extent of that obligation the property or proceeds shall be regarded (as against him) as belonging to the person entitled to restoration, and an intention not to make restoration shall be regarded accordingly as an intention to deprive that person of the property or proceeds.'
```

See [[Attorney-General's Reference (No 1 of 1983) [1984] 3 All ER 369]].

```ad-important
s 5(4) does not prevent the recipient of the property being the legal owner. It provides that, for the purposes of the Act, the property also belongs to the person entitled to restoration.

Under these circumstances, the prosecution would still have to prove that there was a dishonest appropriation, and that a defendant intended to permanently deprive. Section 5(4) notes that if there is an intention not to make restoration of the money, there is an intention to permanently deprive.
```

### Alternative Approach

The Theft Act 1968, s 5(1) states that property belongs to any person having in it any right or interest. This includes equitable interests.

In [[Chase Manhattan Bank v Israel-British Bank [1981] Ch 105]] it was held that a person who gives property by a mistake retains an equitable interest in that property. This civil case was applied in [[R v Shadrokh-Cigari [1988] Crim LR 465]], where the Court of Appeal upheld a conviction for theft of property given by mistake without recourse to section 5(4).

## Dishonesty

The Theft Act 1968 does not define the term 'dishonesty’. It is for a jury to decide whether an appropriation is dishonest.

### Statute

However, [s 2 Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/2) specifies three situations, in which an appropriation of property is not to be regarded as dishonest:

```ad-statute
title: [s 2(1) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/2)

(1) A person’s appropriation of property belonging to another is not to be regarded as dishonest—

(a) if he appropriates the property in the belief that he has in law the right to deprive the other of it, on behalf of himself or of a third person; or

(b) if he appropriates the property in the belief that he would have the other’s consent if the other knew of the appropriation and the circumstances of it; or

(c) (except where the property came to him as trustee or personal representative) if he appropriates the property in the belief that the person to whom the property belongs cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps.
```

Regarding s 2(1)(c), there is no need for D to take reasonable steps; it is only necessary for D to believe that taking such steps will not enable the owner to be found. Although section 2(1)(c) may apply to the original finding, if the owner becomes known to the accused later, then with the application of the [Theft Act 1968, s 3(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/3) (later appropriation), keeping the property at this later stage could be dishonest and therefore theft.

The Theft Act 1968 does not require the defendant's belief to be reasonably held. As long as it is genuinely held, D will not be dishonest. This has been confirmed by the courts in [[R v Robinson [1977] Crim LR 173]].

### Positive Aspect

For situations which are not covered by the Theft Act 1968, s 2(1), it is necessary to turn to a common law test.

For 35 years, the common law test for dishonesty had been that given in the case of [[R v Ghosh, [1982] QB 1053]]. In October 2017 the Supreme Court heard the civil case of[[ Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67]] and in the words of Rupert Jackson LJ in [[Wingate v SRA [2018] EWCA Civ 366]] ‘the tectonic plates of the legal firmament moved.’

```ad-test
title: Dishonesty

In [[Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67]] the Supreme Court gave two questions to ask:

1. What was the defendant’s knowledge and belief as to the facts?
2. Given that knowledge and those beliefs, was the defendant dishonest by the standards of ordinary decent people?
```

What was said about the criminal law test for dishonesty in Ivey was obiter dictum. However, as unanimous obiter dictum of the Supreme Court it is highly persuasive. It is even more persuasive in light of the extensive review of the law and the court making it clear that there is unlikely to be an opportunity to change the test in a criminal case.

After some uncertainty in the interim, the Court of Appeal in [[R v Barton [2020] EWCA Crim 575]] provided confirmation that the approach in Ivey properly represents the law on dishonesty in criminal cases.

### Willingness to Pay

The Theft Act 1968, s 2(2) provides that a person can appropriate property dishonestly, despite being willing to pay for the property.

This allows people to be convicted of theft when they take property that the owner does not wish to sell, intending to pay for that property.

```ad-statute
title: [s 2(2) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/2)

(2) A person’s appropriation of property belonging to another may be dishonest notwithstanding that he is willing to pay for the property.
```

### Timing of Dishonesty

The dishonest intent must be formed at a time when the goods belong to another. A person cannot be convicted of theft if D only forms the dishonest intent after ownership of the property has passed to D ([[Edwards v Ddin [1976] 1 WLR 942]]). The general civil rule is that title in property passes at the time at which the parties intend it to pass. Ownership of property usually passes when it is paid for, but ownership of food passes when:

- it is eaten – [[Corcoran v Whent [1977] Crim LR 52]] (at which point it also ceases to be property); or
- possibly before it is eaten, for example when food is ordered and cooked in a restaurant.

Ownership of petrol passes when it is put in a petrol tank.

In the absence of *mens rea* from the outset, the appropriate charge for this type of offence would be making off without payment under [s 3 Theft Act 1978](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/3) which was brought in to cover those who were unable to be convicted of theft in these situations.

In other cases where someone forms a dishonest intent after acquiring the property s 3(1), s 5(3) and s 5(4) Theft Act 1968 may assist in making the defendant liable for theft.

## Intention to Permanently Deprive

The [Theft Act 1968, s 1(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/1) requires that the accused must 'intend to permanently deprive' the owner of their property. There is no requirement that the owner is actually deprived of their property permanently. The defendant must have the intention to permanently deprive at the time of the appropriation.

The Act does not define intention to permanently deprive, and it should be given its ordinary everyday meaning.

```ad-statute
title: [Theft Act 1968, s 6(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/6)

(1) A person appropriating property belonging to another without meaning the other permanently to lose the thing itself is nevertheless to be regarded as having the **intention of permanently depriving the other of it if his intention is to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other’s rights**; and a borrowing or lending of it may amount to so treating it if, but only if, the borrowing or lending is for a period and in circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal.
```

```ad-warning
The [Theft Act 1968, s 6](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/6) should not be referred to where it is clear that the defendant does intend the owner to lose their property permanently: [[R v Lloyd [1985] 2 All ER 661]].
```

### 'Their Own to Dispose Of'

The Theft Act 1968, s 6(1) extends the meaning of intention to permanently deprive to cover certain circumstances when the defendant does not intend the owner to lose the property itself.

Section 6(1) states that if the defendant has an intention to treat the thing as their own to dispose of regardless of the others rights, this will amount to an intention to permanently deprive.

```ad-test
title: 'Their own to dispose of'
The courts have given different ways in which this requirement can be satisfied:
1. The dictionary definition of ‘to dispose of’ ([[R v Cahill [1993] Crim LR 141]])
2.  Intending to treat it in a manner which risks its loss.
3.  More than ‘dealing with’ is required.
```

#### Dictionary Definition

```ad-defn
title: Definition ([[R v Cahill [1993] Crim LR 141]])
The term ‘to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other’s rights’ can be defined as:
- The defendant attempting to sell the owner their own property
- The defendant using the owner’s property for bargaining
- Rendering the property useless
```

The dictionary definition in [[R v Cahill [1993] Crim LR 141]] accords with what had been stated previously by Lord Lane in [[R v Lloyd [1985] 2 All ER 661]]. He said the first part of the Theft Act 1968, s 6(1) covers situations where the defendant takes things and then offers them back to the owner to buy if they wish. He said it also covers 'ransom cases' where D will only return the owner's property on the fulfilment of a condition.

#### Intending to Treat it in a Manner Which Risks Loss

Another, wider, meaning of the phrase ‘his intention is to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other’s rights’ was given by the Court of Appeal in [[R v Fernandes [1996] 1 Cr App R 175]]

```ad-defn

A wider definition of the term ‘to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other’s rights’ is intending to treat it in a manner which risks its loss

#### More Than Dealing with Required

‘To dispose of' does not simply mean dealing with the property, as it was previously thought. If ‘to dispose of’ simply meant dealing with the property the phrase ‘to dispose of’ is superfluous. This was not thought to be what Parliament intended ([[R v Mitchell [2008] EWCA Crim 850]]).

A review of all the important cases on this element was undertaken by the Court of Appeal in [[R v Vinall [2011] EWCA 2652]]. Pitchford LJ said:

> 'What section 6(1) requires is a state of mind in the defendant which Parliament regards as the equivalent of an intention permanently to deprive, namely "his intention to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights". The subsection does not require that the thing has been disposed of, nor does it require that the defendant intends to dispose of the thing in any particular way. No doubt evidence of a particular disposal or a particular intention to dispose of the thing will constitute evidence of the defendant's state of mind but it is, in our view, for the jury to decide upon the circumstances proved whether the defendant harboured the statutory intention.'

### Borrowing

The second half of [s 6(1) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/6) states that borrowing or lending of property can amount to intending to treat it as their own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights. This will be the case if the borrowing or lending is for a period and in circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal.

The key case on what constitutes circumstances making it equivalent to an outright taking or disposal is [[R v Lloyd [1985] 2 All ER 661]].

The question to ask where property has been borrowed is: 'Was the intention to return it minus all its goodness, virtue and practical value?’ If the answer is 'yes', then this will be equivalent to an outright taking or disposal, which the Theft Act 1968, s 6(1) states counts as treating it as D’s own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights, which is equivalent to having an intention to permanently deprive.

### S 6(2)

The Theft Act 1968, section 6(2) states that a person who parts with property under a condition as to its return, which they may not be able to perform, is deemed to be treating the property as their own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights.

Cases where D pledges P's property as security for a loan are explored. At the time D may intend to redeem the loan and return the property to P. However, P has parted with the property under a condition as to its return which D might not be able to fulfil.

```ad-statute
title: [Theft Act 1968, s 6(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/6)

(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, where a person, having possession or control (lawfully or not) of property belonging to another, parts with the property under a condition as to its return which he may not be able to perform, this (if done for purposes of his own and without the other’s authority) amounts to treating the property as his own to dispose of regardless of the other’s rights.
```

#### Interchangeable Property

When assessing whether there is an intention to permanently deprive, the courts have considered the actual property taken and disregarded an intention to replace it with equivalent property.

The case of [[R v Velumyl [1989] Crim LR 299]] relates to the issue of an intention to permanently deprive and should not be confused with [[R v Wain [1995] 2 Cr App R 660]], which was concerned with whether the property could be said to belong to another by virtue of the Theft Act 1968, s 5(3).

## Omerod

In [[R v Atkpu [1994] QB 69]], the court concluded that on a strict construction, Gomez left little room for a continuous course of action. The court did not recognise this consequence and preferred the view that the appropriation continues so long as the thief can sensibly be regarded as in the act of stealing, or so long as he is 'on the job'.
