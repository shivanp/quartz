# Recklessness

Many offences allow for this type of mens rea, and it is often the alternative option to intention.

Take, for example, the offence of criminal damage. Where the defendant does not intend to destroy or damage property belonging to another, D can still be liable where D recklessly destroys or damages property belonging to another: Criminal Damage Act 1971, s 1(1).

## Definition

Recklessness is when a person does not intend to cause a harmful result but sees a risk of harm and goes ahead anyway. In order to be criminally liable for reckless behaviour, the risk taking must be unjustifiable. If risk taking is justifiable, there is social utility or value to the activity, against the likelihood and the amount of harm that might happen.

> ‘It is impossible to say in general terms that recklessness requires any particular degree of probability of the occurrence of the harm in question. If the conduct has no social utility—for example, a game of ‘Russian roulette’ or an armed robbery—the slightest possibility of any harm should be enough. If the act has a high degree of social utility—for example, the performance of a surgical operation—then only a very high degree of probability of grave harm that outweighs the social utility will suffice to condemn it as reckless.’

### Current Definition

Comes from [[R v G and another [2003] UKHL 50]].

 Lord Bingham, with whom the other judges agreed, approved the following definition of recklessness laid down in Clause 18 of the Law Commission's Draft Criminal Code (1989):

> 'A person acts recklessly within the meaning of section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 with respect to –
>
> (i) a circumstance when he is aware of a risk that it exists or will exist;
>
> (ii) a result when he is aware of a risk that it will occur;
>
> and it is, in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take the risk.'

The Court of Appeal in [[A-G’s Reference (No 3 of 2003) [2004] 2 Crim App R 367]] held that the test in R v G should be of general application.

### Second Part of Test

The second part of the test of recklessness states:

> ‘in the circumstances known to him, it was unreasonable to take the risk.’

Although the risk must have been **objectively unreasonable**, it is clear that the risk under consideration is the risk **seen by the defendant**.

In deciding whether the risk is a reasonable one to take, the jury will consider the **social utility** of what the defendant is doing. If there is no social utility at all, then the jury will probably decide that even a tiny risk is unjustified.

In R v G the Lords emphasised that the jury should not take into consideration circumstances not known to the accused at the time D committed the offence.

```ad-example
If the accused throws a lighted cigarette into an empty waste paper bin which, unknown to D, contains a small quantity of flammable fluid put there by someone else, the jury must ignore the presence of this flammable fluid when answering the second question.
