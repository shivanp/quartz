# Self-defence

## Definition

The term 'self-defence’ can be taken to cover a number of defences, where a person acts to:

- protect themselves;
- protect someone else;
- protect property;
- prevent a crime; or
- assist in the arrest of an offender.

The defence of self-defence (which includes defending another and protecting property) is a long-established common law defence, which, if successfully pleaded, results in an acquittal.

This is supplemented by a statutory defence contained in the [Criminal Law Act 1967, s 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/3) (which works in almost exactly the same way as common law self-defence).

In recent times, these defences have proved controversial, with many politicians and others calling either for greater clarity of the existing rights of ordinary people to defend themselves or for additional protection for such people, especially homeowners who are faced by potentially violent burglars in their own homes. Celebrated and controversial cases such as those involving Tony Martin and Munir Hussain led to calls for clarification of or changes to the law.

### Statutory or Mixed?

Successive governments have responded to calls for reform with legislation, contained within the [s 76 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/76) (CJIA 2008), as amended twice in 2012 and 2013.

The CJIA 2008, s 76 does not purport to set out in comprehensive form the whole of the law relating to these defences. It does not codify all the provisions of either the common law defence or the statutory defence under the Criminal Law Act 1967 (which remains in force). Section 76(1)(b) states that it applies when ‘the question arises whether the degree of force used by D against a person (“V”) was reasonable in the circumstances’. This is the second part of the common law test – the response.

In, [[R (on the application of Denby Collins) v the Secretary of State for Justice [2016] EWHC 33 (Admin)]], Sir Brian Leveson noted that s 76 governs the second limb of the defence. However, earlier cases, such as [[R v Dawes, Hatter and Bower [2013] EWCA Crim 322]] had adopted the section as applying to both parts of the defence, and this approach is followed in Smith, Hogan and Ormerod.

### Statutory and Common Law Defences

The CJIA 2008, s 76(2) identifies the defences to which the section applies:

- (a) the common law defence of self-defence; and
- (aa) the common law defence of property; and
- (b) the defence provided by section 3(1) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 … (use of force in prevention of crime or making arrest).

The common law defence envisaged two possible reasons for acting:

- In the protection of life and limb of yourself or another: see e.g., [[R v Gladstone Williams (1984) 78 Cr App R 276 (CA)]].
- In the protection of property: [[R v Hussey (1925) 18 Cr App R 160 (CA)]].

What is clear is that self defence can only be used to protect yourself or another, or property from imminent attack: i.e., from a threat of physical force, not a threat to one's peace of mind, [[R v Bullerton (1992) NLJ 1725]]:

>'In our view, the question raised is one of great importance; is a citizen entitled to defend himself against psychological and emotional attack by physical means or must he reply in kind?

>

>The appellant believed the force he used was necessary to prevent the harm to himself from occurring. But we feel constrained to agree with the judge below that physical force may not be used to prevent psychological harm. Like must be met with like.’

> [!statute] s 3 Criminal Law Act 1967
> (1) A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large.
> 
> (2) Subsection (1) above shall replace the rules of the common law on the question when force used for a purpose mentioned in the subsection is justified by that purpose.

In many instances, the common law plea of self-defence overlaps with the plea under the Criminal Law Act 1967, s 3. The same legal rules apply to both defences, so the courts and commentators usually refer to self-defence without specifying whether they are referring to the common law defence or that contained in the Criminal Law Act 1967.

For the most part, the CJIA 2008, s 76 was intended to clarify both the common law and the statutory defences. It initially made no discernible changes to the previous law, but simply re-enacted the old common law principles in statutory form. However, the most recent amendments do seek to make a change to the law that applies where the defendant seeking to make use of any of these defences is a 'householder’.

The CJIA 2008, s 76(9) states:

> 'This section, except so far as making different provision for householder cases, is intended to clarify the operation of the existing defences mentioned in subsection (2).'

Note that all references to a 'defence' or 'defences' below can be taken to refer to all or any of the defences listed here.

## Entitlement

> [!test] Entitlement to Defences
> 
> A defendant is entitled to rely on any of these defences if:
> - the defendant honestly believed that the use of force was necessary; and
> - the level of force the defendant used in response was objectively reasonable in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.
> 
> These two requirements have been referred to as the trigger and the response.
> 
> Note that it is for the prosecution to disprove that the defendant acted in self-defence. It is an all or nothing general defence, so D will either be acquitted by self-defence or the defence will fail.

In [[R v Clegg [1995] 1 AC 482]] it was held that self-defence is a complete defence against all crimes. However, if it fails in any way, the defence will fail in its entirety, e.g., if a defendant uses slightly excessive force, there is no partial defence of self-defence. However, where the charge that the defendant is facing is murder, and a defence of self-defence fails, it is possible that a jury will convict the defendant of the lesser offence of voluntary manslaughter on the basis of a loss of control: see [[R v Dawes, Hatter and Bower [2013] EWCA Crim 322]].

### Trigger

D honestly believed that the use of force was necessary. A defendant is to be judged on the facts as they subjectively believed them to be, whether the belief is reasonable or not.

For instance, if a defendant mistakenly believed that they were being attacked with a deadly weapon and used such force as was reasonable to repel an attack with a deadly weapon, then D has a defence; it is immaterial that they were mistaken, and they were in fact being attacked with something less deadly.

The common law authority for this is [[R v Gladstone Williams (1984) 78 Cr App R 276 (CA)]].

### Mistake Induced by Voluntary Intoxication

If the mistaken belief is due to the voluntary intoxication of the defendant, then the defendant will not be able to rely on their mistake ([[R v O'Connor [1991] Crim LR 135]]). This is the case whether the crime committed is a specific or basic intent crime. This approach is confirmed in s 76(5) CJIA 2008 and applied in [[R v Hatton [2005] EWCA Crim 2951]]

### No Duty of Retreat

Despite the fact that the force must have been reasonable, there is no duty to retreat in English law. Although, the fact that the defendant had an opportunity to retreat may be regarded as a relevant factor.

In [[R v Bird [1985] 1 WLR 816]] Lord Diplock said:

> 'There is however, no rule of law that a person attacked is bound to run away if he can, but it has been said that … "what is necessary is that he should demonstrate by his actions that he does not want to fight. He must demonstrate that he is prepared to temporise and disengage and perhaps to make some physical withdrawal." It is submitted that it goes too far to say that action of this kind is necessary. A demonstration by the accused that at the time he did not want to fight is, no doubt, the best evidence that he was acting reasonably and in good faith in self defence; but it is no more than that. A person may in some circumstances so act without temporising, disengaging or withdrawing; and he should have a good defence.'

### Anticipatory Self-defence

A defendant may make the first blow and still rely on the defence. However, there is no doubt that the principles set out here are still applicable.

In [[AG's Reference (No 2 of 1983) [1984] QB 456]], Lord Lane CJ stated that the accused would be entitled to the defence of self-defence if:

> '… his object was to protect himself or his family or his property against imminent apprehended attack and to do so by means which he believed were no more than reasonably necessary to meet the force used by the attackers.’

[[Beckford v R [1988] AC 130]] Per Lord Griffiths:

> 'A man about to be attacked does not have to wait for his assailant to strike the first blow or fire the first shot; circumstances may justify a pre-emptive strike.'

[[Devlin v Armstrong [1971] NI 13 (NI CA)]] Per MacDermott LJ:

> 'The plea of self-defence may afford a defence where the party raising the defence uses force, not merely to counter an actual attack, but to ward off or prevent an attack which he honestly anticipated. In that case, however, the anticipated attack must be imminent …'

Self-defence may be used by an antagonist: [[R v Forrester [1992] Crim LR 792]] and [[R v Rashford [2005] EWCA Crim 3377]] (The Court of Appeal held that self-defence is not automatically precluded in a situation where the defendant was the initial aggressor and the victim retaliated).

In [[R v Keane and McGrath [2010] EWCA Crim 2514]] the Court of Appeal said:

> 'The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, s 76 did not alter the law as it had stood for many years … It was not the law that where a defendant had either started the fight with the victim, or entered it willingly, that would always and inevitably be a bar to self-defence arising. Self-defence could arise in the case of the original aggressor, but only where the violence offered by the victim was so out of proportion to what the original aggressor did that the roles were effectively reversed …’

#### Force Can Be Used Against an Innocent Third Party

[[R v Hichens [2011] 2 Cr App R 26]] the jury has concluded that the defendant believed that force was necessary because they or someone else was facing an imminent attack, or D believed they were facing an imminent attack. The jury must go on to consider the level of force used in response to that threat. The level of force must be reasonable. The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (as amended) works on the assumption that what is reasonable will depend on the circumstances in which the force is used and differentiates between:

- non-'householder' cases; and
- 'householder' cases, to which s 76(5) applies.

This is an objective test.

[[R v Owino [1996] 2 Cr App R 128]]:

> 'The essential elements of self defence are clear enough. The jury must decide whether the defendant honestly believed that the circumstances were such as to require the use of force to defend himself from an attack or a threatened attack. In this respect, a defendant must be judged in accordance with his honest belief, even though that belief may have been mistaken. But the jury must then decide whether the force used was reasonable in the circumstances as he believed them to be.'

It is also worth noting that the Court of Appeal held in [[R v Harvey [2009] EWCA Crim 469]] that the defendant must be judged not just on the circumstances as they believed them to be, but also on the danger as they believed it to be.

Also, in [[R v Press and Thompson [2013] EWCA Crim 1849]] a soldier, who had just completed a tour of Afghanistan, was allowed to rely on psychiatric evidence that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder to substantiate his mistaken beliefs.

Therefore, in considering the force used, the jury must decide if the force used was objectively reasonable, given the facts as the defendant subjectively believed them to be, CJIA 2008, s 76(3), s76(4) and s76(6).

Several cases have emphasised that, when considering whether the force used was reasonable, the jury must bear in mind that the defendant may have acted 'in the heat of the moment'.

In [[A-G's Reference for N Ireland (No 1 of 1975) [1977] AC 105]], Lord Diplock stated:

> 'The jury should remind themselves that the postulated balancing of risk against risk, harm against harm, by the reasonable man is not undertaken in the calm analytical atmosphere of the courtroom after counsel, with the benefit of hindsight, have expounded at length the reasons for and against the kind of degree of force that was used by the accused; but in the brief second or two which the accused had to decide whether to shoot or not and under all the stresses to which he was exposed.’

In [[Palmer v R [1971] AC 814]] Lord Morris stated:

> 'If there has been an attack so that defence is reasonably necessary, it will be recognised that a person defending himself cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his necessary defensive action. If a jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary, that would be most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken.’

The two points made by s 76(7) replicate the common law:

- S 76(7)(a)-
- ‘that a person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action’ is derived from Palmer v R; and
- ‘in the circumstances one did not use jewellers’ scales to measure reasonable force’ comes from Geoffrey Lane J in [[Reed v Wastie [1972] Crim LR 221]].
- S 76(7)(b)- ‘that evidence of a person's having only done what the person honestly and instinctively thought was necessary for a legitimate purpose constitutes strong evidence that only reasonable action was taken by that person for that purpose’ is also taken from R v Palmer.

> [!summary]
> - Self-defence can be used to protect yourself, another or property from attack or imminent anticipated physical attack. It can also be used to prevent a crime or assist in the arrest of an offender.
> - It is a defence that is found in both common law and the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, s.76 (as amended). The defendant is entitled to rely on the defence if the trigger and response are satisfied:
> - The defendant honestly believed that the use of force was necessary (the trigger)
> - Subjective test, whether the belief is reasonable or not. However, if a mistaken belief is due to the voluntary intoxication of the defendant, then the defendant will not be able to rely on their mistake.
> - There is no duty to retreat but the opportunity to do so may be a relevant factor.
> - It can be used by an antagonist and it can be used against an innocent third party.
> - The level of force the defendant used in response was objectively reasonable in the circumstances and the danger as the defendant subjectively believed them to be (the response).
> - Force will not be reasonable if it was disproportionate. In deciding this the jury must take into account that:
> - A person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh to a nicety the exact measure of any necessary action; and
> - That evidence of a person's having only done what the person honestly and instinctively thought was necessary for a legitimate purpose constitutes strong evidence that only reasonable action was taken by that person for that purpose.
> - The defendant can be mistaken and the mistake does not ned to be a reasonable one.
> 
> Note that it is for the prosecution to disprove that the defendant acted in self-defence. It is an all or nothing general defence, so D will either be acquitted by self-defence or the defence will fail.

## Householder Cases

A defendant is entitled to rely on any of self-defence if:

- Trigger – the defendant honestly believed that the use of force was necessary; and
- Response – the level of force the defendant used in response was objectively **reasonable** in the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.

The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act (‘CJIA’) 2008 (as amended) works on the assumption that what is reasonable will depend on the circumstances in which the force is used and differentiates between:

- non-'householder' cases – force will not be reasonable if it was disproportionate; and
- 'householder' cases - force will not be reasonable if it was grossly disproportionate.

Here, the objective was to make it easier for a defendant who is a 'householder' to make use of the defences. It had been thought that this provision brought about a change in the law and that the use of force in householder cases did not have to be reasonable.

[[R (on the application of Denby Collins) v the Secretary of State for Justice [2016] EWHC 3]]

However, this was held not to be the case by the High Court. Here, the Court was considering what the test for self-defence should be as a result of the amendments and whether the amendments were in accordance with Article 2 European Convention of Human Rights.

### What Does Brian Think

Sir Brian Leveson concluded:

>‘Having regard to the analysis above, I am satisfied that s. 76(5A) of the 2008 Act does not extend the ambit in law of the second limb of self-defence but, properly construed, provides emphasis to the requirement to consider all the circumstances permitting a degree of force to be used on an intruder in householder cases which is reasonable in all the circumstances (whether that degree of force was disproportionate or less than disproportionate).’

>

>‘To summarise, on a proper construction of s. 76(5A), its true meaning and effect is:

>

>Whether the degree of force used in any case is reasonable is to be considered by reference to the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be (the common law and s. 76(3));

>

>A householder is not regarded as having acted reasonably in the circumstances if the degree of force used was grossly disproportionate (s. 76(5A));

>

>A degree of force that went completely over the top prima facie would be grossly disproportionate;

>

>However, a householder may or may not be regarded as having acted reasonably in the circumstances if the degree of force used was disproportionate.’

Sir Brian Levesen said that for householder cases there is a two-part test for the second limb of self-defence. First, the jury must be asked if the force was grossly disproportionate in the circumstances, as the defendant believed them to be. If it was, there can be no defence. If it was not, secondly, the jury must be asked whether the level of force was reasonable.

He noted that the effect and purpose of making a different category of householder cases was to allow a discretionary area of judgment with a different emphasis from non-householder cases. The most obvious example would be the extent to which it is appropriate to take account of the opportunity to retreat. He said it was clear that, as with non-householder cases, the jury should take into account the matters referred to in R v Palmer and codified in CJIA 2008, s 76(7) – that the level of force should not be weighed to a nicety and that if the defendant believed in a moment of unexpected anguish that they were using reasonable force, that was very good evidence that the force was reasonable.

### More Cases

In [[R v Ray (Steven) [2017] EWCA Crim 1391]] the Court of Appeal met with an especially enlarged number of five judges including the Lord Chief Justice to decide the matter in this case. It approved the approach in [[R (on the application of Denby Collins) v the Secretary of State for Justice [2016] EWHC 3]].

Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd CJ said that once the jury had determined the facts as the defendant believed them to be it should determine whether the use of force was grossly disproportionate. If it was, then the degree of force used was unreasonable and the defence would not be available. If the jury decided the degree of force was not grossly disproportionate, it should then decide whether the degree of force was reasonable. The use of disproportionate force which is not grossly disproportionate may or may not be reasonable.

He said it could be pointed out to the jury that what might be an unreasonable degree of force used when confronting an aggressive individual in a club might not be so when used by a householder confronting an intruder in their home, and it is important that the jury assess the defendant’s actions by reference to the circumstances in which D found themselves and as D believed them to be.

> ‘It would often be helpful, for that purpose, to spell out the kind of circumstances which the jury should consider in determining whether the degree of force used by a householder was reasonable. These might, for example, include the shock of coming upon an intruder, the time of day, the presence of other help, the desire to protect the home and its occupants, the vulnerability of the occupants, particularly children, or the picking up of an object (such as a knife or stick that would be lawfully to hand in the home), the conduct of the intruder at the time (or on any relevant previous occasion if known to the defendant). Each of these might lead to the view that what was done, such as using a knife, which otherwise in a different context might be unreasonable, in the circumstances of a householder coming on an intruder might, in all the circumstances of such a case, be reasonable.’

### What is a ‘householder case’?

In summary, a householder case is one where the defendant:

- Relies on the common law defence of self-defencei.e., protecting yourself or another but not protecting property, preventing a crime or assisting in the arrest of an offender.
- Uses force while in or partly in a building, or part of a building, that is a dwelling or is forces accommodation (or is both):
- ‘building’ includes a vehicle or vessel; and
- ‘part of a building, that is a dwelling’ includes places of work and internal access routes:
- if the defendant or another person dwells in part of a building; and
- another part of the building is a place of work for D or another person; and
- you can move between the dwelling and place of work through an internal access route.
- Is not a trespasser at the time the force is used; and
- Believed the victim to be in, or entering, the building or part as a trespasser.

Non-householder cases are those which do not meet these criteria.

See CJIA 2008, s 76(8A)–(8F)

> [!summary]
> This element considered one of the general defences to a crime, self-defence, in particular ‘householder’ cases.
> 
> A householder case is one where D:
> - Acts to protect themselves or another.
> - Uses force while in or partly in a building, or part of a building, that is a dwelling (including vehicles, vessels and buildings that are dwellings and places of work if connected by an internal access route);
> - Is not a trespasser at the time the force is used; and
> - Believed the victim to be in, or entering, the building or part as a trespasser.
> 
> The ‘trigger’ is unchanged but the ‘response’ is more lenient towards householders.
> 
> The jury must be asked two questions:
> - Was the force was grossly disproportionate in the circumstances as D believed them to be? If it was, there can be no defence.
> - If not, was the level of force reasonable? The jury should take into account that the level of force should not be weighed to a nicety and that if the defendant believed in a moment of unexpected anguish that they were using reasonable force, that was very good evidence that the force was reasonable. R v Ray (Steven) listed circumstances which the jury should consider in determining whether the degree of force used by a householder was reasonable e.g. the shock of coming upon an intruder, the time of day, the vulnerability of the occupants, particularly children etc.

## Wording

The woman must honestly believe that it was necessary to use force to protect another (the trigger) – a subjective question. The force used must be reasonable (the response) – an objective question but judged on the facts as the defendant believed them to be. When assessing her response, this case should be identified as a householder case (**s 76(8A)**), as the act took place in a dwelling house, the woman was not a trespasser and she believed the man was a trespasser. First it must be asked if the force was grossly disproportionate, **s 76(5A).** If it was, the woman cannot use the defence. If it was not, then it must be asked if the force was reasonable, **_R v Ray (Steven)._**
