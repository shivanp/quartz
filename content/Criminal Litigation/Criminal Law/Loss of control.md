# Loss of control

## Context

The Law Commission published a report in 2006 proposing a wholesale restructuring of the law of homicide. The government's response was the [Coroners and Justice Act 2009](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/contents) (CJA 2009). This made significant changes to the special defences to murder. The defence of provocation was abolished and was replaced with 'loss of control’.

There are three key requirements of the loss of control defence ([Coroners and Justice Act 2009, s 54(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/54)) provides:

> 'Where a person ('D') kills or is a party to the killing of another ('V'), D is not to be convicted of murder if—
>
> a) D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing resulted from D's loss of self-control,
>
> b) the loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger, and
>
> c) a person of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of D, might have reacted in the same or in a similar way to D.'

- D must have lost self-control;
- due to the fear and/ or anger qualifying trigger; and
- a normal person might have acted in a similar way to D.

## Principles

Loss of control is a **partial** defence to murder. The burden of proof rests with the prosecution once the issue is raised, [CJA 2009, s54(5)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/54).

```ad-important

The prosecution need to prove that only one of the components is absent for the defence to fail, this is clear from the statute and was confirmed in the first case on the new defence, [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]].
```

It will be a matter for the judge to decide whether the defence can be put before the jury, [CJA 2009, s 54(6)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/54). The power of the judge to remove the issue of loss of control from the jury may prove to be a significant change from the old law of provocation, [[R v Jewell [2014] EWCA Crim 414]].

If this defence is successful, the conviction is reduced from murder to voluntary manslaughter, which means that the defendant will avoid the mandatory life sentence.  
s 54(7).

Note that some aspects of the defence are yet to be defined and tested by the courts, so statutory interpretation is required.

The three requirements are considered.

## 1. Loss of Control

The defendant’s act or omission in killing, must have resulted from a loss of self-control.

In [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]], the Court of Appeal made it clear that this defence had replaced the old law on provocation and that application of this defence should be made with reference to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. The judges were of the opinion that the old common law is now largely irrelevant. It seems that the use of old case law is now very limited. It can be referred to, but any use must be justified.

The element of loss of self-control can be assessed by looking at its literal meaning. As under the old law, whether the defendant actually lost control is a question for the jury, taking into account all of the evidence.

 

Loss of self-control was a necessary part of the old law and reference can be made to the legal principle from [[R v Richens [1993] 4 All ER 877]], which stated that, although there need not be a complete loss of control so that defendants do not know what they are doing, defendants must be unable to restrain themselves. A mere loss of temper would not be enough.

The loss of control needs not be sudden: [CJA 2009, s 54(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/54).

In [[R v Ahulwalia [1992] 4 All ER 889]] it was noted that the jury, in deciding whether there was a loss of self-control, should consider the length of any delay between the provocation and the killing. The longer the delay, the less likely it was that the defendant had lost self-control. This observation would apply to the loss of control defence.

The defence will be lost should it be established that the defendant was acting out of a 'considered desire for revenge’, CJA 2009, s 54(4). The judges in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]] directed that this should be considered within this aspect of the defence.

## 2. Qualifying Trigger

The 'qualifying trigger' that must be identified as the cause of the loss of control is defined in the [CJA 2009, s 55](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/55).

Note that only one of the below triggers is needed.

Lord Judge in Clinton, made it clear that it would be more difficult to raise the loss of control defence than the old defence:

> 'In section 55(3) it is not enough that the defendant is fearful of violence. He must fear serious violence. In subsection (4)(a) the circumstances must not merely be grave, but extremely so. In subsection (4)(b) it is not enough that the defendant has been caused by the circumstances to feel a sense of grievance. It must arise from a justifiable sense not merely that he has been wronged, but that he has been seriously wronged. By contrast with the former law of provocation, these provisions, as Mr Michael Birnbaum QC, on behalf of Clinton submitted, have raised the bar.’

```ad-statute
title: s 55 CJA 2009

(1) This section applies for the purposes of section 54.

(2) A loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger if subsection (3), (4) or (5) applies.

(3) This subsection applies if D's loss of self-control was attributable to D's fear of serious violence from V against D or another identified person.

(4) This subsection applies if D's loss of self-control was attributable to a thing or things done or said (or both) which-
- a) constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and
- b) caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

(5) This subsection applies if D's loss of self-control was attributable to a combination of the matters mentioned in subsections (3) and (4).

(6) In determining whether a loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger—
- a) D's fear of serious violence is to be disregarded to the extent that it was caused by a thing which D incited to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence;
- b) a sense of being seriously wronged by a thing done or said is not justifiable if D incited the thing to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence.
- (c) the fact that a thing done or said constituted sexual infidelity is to be disregarded.
```

### Fear Trigger

The first trigger, CJA 2009, s 55(3), 'attributes' the loss of self-control to the defendant's fear of serious violence. There is no specific direction on the way in which the defendant should fear serious violence; this would suggest that this defence will have a broader application than it previously did. In [[Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer [2013] EWCA Crim 322]], the Court of Appeal directed that, despite the fact that there may be factual overlaps, loss of control and self-defence are two distinct defences. The court highlighted some important differences: for example, self-defence requires only that the defendant fears violence, whereas the CJA 2009, s 55(3) requires the defendant to fear serious violence.

It seems that in part, this 'trigger' is designed to cover a situation where a jury might conclude that the defendant was justified in using defensive force, but that the level of force used was unreasonable, thus preventing the defence of self-defence from operating.

A good example of this may be found within the Tony Martin case: [[R v Martin (Anthony) [2002] Crim LR 136]]

D cannot rely on the fear trigger if D incited it as an excuse to use violence, sections 55(6)(a).

### Anger Trigger

The second qualifying trigger, informally referred to as the anger trigger, is a more nebulous concept and has three parts to it:

- things said and/ or done;
- that constitute circumstances of an extremely grave nature; and
- that caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

None of these elements are defined in the CJA 2009. Although we have clear direction that both the CJA 2009, s 55(4)(a) & (b) require objective evaluation, confirmed in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]] and [[Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer [2013] EWCA Crim 322]].

#### Limitations

D cannot rely on the anger trigger if:

- D incited it as an excuse to use violence, sections 55(6)(b); or
- The thing said/done constituted sexual infidelitysection 55(6)(c).

#### Things Said or Done (or both)

This was a requirement under the old law, and confirms that there must be something actually said or done. Therefore, circumstances on their own will not be enough.

In [[R v Acott [1996] Crim LR 664]], Lord Steyn made it clear, by way of example, that if a person was driving in slow-moving traffic caused by snow and lost self-control, they would not be able to rely on this defence.

#### Circumstances of an Extremely Grave Nature

The phrase, ‘constitutes circumstances of an extremely grave nature’ is not defined in the CJA 2009. The presence of this phrase must be determined objectively, and these circumstances should not be established easily (Lord Judge in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]]).

Jonathan Herring says he believes:

> ‘….the circumstances facing the D must have been unusual, and not part of the normal trials and disappointments of life. The circumstances could not be events which ordinary people would regard as trivial. So being jostled in a supermarket, having someone queue jump in front of you, or being sworn at would not amount, in themselves, to grave circumstances.’

#### Caused D to Have a Justifiable Sense of Being Seriously Wronged

Reference has been made to the explanatory notes for some guidance on the meaning of the phrase, ‘caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged’. Although the phrase is not defined, the notes do emphasise that the issue of whether this sense of being seriously wronged is justifiable is an objective question. This has since been confirmed in Clinton.

Further direction can be taken from Dennis Baker and Lucy Zhao (2012) 76 Journal of Criminal Law 254 at pp. 263-269:

> '… Similarly, the word “justifiable” in s 55(4)(b) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 means that the defendant's sense of being seriously wronged must be one that accords with contemporary society's norms and values. In other words, it must be shown that a normal person in contemporary Britain would have felt seriously wronged in the same situation. This is judged according to the normative standards of a normal person communally situated in Britain.

```ad-example
An honour killer may have in fact lost control upon learning of his 20-year-old daughter's love affair with a man of a different race or religious faith. Additionally, he may have in fact felt seriously wronged by his daughter's conduct, but this will not qualify as an “objective” trigger for his loss of control. 

The fact he “personally” felt wronged and “subjectively” viewed the circumstances as being of an extremely grave character is irrelevant as far as the new defence is concerned. A normal person communally situated in contemporary Britain would not consider discovering his adult daughter dating someone of a different race or religious faith as constituting extremely grave circumstances. 

A normal relationship between a consenting adult couple does not constitute extremely grave circumstances, and a normal parent in contemporary Britain would not be unjustifiably wronged in an objective sense by having to deal with his or her adult daughter's decision to choose her own partner.
```

```ad-example
Compare this with the situation where a parent arrives at a kindergarten to pick up her child and finds a paedophile teacher molesting her child. Clearly, the latter would constitute objective provocation when measured against contemporary standards in Britain. A normal parent communally situated in contemporary society would have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged by such conduct.

It is important to note that there is no need for the parent actually to catch the paedophile teacher in the act; it would be enough if it were “said” to him or her that there is a teacher in the building who has just been caught molesting your toddler. 

For example, if the mother uses her smartphone to inform her husband, who is waiting outside the kindergarten, that she has just found a paedophile teacher molesting their child, the husband could raise the defence if what has been “said” to him (i.e., “I found the teacher molesting our child”) causes him to lose control and run into the kindergarten and kill the paedophile teacher. The husband is provoked by the paedophile's act, even though he did not witness it. Second-hand word of such an act would have the same objective provocative effect as witnessing it.
```

## 3. Normal Person Test

[CJA 2009, s 54(1)(c)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/54) provides:

> 'a person of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the circumstances of D, **might** have reacted in the same or in a similar way to D.'

Section 54(3) provides:

> ‘In subsection (1)(c) the reference to “the circumstances of D” is a reference to all of D's circumstances **other than** those whose only relevance to D's conduct is that they bear on D's general capacity for tolerance or self-restraint.’

To determine whether a normal person might have acted similarly, there are two steps. The jury will have to assess:

1. The gravity of the qualifying trigger to a person in the defendant’s circumstances; then
2. Whether as a result of that trigger a normal person might have done what the defendant did or something similar.

Lord Diplock in [[DPP v Camplin [1978] AC 705]]:

> 'To taunt a person because of his race, his physical infirmities or some shameful incident in his past may well be considered by the jury to be more offensive to the person addressed, however equable his temperament, if the facts on which the taunt is founded are true than it would be if they were not.'

The test for determining the proportionality of D’s reaction remains a wholly-objective one. The normal person will have ordinary powers of tolerance and self-restraint. The jury will not be allowed to take into account any characteristics or circumstances that would affect normal tolerance and the ability to exercise restraint.

### Circumstances and Characteristics

Characteristics or circumstances likely to be excluded in assessing the normal person’s capacity for tolerance and self-restraint:

- Bad temper
- Intoxication
- Extreme sensitivity
- Post-traumatic stress disorder, [[R v Rejmankski [2017] EWCA Crim 2061]]
- Personality disorder, [[R v Rejmankski [2017] EWCA Crim 2061]]

There are three categories to consider:

1. circumstances and characteristics will be taken into account under s54(1)(c);
2. circumstances and characteristics which will be excluded by s54(3); and
3. circumstances or characteristics which will be considered in assessing the magnitude of the qualifying trigger, but ignored in assessing how much tolerance and self-restraint the normal man would have.

In Clinton, Lord Judge pointed out that as the statute requires the jury to take into account all the circumstances, they could find themselves in a situation where they are expected to ignore sexual infidelity when considering the qualifying trigger, but could take it into account here. If there is evidence that the jury feel is relevant to the overall evaluation, the courts have confirmed that the jury can take sexual infidelity into consideration, regardless of whether it goes towards the gravity of the taunt, provided it does not only go towards the capacity to exercise self-restraint.

Hallet LJ explained how the third category would be dealt with in [[R v Rejmankski [2017] EWCA Crim 2061]]:

> ‘If a mental disorder has a relevance to the defendant’s conduct other than a bearing on his general capacity for tolerance or self-restraint, it is not excluded by subs.(3), and the jury will be entitled to take it into account as one of the defendant’s circumstances under s54(1)(c).
>
> However, it is necessary to identify with some care how the mental disorder is said to be relevant as one of the defendant’s circumstances. It must not be relied upon to undermine the principle that the conduct of the defendant is to be judged against “normal” standards, rather than the abnormal standard of an individual defendant…
>
> The disorder would be a relevant circumstance of the defendant, but would not be relevant to the question of the degree of tolerance and self-restraint which would be exercised by the hypothetical person referred to in s54(1)(c)’.

See also [[R v Wilcocks [2016] EWCA Crim 2043]].

## Limitations

The defence of loss of control cannot be used:

1. In an act of 'considered desire for revenge’.
2. As an excuse to use violence.
3. If the thing said/done constituted sexual infidelity.
4. If the defendant is charged with attempted murder.

We will consider each of these limitations in greater detail.

### Considered Desire for Revenge

This defence cannot be used if it stems from an act of revenge: Coroners and Justice Act (CJA) 2009, s 54(4).

This would cover cases where there is clear evidence of planning.

The word ‘considered’ is important here, as it implies the defendant has had time to think about the qualifying trigger. It is clear that if the defendant is acting out of planned revenge, D will not have lost self-control. The judges in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]] recognised this when they made it clear that s 54(4) must be considered within the first requirement, a loss of self-control.

### Excuse to Use Violence

The defendant cannot create the qualifying trigger as an excuse to use violence.

```ad-statute
title: [CJA 2009, s 55(6)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/55)

(6) In determining whether a loss of self-control had a qualifying trigger—

(a) D's fear of serious violence is to be disregarded to the extent that it was caused by a thing which D incited to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence;

(b) a sense of being seriously wronged by a thing done or said is not justifiable if D incited the thing to be done or said for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence.
```

In *Clinton*, Lord Judge suggested that someone who is out to incite violence may well not 'fear' violence, but actively welcome it, and equally such a person would not feel a sense of being seriously wronged. This suggests that in such circumstances, the defence will always be difficult to run. However, Lord Judge goes on to point out that the CJA 2009, s 55(6)(a) and (b) only apply where the defendant's actions were done with a view to providing an excuse for violence; it is not enough that the defendant 'started it' to invoke CJA 2009, s 55(6). D must have had the intent from the outset to provoke the reaction that then led to the killing. It is therefore only in rare cases that these subsections will apply.

### Sexual Infidelity

The defence cannot be relied on if the thing said/done constituted sexual infidelity ([s 55(6)(c)n CJA 2009](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/55)).

This subsection was brought in to prevent defendants from using sexual infidelity as an excuse for killing.

Much of the [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]] judgment deals with the prohibition contained within, s 55(6)(c). It includes a useful analysis of how complicated it is to determine whether the thing said or done actually constitutes sexual infidelity. It is not as straightforward as it first sounds. The Court of Appeal questions whether the exception under the CJA 2009, s 55(6)(c) should apply in the following scenarios:

- if sexual infidelity is in the background, but is not the true trigger or the sole trigger for the loss of control.
- where there has not in fact been any sexual infidelity because V, or someone else, has lied or made it up to taunt D.
- if the sexual infidelity has not taken place yet, e.g. V is about to leave D for someone else, but has not yet been sexually intimate with them.

Lord Judge quoted from Hansard and chose to interpret the intention of those proposing the clause in the bill as being to exclude the defence **only when sexual infidelity is the sole qualifying trigger**. He said that if there are other things said or done or if there is also a fear of serious violence, then sexual infidelity should be considered. Lord Judge went on to say:

> ‘However, to seek to compartmentalise sexual infidelity and exclude it when it is integral to the facts as a whole is not only much more difficult, but is unrealistic and carries with it the potential for injustice. In the examples we have given earlier in this judgment, we do not see how any sensible evaluation of the gravity of the circumstances or their impact on the defendant could be made if the jury, having, in accordance with the legislation, heard the evidence, were then to be directed to excise from their evaluation of the qualifying trigger the matters said to constitute sexual infidelity, and to put them into distinct compartments to be disregarded.
>
> In our judgment, where sexual infidelity is integral to and forms an essential part of the context in which to make a just evaluation whether a qualifying trigger properly falls within the ambit of subsections 55(3) and 55(4), the prohibition in section 55(6)(c) does not operate to exclude it.’

It is likely that in most cases where sexual infidelity has caused the defendant to lose their self-control, there will be other factors which could make up a qualifying trigger such as the threat that the defendant will lose the children, as was the case in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]], or that they will lose their home. It will then be possible to include sexual infidelity within the argument that a qualifying trigger exists, to ensure that the jury has the 'whole story’.

### Attempted Murder

The CJA 2009 is silent on this point. However, provocation was not available as a defence to a charge of attempted murder: [[R v Campbell [1987] 84 Cr App R 255]].

Smith, Hogan and Ormerod’s, Criminal Law states that loss of control ‘is not a defence to a charge of attempted murder or any other charge other than murder’.

## Omerod's Criminal Law

### Introduction

At common law, all unlawful homicides which are not murder are manslaughter. Customary to divide manslaughter into voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter comprises cases where the defendant had the intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm, but some statutory defined mitigating circumstance reduced it from murder.

```ad-defn
title: Loss of control
Where D kills with the mens rea for murder but at the time he had lost his self control; one of the statutory qualifying triggers applied, and a person of D's age and sex with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint might have done as D did.
```

### Context

Before the 2009 Act, the partial defence was recognised in common law and modified by statute in s 3 Homicide Act 1957. This was a mess, there were disagreements as to the terms of the defence at a high level. The theoretical foundation for the defence remained unclear: was it one of partial justification (deceased had it coming) or of partial excuse (loss of self-control was uncharacteristic). Previous law criticised as discriminatory:

- Women who killed abusive partners were disadvantaged if they did not act in a state which could be described as 'sudden and temporary loss of control'.
- Cumulative effect of years of abuse not considered.
- Mental characteristics arising from an abusive relationship could only be taken into account if relevant to the gravity of the provocation, not to the D's ability to exercise self-control.
- Women unlikely to (be able to) respond lethally when responding to an attack by an abusive partner, so were forced to rely on diminished responsibility.

The Law Commission needed to ask whether the purpose of the defence was to unshackle the judge from imposing the mandatory life sentence, or label more distinctly killers whose conduct might be regarded as morally different.

### 2009 Act

In [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]], Lord Judge CJ emphasised that the old provocation defence is irrelevant when interpreting the 2009 Act.

Note that both s 54 and s 55 define the loss of control defence. It is designed to be a much narrower defence than that afforded by the old provocation defence.

LOSC defence is only applicable to murder. s 54(6): the defence must be left to the jury only if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that a jury could reasonably conclude that the defence may apply (a significant change from the common law position). This is even if the defence has decided not to plead LOSC.

Also note:

- The appellate court will not readily interfere with the judgment of the trial judge.
- The existence of a qualifying trigger does not necessarily connote that there will have been a loss of control.
- The statutory components of the defence are to be appraised sequentially and separately.

This sounds straightforward, but it's still messy because stuff isn't defined clearly, neither in statute nor authoritative case law.

The partial defence cannot apply where there is “a considered desire for revenge” – s 54(4). Note that this is a bit theoretically a bit dubious, but also leads to practical problems, e.g., an abused spouse who kills after years of torment may have a desire for revenge but also be out of control at the time.

The word 'considered' here suggests some element of premeditation, but is undefined. Recall also, there is no requirement for the loss of control to be sudden (s 54(2)).

```ad-question
Is arming oneself evidence of a considered desire for revenge?
```

[[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]]: the Court of Appeal approved that a considered desire for revenge connoted a 'deliberate and considered decision which had been thought about'.

The idea is that thought-out revenge killings are excluded without automatically barring every case where revenge may be part of a complex range of motivations.

### LOC Requirement

'Loss of control' can refer to the failure to exercise self-control, or the inability to do so. This is a subjective test. If D is of an unusually phlegmatic temperament, and it appears that he did not lose his self-control, the fact that a reasonable person in the like circumstances would have done so will not assist D. The test may be best understood as founded on whether D has lost his ability to maintain his actions in accordance with considered judgment or whether he has lost normal powers of reasoning. The threshold is a high one.

Lord Judge in [[Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer [2013] EWCA Crim 322]]:

> “For the individual with normal capacity of self-restraint and tolerance, unless the circumstances are extremely grave, normal irritation, and even serious anger do not often cross the threshold into loss of control”

There must be a loss of control in fact. The jury are entitled to take into account all relevant circumstances. D's failure to testify to her loss of self-control is not necessarily fatal to her case. If D's evidence is that she acted out of fear and panic, that may be indicative that she acted out of self-defence, but not from a loss of control.

The requirement of loss of control is not satisfied by evidence that D acted instinctively. It is also not satisfied for 'mercy' killings. But still better than the old defence which required a 'sudden and temporary' loss of control, who as available too readily to those quick to temper (men) and less accommodating of those able to endure the provoking circumstances before responding with lethal force (women).

It does not matter whether the loss was sudden or not. Better phrase to describe this requirement: 'cumulative provocation'. So if D's response to events was delayed, does not mean there was no loss of control, but will remain difficult to ascertain whether D reached the point of loss of control.

#### Issues

- Loss of self-control is presumably temporary, else it would be a case of insanity
- Once D has raised evidence of it, the burden is on the prosecution to prove to the criminal standard that D had not lost self-control.
- The third element is that D must be judged on the basis that he possesses the 'normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint'. So it seems relevant to consider the time which D had available to reflect and cool off between the triggering event and the killing.
- By including a requirement that D lost control for the defence to apply, it has been argued that thee Govt rendered the LOSC defence incoherent. Note that this limb was not part of the Law Commission recommended scheme.
	- The rationale was to meet concerns that there was a risk of the partial defence being used inappropriately, such as when D killed in cold blood/ gang-feud killing/ honour killing.
	- Argued that to add a loss of control element renders the scheme unnecessarily complex and lacking logic: a person who has lost control cannot easily be described as acting in a state of 'justified' anger.
	- By retaining a loss of control requirement, the government may have reduced the availability of the defence to abused women.

### Qualifying Triggers

Under the old law, there was no restriction on the words or conduct that could be founding the provocation defence. So the provocation could arise from perfectly legal acts by V and others. In [[R v Doughty (1986) 83 Cr App R 319]] provocation should have been left to the jury as a defence to murder where there was evidence that the persistent crying of D's two-week old baby had caused D to lose his self-control and kill it.

The qualifying triggers in the LOSC defence are far more narrow (s 55 CJA 2009). Requires fear of serious violence to V or another identified person, or if loss of self-control was attributable to things done or said which constituted circumstances of an extremely grave character, and caused D to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

Points:

- Requires that the loss of self-control is 'attributable to' a qualifying trigger. This raises the question of whether the term should be construed as requiring something less than a formal causal link. In practice, taken to just mean causation.
- The Court of Appeal has confirmed that the existence of a qualifying trigger requires an objective assessment by the judge at the end of the evidence.
- What would otherwise be sufficient for a qualifying trigger is to be disregarded if D brought that state of affairs upon himself by, e.g., looking for a fight by inciting something to be said or done (s 55(6)).
	- Under the old law, the jury were told to take into account anything said or done according to the effect it would have done on a reasonable person. Literally, the availability of the LOSC defence is wider: it would only be removed from the jury if D's *purpose* was subsequently to use violence.
	- In [[Dawes, Hatter and Bowyer [2013] EWCA Crim 322]], Lord Judge CH held that 'the mere fact that in some general way the defendant was behaving badly and looking for and provoking trouble does not of itself lead to the disapplication of the qualifying triggers based on s 55(3)(4) and (5) unless his actions were intended to provide him with the excuse or opportunity to use violence'.
	- So whether D's purpose was to provide an excuse to use violence is narrower than asking whether a violent reaction was the foreseeable consequence of what D was doing.

#### Fear of Serious Violence (s 55(3))

This limb flows from a Law Commission recommendation designed primarily to accommodate within the partial defence regime women who kill their violent and abusive partners. The trigger is therefore broad on purpose.

Encompasses two circumstances:

1. Where D kills to thwart an anticipated (albeit not imminent) attack
	1. Useful for abused partners who kill.
2. Where D overreacts to what she perceives to be an imminent threat.
	1. Scope for the defence to be used in a very broad range of killings that were previously classed as murder and attracted no defence (e.g., if D stabs V in a pub fight, fearing V would stab him first). This is a significant change in the law.

Defence limited to cases where D fears violence to himself or an identified other. Unclear how narrowly this will be interpreted.

Note that where a defendant is pleading both self-defence and loss of control, it is imperative that the self-defence is addressed first, else a manslaughter conviction becomes compulsory.

What if D's fear of serious violence was based on a mistaken interpretation of the facts? Probably the case that a genuine mistaken belief in facts would amount to a qualifying trigger of a fear of serious violence. It is unclear whether a mistake induced by voluntary intoxication precludes reliance on the defence, but Omerod hopes that a generous approach would be used.

#### S 55(4)

##### Things Said or Done

“Things done or said” – so naturally occurring events are excluded. Note it seems a bit odd to distinguish cases where the trigger is words by a third party (defence available) and naturally occurring events (defence unavailable).

```ad-example
Say a farmers crops were destroyed by an unknown arsonist, and they then attacked their child, the defence would be techincally available. But if the crops were destroyed by a natural fire, it would not be available.
```

There must be some evidence of what was said or what was done, has to be concrete. Note the edge cases:

- where D mistakenly believes that things were said or done when in fact nothing was said or done
- Where words or acts occur, but D mistakes them (e.g., mishears V saying something)

Since 'things said or done' must lead to a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged, perhaps appropriate to ignore intoxicated mistakes unless the mistake is one which D would have made had he been sober.

Likely that the defence will be available where D sought to kill the person responsible for the acts or words, but by accident missed and killed an innocent person. The doctrine of transferred malice should theoretically operate in this situation.

##### Extremely Grave Character

There is nothing to prevent a lawful act by V being sufficient to constitute the trigger, although the fact that the acts or words were lawful will cast doubt on whether D had a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.

The threshold for the second qualifying trigger is that things said and done must constitute circumstances of an extremely grave character. This is not defined, the Law Commission merely said:

> The jury should be trusted to evaluate the relative grossness of provocation, in whatever form it comes, according to their own sense of justice in an individual case.

##### Justifiable Sense of Being Seriously Wronged

'Justifiable sense of being seriously wronged' is meant to be an objective test, intended to provide an opportunity to take into consideration cumulative abuse, which will be particularly important in domestic killings by abused women. It is worth asking whether the sense of serious wrong would be felt by someone in D's circumstances.

Simultaneously, this term was meant to exclude honour killings, racist attacks etc.

In [[R. v Meanza [2017] EWCA Crim 445]] D claimed to have felt aggrieved by being asked to turn down the TV and only being able to see his girlfriend under supervision, in the secure unit in which he was held. The jury held there was no justifiable grievance.

#### Sexual Infidelity

D's loss of control that is attributed to anything said or done which constitutes sexual infidelity is to be disregarded (s 55(6)(c)). This was introduced via Parliament, and was not part of the Law Commission's original proposals. Many judges are uneasy about how explicitly this was excluded, excluding even the possibility of sexual infidelity amounting to provocation.

The restriction on the defence presents difficulties of interpretation and application. The intention was to prevent men relying on the loss of self-control defence when they had lashed out as a result of sexual jealousy.

But in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]], Lord Judge CJ emphasised that D remains at liberty to tell the jury the whole story about the relevant events, including the fact and impact of sexual infidelity, which the jury must consider.

There are numerous problems:

- How 'solid' a relationship must there be before sexual acts with others outside that relationship constitute infidelity? Infidelity connotes a continuing relationship. So theoretically a killing by a spouse or partner might fall outside the defence, but a killing by a jealous stalker would not.
- How widely should sexual infidelity be read? A betrayal by one partner that involved telling the other about an illicit relationship was capable of falling within the prohibition.
- Words may constitute sexual infidelity. What about V bragging to D that he had been having an affair with D's wife?
- Read literally, s 55(6) only forbids regard being had to the fact that the thing said or done constituted sexual infidelity when determining if there is a qualifying trigger. The effect on D of the sexual infidelity is not to be disregarded. This is poor drafting.
- Provided there is some other thing besides sexual infidelity said or done which amounts to extreme circumstances, the trigger will be satisfied. What related aspects can be taken into account? Generally construed widely: other related circumstances can be taken into account.

So D could plausibly claim that it was not the infidelity but another circumstance that caused him to lose control, for example if V threatened to take the kids/ smashed possession as she was leaving/ fact that lover was best friend. Similarly, D came home to find her husband V having sex with her young step-daughter, it would be open to D to argue that it was the sexual abuse and not the sexual infidelity which formed the qualifying trigger.

The combined effect of the statutory drafting and judgment in Clinton is to undermine the practical impact of s 55(6)(c). It is quite rare that sexual infidelity alone would be a qualifying trigger.

So provided that something else has been said or done amounting to extreme circumstances, the trigger will be satisfied.

### Normal Person Test

#### Sexual Infidelity Again

Under s 54(1)(c), the jury must next consider whether a person of D's sex and age, with a normal degree of tolerance and self restraint would have acted in the same or a similar way.

```ad-note
The statute does not at this final stage preclude consideration of the fact of sexual infidelity. Two explanations for illogicality:
1. Could argue that what is being considered in s 54(1)(c) is not the sexual infidelity but its effects on D. So the act causing loss of control could be the effects of the unfaithfulness and betrayal rather than the things (sexually) said or done
2. Jury are allowed to have regard to the act/words in determining whether a person of D's age and sex etc. in his circumstances might have reacted as he did. 

So could argue that there is no contradiction, because the government was seeking to prohibit sexual infidelity as a sole basis for the trigger. 
```

Lord Judge CJ in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]]:

> "to compartmentalise sexual infidelity and exclude it when it was integral to the facts as a whole would be difficult, unrealistic and could lead to injustice".

So accepted that if there is evidence other than sexual infidelity, the partial defence should be left to the jury. This is sometimes criticised, but broadly accepted as sensible and pragmatic.

Note that it is possible to rely on both qualifying triggers.

#### Historiography

Under the old law of provocation, there were confusing case authorities as to whether the defendant's characteristics should be included, and whether the defence should be approached objectively or subjectively.

In [[Smith (Morgan) [2001] AC 146]], a subjective approach was used. But then in [[A-G for Jersey v Holley [2005] UKPC 23]], it was held that characteristics of the accused affecting the gravity of the provocation should be taken into account, but those relating to the ability to exercise self-control should not. This was approved in [[James v Karimi [2006] EWCA Crim 14]].

#### Current Position

The combined effect of s 54(1)(c) and s 54(3) is not to codify the decision in [[A-G for Jersey v Holley [2005] UKPC 23]]. What constitutes a 'normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint' is a matter for the jury to determine according to their judgment and collective life experiences.

Unclear why sex was taken into account, and why mental abnormality was not. Note that the words that a person 'might have reacted in the same or similar way to D' is quite a generous test. There is no express restriction that D's acts must be proportionate to the threat/ trigger.

Lord Judge CJ in [[R v Clinton, Parker and Evans [2012] EWCA Crim 2]] again:

> The defendant's reaction (that is what he actually did, rather than the fact that he lost his self-control) may therefore be understandable in the sense that another person in his situation and circumstances in which he found himself, might have reacted in the same or similar way.

Also note that s 54(3) clarifies s 54(1)(c) so that the reference to 'the circumstances of D' includes 'all of D's circumstances' except those which bear on D's 'general capacity for tolerance and self-restraint'. This opens up a relatively broad range of subjective considerations.

Moreover, s 54(3) only appears to exclude a circumstance on which D seeks to rely if its sole relevance is to diminish D's self-restraint.

- This could open up the opportunity for D to claim e.g., that his intake of alcohol was a relevant circumstance if it had an effect which was not just that of diminishing his self-restraint, say if it led to a relevant mistake.
- If bring drunk only had the effect of diminishing self-restraint, the jury should ask whether a person of D's sex and age with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint in the same circumstances, but unaffected by alcohol, might have reacted in the same or a similar way.

```ad-info
So suppose D was so intoxicated that he mistook V's slap on the back as an attack rather than an act of friendship, and killed him. D's intoxication might bear on his general capacity for tolerance and self-restraint, but it would not be its sole relevance, so would fall in the 'gap' left by the legislation.
```

There is no positive requirement that D's individual circumstances have to affect the gravity of the triggering conduct in order for them to be included in the jury's assessment of what the person of D's age and sex might have done. They only need to have relevance other than to his general capacity for tolerance and self-restraint.

```ad-question
Which, if any, of D's mental conditions are relevant?
```

```ad-example
If D has a learning disability and is provoked, his disability will be relevant even if the taunts relate to something completely different. 
```

```ad-example
If D suffered from a personality disorder which made him unusually likely to become angry and aggressive at the slightest provocation, this could not assist with loss of control. But if D had a personality disorder which had caused him to attempt suicide, then jury is entitled to take into account as one of the circumstances the effect on him of being taunted that he killed himself.
```

#### Rejmanski

The leading case is now [[R v Rejmankski [2017] EWCA Crim 2061]], where it was held that the potential relevance of the mental disorder to each of the elements of LOSC is fact-specific, depending on the nature of D's disorder, the effect on D and the facts of the case.

Moreover, if and in so far as a personality disorder reduced D's general capacity for tolerance or self-restraint, that would not be a relevant consideration. It would not be a relevant consideration even if the personality disorder was one of the circumstances of the defendant because it was relevant to the gravity of the trigger.

In the majority of cases, the personality disorder will be relevant to the gravity of the provocation, as well as the loss of self-control.

Important to note that even in these cases, D's conduct must be judged against normal standards, rather than the abnormal standard of an individual defendant.

Given that loss of control and diminished responsibility may be pleaded together as alternatives, the law does not ignore a mental disorder rendering the defendant unable to exercise the degree of control of a normal person.

```ad-summary
Rejmanski confirms:
1. D's reaction to the qualifying trigger is always assessed against the objective standard required by the legislation
2. The LOSC defence is more generous to defendants than provocation given that there is no positive requirement for D's  circumstances to affect the gravity of the triggering conduct.
