# Actus Reus

## Introduction

There are three main elements of criminal liability:

1. Actus reus (guilty action)
2. Mens rea (guilty mind)
3. Absence of a valid defence

**_Actus reus_** usually refers to the actions of the defendant that are prohibited by law. However, as you will see, the _actus reus_ can be much wider than just doing something. This is an essential element of the offence. To assist in determining the relevant rules, offences can be categorised in a number of different ways. You will see that most crimes can fit into more than one category.

We will look at four types of _actus reus_:

- conduct;
- result;
- circumstances; and
- omissions.

### Conduct Offences

In some cases, offences will only require certain acts to have been committed by the defendant to satisfy the _actus reus._

For example, the conduct required for blackmail in **s21 Theft Act 1968** is that the defendant makes a demand with menaces. It is not necessary that the victim gives into the demand or that anything happens as a result of the demand.

### Result Offences

The _actus reus_ of result crimes requires more than just the defendant's action. Here, the action must lead to a specified consequence. In such cases, it must be proved that the action actually caused the result.

Result crimes include murder, manslaughter, criminal damage and assault occasioning bodily harm. [[Criminal Law/Causation]] is part of the actus reus of these offences.

### Circumstances

The _actus reus_ can also include the need for some particular surrounding circumstance.

Under the **Theft Act 1968, s 1(1)**, the _actus reus_ of theft is defined as the appropriation of property 'belonging to another'. The surrounding circumstance the prosecution must prove is that the property belonged to someone other than the thief.

### Omissions

A defendant can be held to have committed the _actus reus_ of an offence despite taking no action at all. Although the general rule that there is no liability for failure to act, the criminal law will, in certain circumstances, impose a legal obligation to act which if breached could result in criminal liability.

An on duty lifeguard could be liable for gross negligence manslaughter if a swimmer drowned due to a failure to take any action to help.

See [[omissions]].

## Identifying Actus Reus

```ad-example
The Criminal Damage Act 1971, s 1(1) states:

> 'A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.'

Here the actus reus is damage or destruction of property belonging to another without lawful excuse.
```

```ad-example
The Theft Act 1968, s 1(1) states:

> ‘A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.’

Here the actus reus is appropriation of property belonging to another.
```
