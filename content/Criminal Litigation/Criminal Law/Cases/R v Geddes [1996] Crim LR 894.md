# R v Geddes [1996] Crim LR 894

G, aged 29, appealed against conviction for attempted false imprisonment under the [Criminal Attempts Act 1981 s.1(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BAEAA40E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ec73431b31b148b391487232842869f0&contextData=(sc.Default)) after he was found in a school toilet, and on running away, discarded a rucksack containing a knife, string and sealing tape. He argued that an offence under s.1 was not made out as his actions were not more than merely preparatory to the commission of an offence.

Held, allowing the appeal, that although there was no clear delineation between acts amounting to an attempt and those which were merely preparatory, each case depended upon its facts and a s.1 offence required evidence that a defendant had moved from the stage of planning and preparation to implementing his intention. Whereas G clearly had the intention to commit false imprisonment he had not made any contact with pupils and had gone no further than the preparatory stages of an offence.
