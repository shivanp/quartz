# R v Asmelash [2013] EWCA Crim 157

## Summary

The voluntary consumption of alcohol did not form part of the circumstances for consideration under the [Coroners and Justice Act 2009 s.54(1)(c)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF0224CD1DA4211DE9AD491096115908F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=246008389fa14857af167043e168aa37&contextData=(sc.Default)), as amplified by [s.54(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF0224CD1DA4211DE9AD491096115908F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=246008389fa14857af167043e168aa37&contextData=(sc.Default)), in the context of the partial defence of loss of control.

## Abstract

The appellant (X) appealed against his conviction for murder.

X had stabbed the victim (V) in the chest, penetrating his heart and lung. X and V lived in the same house and often used to drink together. Both were intoxicated at the time of the attack. X gave evidence to the effect that V had been aggressive and physically abusive towards him, and he had swung out at him with a knife because he was frightened. He claimed that he had not deliberately chosen to stab V in the chest, but that V had made him so angry that he could not control himself. In addressing the loss of control defence, the judge directed the jury to consider whether they were sure that a person of X's sex and age with a normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint and in the same circumstances, but unaffected by alcohol, would not have reacted in the same or similar way.

X argued that, assuming the provisions of the [Coroners and Justice Act 2009 s.54(1)(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF0224CD1DA4211DE9AD491096115908F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=246008389fa14857af167043e168aa37&contextData=(sc.Default)) and [s.54(1)(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF0224CD1DA4211DE9AD491096115908F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=246008389fa14857af167043e168aa37&contextData=(sc.Default)) were engaged, the fact that he was drunk at the material time was one of his "circumstances" that had to be considered in accordance with [s.54(1)(c)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF0224CD1DA4211DE9AD491096115908F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=246008389fa14857af167043e168aa37&contextData=(sc.Default)): he should not be precluded from advancing the partial defence of loss of control simply because, entirely coincidentally, he happened to be intoxicated. The Crown argued that, in the absence of any express provision to the effect contended for by X, the court should proceed on the basis that the law was unchanged; furthermore, the issue of self-induced intoxication had already been considered by the instant court in the context of newly enacted provisions relating to diminished responsibility in _[R. v Dowds (Stephen Andrew) [2012] EWCA Crim 281, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 2576, [2012] 2 WLUK 629](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IADAD59D05DAD11E189F9F8850023C094/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=246008389fa14857af167043e168aa37&contextData=(sc.Default))_, and in that context, the defence could not be founded on voluntary intoxication, even if acute.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The judge had been right to direct the jury as he did. It had long been understood that the consumption of alcohol or drugs might diminish the ability of an individual to control or restrain himself, so that a person affected by drink or drugs might behave in a way in which he would not have behaved when sober or drug-free.

Although it might sometimes impact on the question whether the constituent elements of a crime, in particular in relation to the required intent, had been proved, self-induced intoxication did not provide a defence to a criminal charge. X's submission proceeded on the basis that in the absence of any express statutory provision, in the context of "loss of control", a new approach to the issue of voluntary drunkenness was required. That proposition could not be accepted. There was nothing in the loss of control defence to suggest that Parliament intended somehow that the normal rules which applied to voluntary intoxication should not apply. If that had been Parliament's intention, it would have been spelled out in unequivocal language.

Moreover, in the light of the compelling reasoning of the court in Dowds in the context of diminished responsibility, it was inconceivable that different criteria should govern the approach to the issue of voluntary drunkenness depending on whether the partial defence under consideration was diminished responsibility or loss of control, Dowds applied. In some cases, both defences would be canvassed before the jury, and the potential for uncertainty and confusion which would follow the necessarily very different directions on the issue of intoxication depending on which partial defence was under consideration did not bear contemplation (see paras [22-24, 26](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) That conclusion did not mean that a defendant who had been drinking was deprived of any possible loss of control defence. It simply meant that the loss of control defence had to be approached without reference to the defendant's voluntary intoxication. If a sober person in the defendant's circumstances, with normal levels of tolerance and self-restraint, might have behaved in the same way as the defendant confronted by the relevant qualifying trigger, the defendant would not be deprived of the loss of control defence just because he was not sober. Different considerations would arise if a defendant had a severe problem with alcohol or drugs and was mercilessly taunted about the condition, to the extent that it constituted a qualifying trigger: the alcohol or drug problem would then form part of the circumstances for consideration (para.[25](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
