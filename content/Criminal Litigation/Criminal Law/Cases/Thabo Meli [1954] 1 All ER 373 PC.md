# Thabo Meli [1954] 1 All ER 373 PC

FACTS: The appellants hit V over the head with intent to kill him. Thinking that they had killed him, they rolled his body over the cliff to make his death appear accidental. It was later discovered that V died from exposure at the foot of the cliff.

HELD: The appellants had the _mens rea_ for murder when they hit V, but not when they did the act that caused his death, as they thought he was already dead at this point. The Privy Council said that because the appellants' acts were performed in pursuance of an antecedent plan to kill the victim, the series of acts could not be divided up. They formed one transaction and it was enough that the _mens rea_ existed at some point during that transaction.
