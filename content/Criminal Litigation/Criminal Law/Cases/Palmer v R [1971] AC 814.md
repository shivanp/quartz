# Palmer v R [1971] AC 814

When the defence of self-defence is raised to a charge of murder, it is not automatically necessary for the judge to direct the jury that, if they consider excessive force has been used in self-defence, they should return a verdict of manslaughter; everything depends on the particular facts and circumstances. P and I were separately convicted before the Supreme Court of Jamaica of murder and sentenced to death. In both cases the trial judge referred to the defence of self-defence but indicated only two possible verdicts, guilty or not guilty of murder.

Held, all that was needed in the summing up was a clear exposition of the conception of necessary self-defence in relation to the particular facts of the case. (Decision of Court of Appeal of Jamaica affirmed).
