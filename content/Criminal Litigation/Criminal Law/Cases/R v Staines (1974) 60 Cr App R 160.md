# R v Staines (1974) 60 Cr App R 160

A deception, in order to be "reckless" within s.15(4) of the Theft Act 1968, must be more than merely careless or negligent; there must be an indifference as to whether a statement is true or false.

A and B went shopping. In each of two shops A wrote out cheques for purchases on cheques belonging to, and signed by, B. A wrote out a different address on the back of each cheque; neither was her own address although one had been the address of B. The account had been closed and both cheques were dishonoured. A was charged with two offences of obtaining property by deception. She claimed that she had signed the cheques because B's hand was in bandages, and that throughout she had acted honestly, having no reason to believe that the cheques would not be met. The trial judge commented that A's defence was an almost impossible one to maintain without calling B, although the defence did not have to call anyone, nor prove anything. A was convicted.

It was held, dismissing the appeal, that "reckless" must be given the meaning "without caring." The judge's direction included no definition of "recklessness," but in its ordinary meaning it would convey to the jury something more than mere carelessness. The judge's comment on B's absence was perfectly proper, and both arguments in support of the appeal failed.
