# R v Steer [1988] 1 AC 111 (HL)

FACTS: The defendant had fired three shots through a window.

HELD: This did not constitute the offence under the CDA 1971, s 1(2) because any risk to life intended or foreseen had been by the bullets fired and not by the damaged property. It was held that there had to be a causal link between the damage to property and the danger to life.

If the damage is caused by fire, the risk to life will always be from the damaged property. Lord Bridge of Harwich pointed out in R v Steer:

> ‘It is not the match and the inflammable materials, the flaming firebrand or any other inflammatory agent which the arsonist uses to start the fire which causes danger to life, it is the ensuing conflagration which occurs as the property which has been set on fire is damaged or destroyed. When [whether] the victim in the bedroom is overcome by the smoke or incinerated by the flames as the building burns, it would be absurd to say that this does not result from the damage to the building.’

Intention or recklessness in the [Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.1(2)(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I07FFEF90E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=967e4d67d2a74764913a97677ae5b8fd&contextData=(sc.DocLink)) is directed to dangers to life caused by the damaged property and not by the way in which it is damaged. S, after a disagreement with his business partner, went to his partner's bungalow and fired shots from a rifle at two windows and the door. No injuries were caused. S was charged with damaging property with intent, being reckless as to whether life would be endangered, contrary to s.1(2) of the 1971 Act. The trial judge rejected a submission of no case, whereupon S pleaded guilty and appealed against conviction. The Court of Appeal upheld the appeal and the Crown appealed.

Held, dismissing the Crown's appeal, that the section was directed at danger to life caused by the damaged property not by the way in which it was damaged (dictum of Parker L.J. in R. v Hardie [1985] C.L.Y. 692 distinguished).
