# R v Singh [1999] Crim LR 582

S was the son of the owner of a building split into bedsits. S acted as rent collector, maintenance man and main link between the tenants and his father. At the time of the death, he was in charge as his father was in India. Several tenants told him of problems with their gas fires, including the smell of gas and symptoms suggestive of carbon monoxide poisoning over a period of 4 months. S acknowledged he was aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning. One of the tenants died of carbon monoxide poisoning. S, his father and the fitter who inspected the fires the previous year were all convicted of manslaughter. Given the number of complaints, his direct involvement and his knowledge, S's conviction was upheld.

The deceased tenant had died from carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of a faulty gas fire. The defendant was the maintenance man for the lodging house where the deceased had been staying and he was in charge of the lodging house while his father, the owner, was away in India. The trial judge summed up the duty of care owed in the case:

'In [the defendant's] case there existed a close relationship between him and his father’s tenants … Mr Gurpal Singh was … the "maintenance man" he was also one of the two people to whom tenants could bring any complaints or inquiries that they had with the prospect of there being dealt with … Therefore Mr Gurpal Singh had assumed a duty of care towards his father’s tenants.'

The Court of Appeal approved 'as a model of its kind' the judge’s direction and the appeal against conviction was dismissed.

## Summary

In considering whether S, a manager of a lodging house owned by his father could be found liable in negligence following the death of a tenant caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty gas fire, the court had to look to the totality of the situation to assess whether S owed the tenant a duty of care rather than examining any separate capacities in which S had acted.

## Abstract

S, the manager of a lodging house owned by his father, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, following the death by carbon monoxide poisoning of a man who had rented a room fitted with a faulty gas fire. S, who acted as rent collector, maintenance man and the person to whom tenants directed their complaints, appealed against his conviction on the basis that, after separating the various capacities in which he acted in relation to the premises, no duty of care arose as regards any one of those capacities in the absence of all other parts.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that, when considering whether a duty of care existed, the court had to look to the totality of the situation rather than examining any separate capacities in which a defendant acted. Furthermore, it was unhelpful, when examining the issue of proximity, to give any great consideration to the phrase "assumption of responsibility" which could be misleading. In the instant case, the tenants of the lodging house were led to believe that S and his father would take care to ensure that they were not poisoned by the equipment in the premises and S, whilst perhaps not in a position himself to ascertain how the danger arose, was responsible for taking reasonable steps to control the danger by calling on the advice of experts. The judge, therefore, correctly found a sufficient degree of proximity between the tenants and S such that a duty of care was owed by S.
