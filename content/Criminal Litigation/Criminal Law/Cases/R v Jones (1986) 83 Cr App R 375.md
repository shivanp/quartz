# R v Jones (1986) 83 Cr App R 375

Some boys at a youth club tossed two other boys into the air, resulting in one suffering a ruptured spleen and the other a broken arm. The Court of Appeal held that they ought to have been allowed to raise the issue of consent to injuries sustained through ‘rough and undisciplined’ horseplay, for the jury to then consider.
