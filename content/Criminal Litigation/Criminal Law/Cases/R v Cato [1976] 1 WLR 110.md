# R v Cato [1976] 1 WLR 110

Heroin is a noxious thing. The prosecution must prove that its injection was a cause of death and not merely de minimis. Consent to its injection is not a defence. D injected F with heroin. F died, the cause of death being that his respiratory system ceased to function as a result of intoxication from drugs. D was convicted of manslaughter and of administering a noxious thing, contrary to the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BFCDC30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f3e54828b1cb4a34bd9c279a5a0b7d88&contextData=(sc.Default)) .

Held, dismissing D's appeal,

(1) that the prosecution had to prove that the injection of heroin was a cause of death and not de minimis;

(2) although F's consent to the injection of heroin might be relevant to consideration of whether D had acted with recklessness or gross negligence, the victim's consent was not generally a defence to a charge of manslaughter;

(3) the use of heroin was potentially harmful and therefore it was a "noxious" thing for the purposes of s.23.
