# R v Hill and Hall (1998) 89 Cr App R 74

FACTS: The accused, a nuclear protestor, was arrested outside a nuclear submarine base. She was in possession of a hacksaw blade, which she intended to use to cut through the wire. She was charged under the CDA 1971, s 3 (possessing anything with intent to destroy or damage property) and unsuccessfully raised the defence under the CDA 1971, s 5(2)(b) that she was acting in order to persuade the Americans to leave the base, to reduce the threat of a nuclear strike, and thus protect her property.

HELD: The objective test in Hunt was confirmed in this case. The court held that cutting the wire was far too remote from the eventual aim of protecting property to satisfy the test.
