# Idrees v DPP [2011] EWHC 624

Idrees had failed his driving theory test 15 times. An unknown person then took the test pretending to be Idrees and passed. There was good evidence that Idrees had arranged this: Idrees had booked the test slot and he had booked it in English despite having taken the previous 15 tests in Urdu.

It was found that the person who took the test made a false representation by conduct that he was Idrees, and he did this as Idrees’s agent. The magistrates’ court convicted Idrees of fraud by false representation and the High Court upheld the conviction.

## Summary

A magistrates' court was correct to find that there was sufficient evidence to convict an individual of the offence of fraud where there was overwhelming evidence that he had had another impersonate him for the purposes of sitting a theory driving test.

## Abstract

The appellant (X) appealed by way of case stated against a decision of a magistrates' court rejecting his submission of no case to answer.

X had been accused of fraud contrary to the [Fraud Act 2006 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA5E42E00753611DB8071C6D7F7AFDBBF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=87a90a467e87488a961873114d5011e7&contextData=(sc.Default)) and [s.2.](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID484AE61754511DB8071C6D7F7AFDBBF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=87a90a467e87488a961873114d5011e7&contextData=(sc.Default)) It was alleged that he had made a false representation, namely that an unknown person had impersonated him for the purpose of sitting a theory driving test on his behalf. X had tried on 15 occasions to pass his theory test, and each time he had opted to sit the test in Urdu. A person (Y) appeared at the test centre with a driving licence in X's name. Y was known in theory test centres and when he was spotted he left, leaving behind X's driving licence. The test had been booked online using the credit card of a person who was never traced, and English had been selected as the appropriate language for the test. In addition, a confirmation letter had been sent to X giving the date and time of the test. Three days after the incident, X reported the theft of his driving licence. X maintained that as he had failed his theory test 15 times, it was possible that someone had out of sympathy for him sought to impersonate him. X argued that there was insufficient evidence of a connection with Y to properly convict and that there was no case to answer. That was rejected by the magistrates' court. The issue on appeal was whether there had been sufficient evidence to convict X.
