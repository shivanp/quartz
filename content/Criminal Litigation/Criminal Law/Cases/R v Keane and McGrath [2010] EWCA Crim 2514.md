# R v Keane and McGrath [2010] EWCA Crim 2514

## Summary

The court set out the law on self-defence and gave guidance as to the correct approach to the summing up of cases where the defendant was himself the original aggressor.

## Abstract

The appellants (K and M) appealed against their respective convictions for inflicting grievous bodily harm and manslaughter.

Both appeals raised questions relating to the summing up of cases where self-defence was in issue. The issue in K's case was the extent to which self-defence was available to a defendant who was himself the original aggressor, particularly where it was suggested that he deliberately provoked violence from his antagonist. One of the issues in M's case was the judge's introduction into his summing up of the possibility of mistaken belief as to what was happening.

## Held

Appeals dismissed.

(1) The [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 s.76](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1F307450261911DDA4CACD152F86E460/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=93645e954d6a4e4e8d6e79514d13bff3&contextData=(sc.Default)) did not alter the law as it had stood for many years. It was not an exhaustive statement of the law of self-defence, but it did state the basic principles. There was no requirement for a summing up to rehearse the whole of the contents of s.76: the fundamental rule of summing up remained the same, namely that the jury had to be told the law which applied to the facts which it might find, and was not to be troubled by a disquisition on the parts of the law which did not affect the case (see para.[6](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) It was not the law that where a defendant had either started the fight with the victim, or entered it willingly, that would always and inevitably be a bar to self-defence arising, _[Burns (Craig John) v HM Advocate (Self Defence) 1995 J.C. 154, [1995] 5 WLUK 297](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7F8CEAD0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=93645e954d6a4e4e8d6e79514d13bff3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. Self-defence could arise in the case of the original aggressor, but only where the violence offered by the victim was so out of proportion to what the original aggressor did that the roles were effectively reversed, _[R. v Balogun (Adebukola) [1999] 7 WLUK 644](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3C35E2A0E62F11DF8192A9A67A5DF705/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=93645e954d6a4e4e8d6e79514d13bff3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Rashford (Nicholas) [2005] EWCA Crim 3377, [2006] Crim. L.R. 547, [2005] 12 WLUK 352](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I61649F21E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=93645e954d6a4e4e8d6e79514d13bff3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The recent case of _[R. v Harvey (Nadia Anne) [2009] EWCA Crim 469, [2009] 3 WLUK 471](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I56A9C870150911DEBC0589FA09171FC8/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=93645e954d6a4e4e8d6e79514d13bff3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was a useful example of the proper approach to cases when self-defence arose. The judge invited the jury to consider whether "the tables had been turned": that expression would be suitable for a great many cases, as long as it was borne in mind that it would not be enough to bring self-defence into issue that a defendant who started the fight was at some point during the fight getting the worst of it, merely because the victim was defending himself reasonably, Harvey applied. It was not the law that if a defendant set out to provoke another to punch him, and succeeded, then the defendant was entitled to punch the other person. Underlying the law of self-defence was the commonsense morality that what was not unlawful was force which was reasonably necessary (paras [17-19](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) Juries should, where necessary, be given some help about the way the law worked when applied to the competing versions of the facts which they had to consider (paras [20, 22](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) The discussion relating to self-defence in the March 2010 Judicial Studies Board Bench Book began with the question whether the defendant honestly believed that he needed to defend himself. Although that would often be a convenient starting point, it perhaps should not be treated as universal. There would be a large number of cases in which no question of mistaken belief arose, and in those cases to ask the jury if the defendant believed he was under attack might divert them from the real question, namely whether they were sure that he was not under attack in fact (para.[39](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). (5) The summing up in K's case was not flawed: the judge's direction that self-defence was not available if K was the aggressor or successfully provoked a fight sufficiently on the facts of the case identified the issue for the jury. In M's case, the introduction of the possibility of mistaken belief was an unnecessary complication, but it was not in any way damaging to M. Both convictions were safe.
