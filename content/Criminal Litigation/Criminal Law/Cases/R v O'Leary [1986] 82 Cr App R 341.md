# R v O'Leary [1986] 82 Cr App R 341

FACTS: Here, the appellant forced entry into a private house while unarmed. He then picked up a knife from the kitchen and went upstairs where he confronted the two occupants. He committed a theft and injured the occupants. In answer to a charge of **section 9(1)(b)** aggravated burglary, the appellant claimed he could not be guilty because he was not armed when he entered the house.

HELD: However, the Court of Appeal held that the time when he must have the weapon of offence was the time at which he actually stole. In this case, that was when he confronted the householders and demanded their cash.
