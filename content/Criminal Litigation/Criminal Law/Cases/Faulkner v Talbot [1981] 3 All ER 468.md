# Faulkner v Talbot [1981] 3 All ER 468

Lord Lane CJ defined unlawful physical force as

> "Any intentional [or reckless] touching of another person without the consent of that person and without lawful excuse. It need not necessarily be hostile, rude, or aggressive.‚Äù

The sexual touching by a woman of a boy under 16, even as part of sexual intercourse and with his consent is an offence. A 14 year-old boy was staying at the appellants' home, and was invited by the appellant to join her in bed. The appellant tried to hold the boy's penis but he would not let her. She then pulled the boy onto her, took hold of his penis and put it into her vagina; she was charged with indecent assault.

Held, that where a woman touches the penis of a boy under 16, even though as a preliminary to or during intercourse, she commits an offence notwithstanding the boy's consent.
