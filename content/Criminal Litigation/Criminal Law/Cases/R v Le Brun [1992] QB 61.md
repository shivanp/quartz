# R v Le Brun [1992] QB 61

D assaulted his wife, hitting her on the jaw and knocking her unconscious. He then attempted to drag her home, and in doing so he accidentally dropped her and she fractured her skull on the pavement. She died from the fracture to the skull. D was convicted of manslaughter and the conviction was upheld. The court said that the unlawful act and the act causing death were all part of the 'same transaction'.

Lord Lane stated that it did not matter that there was no preconceived plan and that the defendant knew that his wife was still alive. He said that the transaction continued as long as the defendant was trying to cover up the crime he believed he had committed.
