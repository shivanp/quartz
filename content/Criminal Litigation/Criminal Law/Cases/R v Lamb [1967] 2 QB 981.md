# R v Lamb [1967] 2 QB 981

The defendant pointed a revolver at the victim as a practical joke. Both parties believed that there was no risk of the revolver firing a bullet. Unfortunately, a bullet was fired and the victim was killed. Lamb was convicted of manslaughter.

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal against conviction on the basis that there had not been an unlawful act. The defendant had no intention of committing an assault (at that time, intention was the only mens rea for assault) and therefore all elements of the offence had not been proven.

FACTS: Two teenage boys were playing with a revolver. This had two bullets in it, neither of which was opposite the barrel. Believing that this meant the gun was safe, the defendant pointed it at his friend and pulled the trigger. His friend was shot dead.

HELD: No assault had taken place, since the victim at whom the gun was pointed did not fear the possible infliction of violence because he did not believe the gun, with which they were playing, would fire. Note there was also no assault because the defendant did not have the necessary _mens rea._
