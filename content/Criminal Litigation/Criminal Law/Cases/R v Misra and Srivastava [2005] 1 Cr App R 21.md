# R v Misra and Srivastava [2005] 1 Cr App R 21

The victim developed an infection following a routine operation. The two defendants were between them the doctors responsible for Vâ€™s post operative care over a period of 48 hours from the time of his operation until the time of death (S on night shift, M on days). Despite numerous signs of significant post operative problems (raised temperature, low blood pressure, high pulse) they took little action. They did not check blood tests that had been ordered, ignored advice from senior nurses and other doctors, recorded the patient as being fine and basically did nothing to treat the patient. Such a catalogue of errors could not realistically be anything other than grossly negligent.

## Summary

To establish the criminal offence of manslaughter by gross negligence, the negligence had to be so gross that if all the other ingredients of the offence were proved, it amounted to a crime and was punishable as such. The question for the jury was whether the behaviour was grossly negligent and consequently criminal, which was a question of fact. There was no unacceptable uncertainty about the offence.

## Abstract

The appellant doctors (M) and (S) appealed against convictions for manslaughter by gross negligence. The trial judge had certified a question as to whether the crime of gross negligence manslaughter was compliant with the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.7](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7e25f059002d478f9f216d0a7aba181c&contextData=(sc.Default)). The deceased had undergone surgery to repair his patella tendon but became infected with staphylococcus aureus. The condition was untreated. There was a gradual build up of poison within his body, which culminated in toxic shock syndrome from which he died. The appellants were senior house officers involved in the post operative care of the deceased. The Crown had relied on the appellants' failure to appreciate that their patient was seriously ill. M submitted that manslaughter by gross negligence was an offence which lacked certainty.

Held, dismissing the appeals, that the law was clear. The ingredients of the offence had been clearly defined, and the principles outlined in _[R. v Adomako (John Asare) [1995] 1 A.C. 171, [1994] 6 WLUK 393](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2ED0EDC0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7e25f059002d478f9f216d0a7aba181c&contextData=(sc.Default))_. They involved no uncertainty. The hypothetical citizen, seeking to know his position, would be advised that, assuming he owed a duty of care to the deceased which he had negligently broken, and that death had resulted, he would be liable to conviction for manslaughter if, on the available evidence, the jury was satisfied that his negligence was gross. A doctor would be told that grossly negligent treatment which exposed a patient to the risk of death, and caused it, would constitute manslaughter. There was no uncertainty to offend against Art.7. Gross negligence manslaughter was not incompatible with the 1998 Act, Adomako applied.
