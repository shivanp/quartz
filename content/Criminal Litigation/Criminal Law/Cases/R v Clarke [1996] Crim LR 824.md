# R v Clarke [1996] Crim LR 824

Clarke, a private investigator, falsely told a group of potential clients that he was a former fraud squad officer and a court bailiff. As a result of those representations, he had been engaged to trace funds of a group of victims of fraud. He was charged under the **Theft Act 1968, s 16** (now repealed). The judge directed the jury that he was dishonest if he made these deceptions.

Clarke's case was that he believed he was able to do the work well, so was not dishonest. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal. The interpretation of the trial judge's indication was that he thought it was necessarily dishonest to tell lies to obtain employment, irrespective of whether or not the liar thought he could do the job properly and intended to do so. Parliament had included in the offence the requirement of dishonesty as well as the requirement for a deception. Therefore there should have been a direction on dishonesty.
