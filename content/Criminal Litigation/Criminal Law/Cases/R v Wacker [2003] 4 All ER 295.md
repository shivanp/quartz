# R v Wacker [2003] 4 All ER 295

The appellant, a lorry driver, was convicted of killing by gross negligence after 58 illegal immigrants were suffocated while being transported in his lorry. The defendant argued that the law of negligence did not recognise a duty of care arising between parties to a criminal enterprise.

The Court of Appeal upheld his conviction stating that it was inappropriate to apply the tortious principle of _ex turpi causa non oritur actio_ in a criminal action.

## Abstract

W, a Dutch driver, appealed against his conviction for the manslaughter of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants concealed in the back of his goods lorry who suffocated after he closed off the only ventilation point. The Attorney General referred as unduly lenient concurrent sentences of imprisonment of six years each for the 58 counts of manslaughter imposed consecutively to a sentence of eight years for conspiracy to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. W submitted that (1) he had not owed the immigrants a duty of care because they had shared the same joint legal purpose. He contended that one of the principles of the law of negligence, ex turpi causa non oritur actio, was that it did not recognise the relationship between those involved in a criminal enterprise as giving rise to a duty of care between the parties, and (2) given that the allegation was of an omission or failure on his part to open the air vent, the relevant time at which the "duty" arose could not be ascertained anyway. The Attorney General did not dispute the total sentence of 14 years' imprisonment but contended that imposing six years' imprisonment for manslaughter in contrast to the eight years received for conspiracy sent an unacceptable message that evading immigration was a more serious matter than causing the death of 58 people.

Held, allowing both the appeal and the reference, that

(1) as a matter of public policy there was no reason why the criminal law would refuse to hold a person criminally responsible for the death of another simply because they had been engaged in a joint unlawful activity at the time. There was no authority which countered this view. W had assumed a duty of care to the immigrants. He knew that nobody's actions but his own could prevent the immigrants from suffocating to death and that if he failed to act reasonably in fulfilling the duty to an extent to be considered criminal, he was guilty of manslaughter if the immigrants died, and

(2) the duty of care arose at the time the ventilation was shut off and continued until it was opened again. The sentence for manslaughter was unduly lenient and was increased to 14 years' imprisonment; however the sentence for conspiracy was made concurrent, leaving the total sentence unaffected.
