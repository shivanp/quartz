# R v Press and Thompson [2013] EWCA Crim 1849

## Summary

Convictions for both causing and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent were safe where a judge had not misdirected or failed to direct a jury appropriately in relation to certain issues.

## Abstract

The appellants (P and T) appealed against their convictions for both causing and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

CCTV footage showed the alleged victims (V) on the ground attempting to protect themselves while P and T punched and kicked them. T was arrested at the scene but P escaped. T asserted in interview that he had gone to the scene of the incident alone, that he did not know the man seen in the CCTV with him, namely P, and that he had felt threatened but did not think that he had taken any action against those threatening him. T later gave evidence and admitted that he was tipsy at the time of the incident. P pleaded guilty to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to one of V with intent. At trial, the Crown relied on the fact that T had lied about not knowing P. A doctor gave evidence that T was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the time of the incident, and therefore had a heightened awareness of potential threats, and that differences between T's account in interview and in evidence might be explained by the fact that a head injury T sustained during the incident had caused him to suffer short-term memory loss. The judge said that he had to give the jury a careful direction about the significance they could attach to any lies they found proved, including that fact that T said that he did not think that he had taken any action against V. He proceeded to make a Lucas direction. He also made a good character direction, but reminded the jury that they would have to consider the impact of T's lies, if proved. He also gave a direction as to the necessary intent to prove joint enterprise grievous bodily harm. P and T were convicted of both offences.

They argued that the judge (1) misdirected the jury on the issue of T's lies in interview; (2) misdirected the jury on the facts when summing up; (3) erred in making a qualified good character direction in respect of T; (4) was biased against the doctor; (5) gave his direction on the necessary intent to prove joint enterprise in a way that was incomprehensible to the jury; (6) did not direct the jury as to the effect of intoxication and/or PTSD on intent; (7) did not appropriately direct the jury on the relevance of the evidence of T's PTSD to the availability of a defence of self-defence.

## Held

Appeals dismissed.

(1) T's assertion that he did not think that he had taken any action against V was so obviously a subject for the jury's examination, having regard to what they could see on the CCTV footage, that T was not placed at any disadvantage by the judge's inclusion of that matter in his Lucas direction. Indeed, he could have been criticised for not doing so. It had not impacted on the safety of the verdict. The real issue between the Crown and the defence was whether the differences between T's accounts in interview and in evidence could be accounted for by his head injury and a short-term memory loss or any other reason, and the judge had appropriately directed the jury as to how they should approach those differences (see para.[18](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The judge's summary of the evidence was not inaccurate, and if it was in any respect, it was of no consequence and had not resulted in any unfairness to P or T (paras [19-22](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) No unfairness resulted from the way in which the judge gave his good character direction. The jury would have understood that good character spoke in P and T's favour, but that when it came to the value of that good character, T's credibility as a witness might be affected by their decision as to whether he had lied in interview (para.[24](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) The judge was not biased. Rather, in questioning the doctor, he was testing the limits of his opinion as to the effect PTSD might have had on T's appreciation of the circumstances. The judge was entitled to raise the issue with the expert as he had (para.[27](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(5) The judge's direction on the necessary intent to prove joint enterprise was not couched in terms which the jury was misunderstanding. He was dealing with a situation in which the jury might not be sure that there was a joint enterprise from the outset to cause really serious harm, and he gave the appropriate direction accordingly. It could also not be said that the jury had been misled by his direction on the basis on which they could convict P of causing grievous bodily harm with intent (paras [31, 47](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(6) The judge's direction on the effect of T's intoxication on establishing intent was adequate, despite not being given in the conventional form. He had correctly informed the jury that, even if T's intention was formed in drink, it was nevertheless an intention (paras [34-35](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(7) The judge made it clear that it was for the jury, not T, to decide whether the degree of force used by T was reasonable. In those circumstances, there was no misdirection on self-defence. The jury must have been well aware of the evidence of T's PTSD and the effect that that would have had on his perception of an alleged threat by V before concluding that T harboured the necessary intent. It was unnecessary for the judge to make any further direction (paras [44-45](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
