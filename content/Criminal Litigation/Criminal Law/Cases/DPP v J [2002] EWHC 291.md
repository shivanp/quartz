# DPP v J [2002] EWHC 291

FACTS: The defendants had accosted a boy on his way home from school. One of them snatched the boy's headphones, and another defendant snapped them in two.

HELD: Silber J noted that once the headphones had been snapped, they were useless and could be said to have been dealt with definitely, to have been got rid of, or finished under the dictionary definition given in **_R v Cahill_**_._ He said that the intention of the defendants has to be inferred from their acts, thus this defendant had demonstrated an intention to treat the headphones as his own to dispose of regardless of the owner's rights.

## Summary

The defendants, who had been charged with robbery after snatching a pair of headphones from their owner, snapping them and then returning them to the owner, had had the "intention of permanently depriving" the owner of them for the purposes of the Theft Act 1968 s.6(1).

## Abstract

The DPP appealed against the decision of the justices that S, P and R, who had been charged with robbery, had no case to answer. The charges had arisen from an incident in which one of the three defendants had taken a pair of stereo headphones from their owner and had given them to one of the other defendants, who had snapped them. The headphones had subsequently been thrown to the ground. The justices had found that there had been no intention for the purposes of the [Theft Act 1968 s.6(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=634aaa557c0642b4950381cb6b552361&contextData=(sc.Default)) to permanently deprive the owner of his headphones.

Held, allowing the appeal, that in snatching the headphones and then rendering them useless by snapping them the defendants had demonstrated an intention to treat them as their own and to "dispose of" them regardless of the rights of their owner, _[R. v Cahill [1993] Crim. L.R. 141, [1992] 8 WLUK 92](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I84D242B0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=634aaa557c0642b4950381cb6b552361&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Fernandes (Roland Anthony) [1996] 1 Cr. App. R. 175, [1995] 4 WLUK 199](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I437E5AF0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=634aaa557c0642b4950381cb6b552361&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. There was no requirement that goods had to be "completely exhausted" before they could be disposed of for the purposes of s.6(1) of the Act. It followed that the justices had erred in concluding that there was no case to answer in regard to the intention to permanently deprive. Moreover, it was apparent that the justices had applied the wrong test when dealing with the submission of no case to answer; it had only been necessary for them to determine whether there was any evidence to prove an essential element of the alleged offence, _[Practice Direction (Submission of No Case) [1962] 1 W.L.R. 227, [1962] 2 WLUK 34](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I281599E0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=634aaa557c0642b4950381cb6b552361&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
