# R v Calhaem [1985] QB 808

The word "counsel" in the [Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 s.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C834A40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e1775acc4fdf4f4b8a6a33ae053393d0&contextData=(sc.Default)) does not imply any causal connection between the counselling and the principal offence. C was indicted for murder under Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 s.8. It was alleged that she had counselled Z to murder the victim. Z pleaded guilty to murder and gave unchallenged evidence for the Crown at C's trial that he had decided not to kill the victim but had gone berserk and had killed her. The jury was directed that to "counsel" meant to incite, solicit, instruct or authorise, or to put somebody up to something, and that the Crown had to prove that C counselled Z in that sense to kill the victim, that the victim was killed by Z in circumstances that amounted to murder, and that such killing was within the scope of the instruction or authorisation. C was convicted.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that on the true construction of the Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 s.8 "counsel" had no implication of any causal connection between the counselling and the principal offence; the natural meaning of the word did not imply the commission of the offence; the offence was established if there was counselling and the principal offence was committed by the person counselled acting within the scope of his authority and not by accident.
