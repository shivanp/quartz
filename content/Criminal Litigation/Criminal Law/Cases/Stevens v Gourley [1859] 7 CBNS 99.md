# Stevens v Gourley [1859] 7 CBNS 99

The English Court held that a structure of wood, of considerable size, 16 feet by 13, and intended to be permanently used as a shop, was a 'building' within the Metropolitan Building Act 1855, although not let into the ground, but merely laid upon timbers upon the surface. A contract for the erection of a building in contravention of the Act could not be enforced.
