# R v Poulton (1832) 5 C & P

Littledale J made it clear that the child must be fully expelled from the mother’s body and born alive:

> ‘… the being born must mean that the whole body is brought into the world; and it is not sufficient that the child expires in the progress of the birth. Whether the child was born alive or not depends mainly upon the evidence of the medical men.'
