# R v Blaue [1975] 1 WLR 1411

FACTS: Blaue stabbed a woman several times and pierced her lung. The victim refused to have a blood transfusion, as it was contrary to her religious beliefs. She was advised that without a transfusion she would die. She refused to have the transfusion and subsequently died. The defendant was convicted of manslaughter. He appealed against his conviction, arguing that the victim's refusal to have a blood transfusion amounted to a _novus actus interveniens_.

HELD: This argument was rejected. Defendants must take their victims as they find them and that meant the whole person, in both mind and body.
