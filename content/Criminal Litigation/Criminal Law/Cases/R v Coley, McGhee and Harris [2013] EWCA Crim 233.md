# R v Coley, McGhee and Harris [2013] EWCA Crim 233

## Summary

The court considered the issues of insanity, automatism and voluntary intoxication in a case of attempted murder, one of wounding with intent and one of aggravated arson.

## Abstract

The first appellant (C) appealed against his conviction and sentence for attempted murder, the second appellant (M) appealed against his conviction for wounding with intent, and the third appellant (H) appealed against his conviction for aggravated arson.

C was 17 when one night he got up, entered his neighbour's house and repeatedly stabbed his neighbour's partner. C was a heavy cannabis user and had smoked a lot that evening. C had no history of violence. He did not deny responsibility for the injuries, but asserted that he had "blacked out" and had no memory of the attack, and had no idea why he did it. The psychiatric evidence was that C had no underlying mental illness or personality disorder, but that there was a real possibility that he committed the attack during a brief psychotic episode triggered by cannabis.

The trial judge ruled that C's case was one of voluntary intoxication, not insanity, and he refused to leave to the jury the issues of insanity and automatism, so the issue for the jury was whether C had formed the intention to kill. It decided that he had.

M suffered from severe tinnitus. He took a prescription tranquiliser, temazepam, to help him sleep, but also resorted to drinking alcohol, despite the warning that with temazepam he should not. At about 4am one night, after drinking a lot, he went to an off-licence to buy more alcohol. He became aggressive and fought with another customer before leaving. He returned armed with a kitchen knife and stabbed one of the shop assistants in the arm while they fled. M could not remember any of those events. An expert in the action of drugs on the brain gave evidence that temazepam combined with alcohol could reduce social restraint and lead to disinhibited behaviour.

The trial judge rejected M's submission that he had no choice but to take alcohol to alleviate the symptoms of tinnitus and ruled that his intoxication was voluntary; he also ruled that there was no evidence that M was suffering from automatism. The jury found that M had intended to cause grievous bodily harm.

H had started a fire in his own house, and was charged with doing so being reckless as to whether the lives of others, namely his neighbours, would be endangered. He took medication for clinical depression, and he had a pattern of drinking heavily only during periods of leave from work. The cessation of those bouts had led to episodes of alcohol psychosis or alcohol-induced hallucinosis. At the time of the fire he was suffering such an episode; he was seen acting strangely, but he removed important documents from his house before starting the fire. He accepted that he had deliberately started the fire and that he knew it was wrong but said he had given no thought to the risk to others. In light of the judge's ruling that the jury had to consider H's recklessness as if he had not been drinking, he pleaded guilty.

C submitted that

(1) his was not a case of intoxication but rather had passed to a recognised condition of mental illness, namely a psychotic episode, no matter how transient, and therefore the judge should have left the issues of insanity and automatism to the jury. M submitted that

(2) the judge had been wrong to withdraw automatism from the jury. The Crown submitted in H's case that his mental illness was brought on by his past voluntary drinking and therefore should be treated in the same way as if he were drunk.

## Held

Judgment accordingly.

(1) The law had long recognised the distinction C identified between intoxication and a disease of the mind induced by intoxicants. Further, temporary insanity was as much insanity as that which was long-lasting or permanent, _[DPP v Beard [1920] A.C. 479, [1920] 3 WLUK 27](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AD41A20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa48e9788b94634b393cb8b0c4f91fe&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed. The possible state of mind in which C stabbed the victim could properly be called a mental abnormality. To speak of a psychotic episode was to speak of a temporary abnormality of the brain or mind and thus of a defect of reason for the purposes of the M'Naghten rules, _[R. v M'Naghten 8 E.R. 718, [1843] 6 WLUK 145](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2A245420E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa48e9788b94634b393cb8b0c4f91fe&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered.

However, whether there was a "disease of the mind" for the purpose of the M'Naghten rules had to be a question of law, not of medical usage. Insanity called for a special verdict of acquittal, while voluntary intoxication was generally no defence at all but might be relevant to whether the defendant formed a specific intention, if the offence in question required such, _[DPP v Majewski [1977] A.C. 443, [1976] 4 WLUK 71](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AF95560E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa48e9788b94634b393cb8b0c4f91fe&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. Regardless of precisely where the line fell between insanity and voluntary intoxication, C's case fell comfortably on the voluntary intoxication side.

In order to engage the law of insanity, it was not enough that there was an effect on the mind; there also had to be a disease of the mind. Direct, acute effects on the mind of intoxicants, voluntarily taken, were not so classified, _R. v Davis (1881) 14 Cox C.C. 563_ followed, _[R. v Quick (William George) [1973] Q.B. 910, [1973] 4 WLUK 81](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I61243AC0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa48e9788b94634b393cb8b0c4f91fe&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied. C's argument amounted to treating every defect of reason as a disease of the mind, but that was not the law (see paras [15-21](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

Automatism could be expressed as complete destruction of voluntary control, [Watmore v Jenkins [1962] 2 Q.B. 572, [1962] 6 WLUK 18](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF0B046C0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa48e9788b94634b393cb8b0c4f91fe&contextData=(sc.Search))_[Attorney General's Reference (No.2 of 1992) [1994] Q.B. 91, [1993] 5 WLUK 283](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6A1BB871E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa48e9788b94634b393cb8b0c4f91fe&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied. The psychiatric evidence about C was of voluntary, if irrational, action, which would preclude a defence of automatism. Further, that defence was not available to a defendant who had induced an acute state of involuntary behaviour by his own fault, Quick applied.

In addition, the trial judge had been right to hold that the possibility of automatism ran with the question of whether C had intended to kill so a separate direction about automatism was unnecessary. That would not have been so if there had been an alternative charge which was not of specific intent. The guilty verdict had involved a clear finding that despite his state of mind C intended to kill and thus he had acted voluntarily. However, it was not safe to say that in every case in which automatism was a possible and legitimate conclusion it should be removed from the jury if they had a decision to make about specific intent (paras [22-25](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). C's sentence was reduced from 18 to 15 years (paras [28-29](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(2) The expert's evidence was about disinhibited behaviour rather than behaviour over which M had no voluntary control. Disinhibition was exactly not automatism. Moreover, video footage of the incident made clear that M's behaviour was voluntary and automatism was simply not in question. Even if M had been in a state of automatism, that defence would have very likely failed on the grounds that he had induced it through voluntarily drinking himself into a state of intoxication. To the extent that his intoxication was worsened by the combination of the drug with alcohol, he was well aware of the dangers. His distress about his tinnitus would not alter that (paras [46-47](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) H's condition was caused by past voluntary intoxication, but he was not in any sense intoxicated at the time of the offence. He had stopped drinking five or six days earlier. As in Davis, H was not suffering from a direct or acute reaction to the voluntary taking of intoxicants. His condition was one of mental disorder with psychotic symptoms including the hearing of voices and hallucinations, complicated by clinical depression. He was entitled to have tried the question of whether he was actually aware of the risk that he created for his neighbours. His conviction was quashed. The Crown's argument would represent a significant extension to Majewski and the similar principle in Quick, Majewski and Quick considered.

(4) C's appeal against conviction was dismissed and his appeal against sentence was allowed. M's appeal against conviction was dismissed. H's appeal against conviction was allowed.
