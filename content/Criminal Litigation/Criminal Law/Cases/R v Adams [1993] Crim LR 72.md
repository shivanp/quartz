# R v Adams [1993] Crim LR 72

The defendant purchased goods not knowing that they were stolen. The trial court convicted him of theft on the basis that there had been a later appropriation under the Theft Act 1968, s 3(1) when he kept the goods after finding out that they were stolen. However, the conviction was quashed on appeal on the ground that the judge failed to direct the jury that he had a defence under the Theft Act 1968, s 3(2).
