# DPP for Northern Ireland v Maxwell [1978] 3 All ER 1140

Maxwell was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and had driven the principals to the pub where they planted a bomb. The organisation had a history of violent acts with explosives and firearms. Therefore, it was held that even if Maxwell did not know which crime would be committed among a variety of offences such as shooting people at the pub, committing a robbery at the pub or planting a bomb, he knew that planting a bomb was amongst those crimes he could be assisting, so was liable.
