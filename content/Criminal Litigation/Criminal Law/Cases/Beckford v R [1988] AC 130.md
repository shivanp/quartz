# Beckford v R [1988] AC 130

An honest belief in circumstances which, if true, would entitle a defendant to use force to defend himself, is sufficient for the defence of self-defence to succeed on a charge of murder. The reasonableness, or otherwise, of his belief is relevant, but only on the question of whether the belief was in fact honestly held. At his trial for murder, B. who was a police officer, claimed that he believed that the deceased had been shooting at him, and another officer; and that he had returned fire in self-defence. The trial judge's direction on self-defence referred to B having "reasonably believed" that his life was in danger. The jury convicted, and B was sentenced to death.

Held, allowing the appeal and quashing the conviction, that the correct test to be applied was whether B honestly believed the facts which, if true, would have entitled him to use reasonable force to protect himself. The reasonableness or otherwise of his belief was relevant only in so far as it went to support, or detract from, the honesty of his belief. Since it could not be certain that the jury would have reached the same verdict if properly directed, the proviso could not be applied and the conviction would be quashed.
