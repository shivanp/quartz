# R v Kelly and Lindsay [1999] QB 621

K was found guilty of the theft of approximately 35 human body parts from the Royal College of Surgeons after the trial judge, following the Australian case of _Doodeward v Spence 6 C.L.R. 406_ , ruled that there was property in a human body, or part of a human body, when it was altered in a manner designed to preserve it for medical or scientific examination. K appealed against conviction, contending that as, under the common law, there was no property in a corpse, there was no property in human body parts and they could not therefore be stolen, that the Royal College of Surgeons was not in lawful possession of the body parts and that the jury had not therefore been properly directed on the question of dishonesty.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that, while it was a long established principle of common law that there was no property in a corpse, the exception to that rule expressed in Doodeward v Spence was valid. Where a corpse, or part of a corpse, had undergone a process or application of human skill designed to preserve it for medical or scientific examination, it acquired a value and became property. The trial judge's summing up on the issue of possession could not be faulted since it was enough to show that the Royal College of Surgeons was in possession of the body parts and it was not necessary to show that the possession was lawful.
