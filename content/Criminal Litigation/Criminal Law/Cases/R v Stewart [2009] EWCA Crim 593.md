# R v Stewart [2009] EWCA Crim 593

## Summary

The court gave guidance for judges structuring a summing up in murder trials where the defendant raised a defence of diminished responsibility based solely on alcohol dependency syndrome without any observable brain damage.

## Abstract

The appellant (S) appealed against his conviction for murder.

S had killed the victim in the course of a fight. He suffered from alcohol dependency syndrome and in the 10 days before the killing had been drinking heavily. He had drunk particularly heavily on the day of the killing and put forward a defence of diminished responsibility based on alcohol dependency syndrome.

Psychiatrists called for both S and for the Crown agreed that he was a chronic alcoholic and that he had alcohol dependency syndrome, which had not caused brain damage. They disagreed, however, as to the effect of that syndrome on S's responsibility for his actions. S's psychiatrist was of the view that the syndrome constituted an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his responsibility for the killing. The Crown's psychiatrist took the view that it did not. His opinion was that, however chronic the alcoholism, the alcoholic always had a choice about whether, and how much, to drink.

The judge directed the jury that S had to satisfy them that at the time of the killing he was suffering from an abnormality of mind which was induced by alcohol dependency syndrome and which substantially impaired his mental responsibility for what he did. He directed them that the question of whether S had the capacity to resist the impulse to consume alcohol, in other words whether his consumption of alcohol was involuntary, was crucial to the issue of whether any abnormality of mind was induced by alcohol dependency syndrome.

S submitted that the judge's directions suggested that diminished responsibility could not be established unless, in effect, the defendant was acting as an automaton.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) The effect of the judge's directions was that the defence would not be available if the jury found that any of S's drinking was voluntary. Though those directions adequately reflected the law as it was understood at the date of trial, following the decision in _[R. v Wood (Clive) [2008] EWCA Crim 1305, [2009] 1 W.L.R. 496, [2008] 6 WLUK 510](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I823D4A8041AF11DDBA6DEC4A5C606B86/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e6f5746820c14fe3a22f0243f7d70664&contextData=(sc.Default))_ they were a misdirection, Wood followed. Justice required a re-examination of the case by the jury, directed in accordance with Wood.

(2) A trial judge structuring a summing up in relation to a defence of diminished responsibility based on alcohol dependency syndrome might wish at an early stage to reflect on the ordinary principles relating to voluntary intoxication. He should then outline the ingredients of the defence, effectively paraphrasing the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e6f5746820c14fe3a22f0243f7d70664&contextData=(sc.Default)) in the familiar way. The jury should then be directed to decide whether the defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing. For that purpose _[R. v Byrne (Patrick Joseph) [1960] 2 Q.B. 396, [1960] 7 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39602D00E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e6f5746820c14fe3a22f0243f7d70664&contextData=(sc.Default))_ continued to be of assistance, Byrne referred to. The judge was likely to direct the jury that it did not necessarily follow from the fact that the defendant suffered from alcohol dependency syndrome that he had established the necessary abnormality of mind. That depended on the jury's findings about the nature and extent of the syndrome and whether, looking at the matter broadly, the defendant's consumption of alcohol before the killing was fairly to be regarded as the involuntary result of an irresistible craving for drink. If the defendant proved the necessary abnormality of mind the next question was whether that was caused by disease or illness, and in the instant class of case the answer to that would normally follow from whatever answer was appropriate to the first question. Finally, assuming that the defendant's alcohol dependency syndrome did constitute an abnormality of mind due to disease or illness that was present at the time of the killing, directions about whether his mental responsibility for what he did was substantially impaired should be addressed in conventional terms. The jury should be assisted with the concept of substantial impairment, and might properly be invited to reflect on the difference between a failure and an inability to resist impulses. They were to be directed to consider all the evidence, including any medical evidence. The issues likely to arise, and on which they should be invited to form their own judgment would include the extent and seriousness of the defendant's dependency on alcohol; the extent to which his ability to control his drinking was reduced; whether he was capable of abstinence from alcohol, and if so for how long; and whether he was choosing for some particular reason to get drunk, or to drink more than usual. Without seeking to be prescriptive about considerations relevant to an individual case, the defendant's pattern of drinking in the days leading up to the killing and his ability to make apparently sensible and rational decisions about ordinary day-to-day matters at the relevant time might all bear on the jury's decision. Diminished responsibility always raised complex and difficult issues for the jury. Nevertheless, the resolution of those problems continued to be the responsibility of the jury, and they were inevitably required to make the necessary judgments not just on the basis of expert medical opinion but also by using their collective common sense and insight into the practical realities which underpinned the individual case.
