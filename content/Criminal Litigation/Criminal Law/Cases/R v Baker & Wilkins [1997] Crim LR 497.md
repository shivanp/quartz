# R v Baker & Wilkins [1997] Crim LR 497

FACTS: A mother could not raise the **CDA 1971, s 5(2)(b)** defence to a charge of criminal damage to a door that she had kicked open in order to rescue her child from a perceived threat by her estranged husband.

HELD: The court held that the child did not constitute 'property' for the purposes of the **CDA 1971, s 5(2)(b)**. If it had been a pet dog or cat, then the case might have been different, as these are property. For example, letting a person's pet parrot out of its cage could be criminal damage or theft of the bird.

B and her husband, W, appealed against convictions of criminal damage to the front door of a house, where the father of B's daughter was holding the child having refused to return her after a contact visit. B contended that (1) the defence of necessity had been widened in _[R. v Pommell (Fitzroy Derek) [1995] 2 Cr. App. R. 607, [1995] 5 WLUK 229](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60C1A861E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e667f1ccba784f2393bf49a1dcf87fd4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and could include circumstances other than those where there was an immediate fear of death or serious injury; (2) under the [Criminal Law Act 1967 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC9A39490E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e667f1ccba784f2393bf49a1dcf87fd4&contextData=(sc.Default)) the force was lawful because it was used in the prevention of the crimes of kidnapping, child abduction or false imprisonment; and (3) the [Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.5(2)(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0803E730E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e667f1ccba784f2393bf49a1dcf87fd4&contextData=(sc.Default)) provided a defence where such force was used to protect the property of an accused from damage and a fortiori would be a defence where the child of an accused was at risk.

Held, dismissing the appeals, that

(1) duress of circumstances could not be extended to circumstances where the defendant had feared serious psychological injury. There was a pressing need for Parliament to codify the defences of duress in line with the recommendations of the Law Commission to prevent such cases clogging the system;

(2) no criminal act had been committed by the father because he had a defence under the Child Abduction Act 1989 s.2(3)(i)(a) or s.2(3)(i)(b) and

(3) the child clearly did not represent property within the meaning of s.5(2)(b) of the 1971 Act, Pommell distinguished as merely accepting that necessity might be extended from driving cases to other charges except murder, attempted murder and treason.
