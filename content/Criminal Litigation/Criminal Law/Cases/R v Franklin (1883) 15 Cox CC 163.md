# R v Franklin (1883) 15 Cox CC 163

The mere fact of a civil wrong committed by one person against another ought not to be used as an incident which is a necessary step in a criminal case, apart from the question of criminal negligence. Therefore the mere fact of a person wrongfully taking up a box from a refreshment stall on a pier and wantonly throwing it into the sea, and thereby unintentionally causing the death of another bathing in the sea, is not per se and apart from the question of negligence sufficient to constitute the offence of manslaughter.
