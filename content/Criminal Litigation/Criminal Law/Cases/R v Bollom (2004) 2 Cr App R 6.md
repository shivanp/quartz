# R v Bollom (2004) 2 Cr App R 6

## Summary

In determining whether injuries sustained by a victim of an assault were "grievous" it was necessary to have regard to the effect of those injuries on the victim, taking into account the victim's age and health.

## Abstract

B appealed against his conviction for causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The victim was the 17-month-old daughter of B's partner, J. The victim had suffered non accidental bruising and abrasions to her body, arms and legs. The indictment against B had contained three alternative counts: causing grievous bodily harm with intent, inflicting grievous bodily harm and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. B argued that

(1) the judge ought to have acceded to the submission that the victim's injuries did not constitute grievous bodily harm;

(2) the judge should have directed the jury that a direct alternative charge to inflicting grievous bodily harm was that of occasioning actual bodily harm;

(3) the judge should not have given the jury the impression that the victim's age was a determining factor;

(4) the issue of the ages of the victim's bruises had not been addressed properly, and

(5) his conviction was unsafe in the light of J's admission after the trial that she was responsible for the injuries.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the judge ought to have directed the jury that they had to be sure not only that the injuries constituted grievous bodily harm, but also that they had been inflicted as part of one assault rather than as part of separate assaults;

(2) the judge's directions as to the different counts were impeccable. Where offences were charged as alternatives the jury should only be directed to the lesser charges once they had acquitted the defendant of the gravest charge;

(3) the judge had been entitled to direct the jury that the victim's age was a determining factor. In deciding whether injuries were grievous, they had to be considered in their real context, which included the effect of the harm on the particular victim;

(4) the ages of the bruises, and the possibility that they could have been inflicted at different times, were only relevant in terms of the judge's direction as to whether the injuries constituted grievous bodily harm and as to the effect of the victim's age, and

(5) J's admission that she was responsible for the victim's injuries was a false account and was a misguided attempt to assist B. The evidence that had been before the jury supported the prosecution's case that at least some of the injuries were inflicted by B. Accordingly, B's conviction for causing grievous bodily harm with intent would be quashed and would be substituted with a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
