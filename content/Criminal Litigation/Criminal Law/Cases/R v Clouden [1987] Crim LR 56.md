# R v Clouden [1987] Crim LR 56

FACTS: The defendant approached the victim from behind, wrenched her shopping bag out of her grasp with his hands, and ran off.

HELD: The Court of Appeal said that force used against the property must cause force against the person for this element to be satisfied. Force to detach property can count as force on the person and had done so here, so the conviction was upheld.

C approached X from behind and wrenched her basket down from her hands and made off with it.

Held, dismissing C's appeal against conviction of robbery, that the old distinction between force on the actual person and force on property causing force on the person had gone. Whether force was used on any person in order to steal was an issue for the jury (_[R. v Dawson (Anthony Mark) (1977) 64 Cr. App. R. 170, [1976] 2 WLUK 109](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3F419BA1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7f2b3748e3e84211ad24b5d6672c6b07&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
