# Hibbert v McKiernan [1948] 1 All ER 860

Every householder or landowner means or intends to exclude thieves and wrongdoers from his property, and this confers on him a special property in goods found on his land sufficient to support an indictment if the goods are taken therefrom, not under a claim of right, but with a felonious intent.

The appellant, under the Larceny Act, 1916, s.2, was charged with, and convicted of, stealing golf balls, the property of the secretary and members of a golf club. The appellant had picked up the golf balls, which had been previously lost by members, on the golf links on the day in question. On previous occasions the appellant had been warned off the links which were the property of members of the club. The appellant appealed against his conviction on the ground that the members of the club had no property in the balls, and that, therefore, he had not stolen them within the meaning of s.1 of the Larceny Act, 1916. Held, the question of ownership of the balls did not arise: the fact that the members of the club intended to exclude thieves and wrongdoers from the property occupied by them conferred on them a special property in the balls sufficient to support the charge, and, consequently, the appellant, who had picked them up animo furandi, was rightly convicted of larceny by finding.
