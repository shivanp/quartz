A woman gave a child a dose of poison and the child gave it to the victim.

The woman was the principal offender.

A prisoner was indicted for the murder of her infant child by poison. It appeared that the prisoner purchased a bottle of laudanum, and directed the person who had the care of the child to give it a teaspoonful every night. That person did not do so, but placed the bottle on the mantel-piece, where another little child found it, and gave part of the contents to the prisoner's child, who later died. The Court for Crown Cases Reserved held that the administering of the laudanum by the child was, under all the circumstances of the case, in point of law, an administering by the prisoner as if she had herself actually administered it with her own hand.
