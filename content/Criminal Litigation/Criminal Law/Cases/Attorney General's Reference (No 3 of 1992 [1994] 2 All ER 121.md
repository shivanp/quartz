# Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1992 [1994] 2 All ER 121

FACTS: The respondents were in a moving car from which a lighted petrol bomb was thrown at an occupied car, beside a pavement on which persons were standing. The bomb passed over the car and hit a wall adjacent to the pavement. The wall was not damaged. They were charged with attempted aggravated arson contrary the **Criminal Damage Act 1971, s 1(2) &(3)**. The _mens rea_ for the full offence is:

(a) intention or recklessness as to damaging property by fire; and

(b) intention or recklessness as to endangering life by the fire damage.

The _actus reus_ of this offence is damaging property by fire. There is no need for life to be endangered. The trial judge ruled that there was no evidence on which the jury could find an intent to endanger life so the respondents were not liable.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that for an attempt to commit aggravated arson (**Criminal Damage Act 1971, s 1(2) & (3)**), it was only necessary to prove an intent to achieve what was missing from the full offence, together with the other _mens rea_ required for the offence. In the present case, what was missing to prevent a conviction for the completed offence was damage to the property by fire. Therefore for an attempt it must be shown that D had an intention to damage property by fire and the remaining state of mind required for the offence of aggravated arson â€“ that is recklessness as to whether life was thereby endangered.

It was said that another way of putting it is that the defendant had the state of mind for the full offence and they intended to do the physical element which was missing.

Four respondents who had thrown a petrol bomb at a car and its occupants were acquitted of attempted aggravated arson when a judge ruled that recklessness on the part of the defendant as to whether life would be endangered as a result of the intended damage was, on an interpretation of the [Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.1(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I07FFEF90E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6dcc59153d804f3ea60242d101b2e93b&contextData=(sc.Default)) , insufficient to convict and that there must be an intention to endanger life. The case was referred by the Attorney General to the Court of Appeal for an opinion on a point of law under the [Criminal Justice Act 1972 s.36](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I26D46450E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6dcc59153d804f3ea60242d101b2e93b&contextData=(sc.Default)) .

Held: It was sufficient to prove that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would be endangered. For the completed aggravated offence, the prosecution had to prove that the defendant damaged property whilst in a state of mind where he was reckless as to whether the life of another would be endangered by his action. Here, although damage to property was intended but not achieved, the mental state of the defendant contained everything required to render him guilty of the full offence. The trial judge was wrong to distinguish _[R. v Khan (Mohammed Iqbal) [1990] 1 W.L.R. 813, [1990] 1 WLUK 712](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I512D77D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6dcc59153d804f3ea60242d101b2e93b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ which held that the mens rea for rape and attempted rape was exactly the same.
