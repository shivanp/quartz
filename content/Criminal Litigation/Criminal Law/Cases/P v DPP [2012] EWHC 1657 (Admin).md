# P v DPP [2012] EWHC 1657 (Admin)

FACTS: The defendant removed a cigarette from the victim's hand.

HELD: The Administrative Court held that there was no force as there had been no direct contact, any indirect contact was very minimal and there was no evidence of resistance from the victim. The court likened the defendant's acts to that of a pickpocket.

## Summary

For the purposes of the [Theft Act 1968 s.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF688C40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=989150e1791b4ef4bf016fa7bf36d4c8&contextData=(sc.Default)), an offence of robbery was not committed where an offender had snatched a cigarette from the complainant's hand, as the snatching without direct physical contact was not sufficient to constitute the use of "force" for the purposes of s.8. The offence committed was properly categorised as simple theft.

## Abstract

The appellants (P) appealed by way of case stated against their convictions for robbery of the victim (G).

G claimed that she had been walking along the road when she became aware of three young people, P, who asked her for a cigarette. She genuinely thought that P wanted a cigarette and she said she did not have a spare one. No violence was threatened at that time. Immediately after, one of them snatched a lit cigarette from her hand and passed it between the others. The prosecution case was that the snatching of the cigarette alone amounted to the use of force and did so whether or not there was any direct contact between G's hand and any of P's. The magistrates found that one of P had snatched a cigarette from G's hand; the snatch amounted to the use of force by P; the force was used to steal the cigarette; and there was a pre-arranged plan between P to rob G. The question for the court was whether the magistrates were correct to refuse a submission of no case to answer in respect of the allegation of robbery on the basis that the act of snatching the cigarette from G's hand, in the circumstances described, was sufficient to constitute "force" for the purposes of the [Theft Act 1968 s.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF688C40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=989150e1791b4ef4bf016fa7bf36d4c8&contextData=(sc.Default)).

P submitted that the snatching of the cigarette could not reasonably be deemed to constitute the use of force as it did not involve direct physical contact between them and G.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

The appeal raised a narrow and far from straightforward point. Before the enactment of the 1968 Act, and under the old law in the [Larceny Act 1916](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBF9691A082CD11E48A83BBF5A69499BC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=989150e1791b4ef4bf016fa7bf36d4c8&contextData=(sc.Default)), the answer to the question posed would have to have been answered negatively, as the old law required greater force than the mere taking of an item to constitute the offence of robbery. Section 8 required the use of force on a person or putting any person in fear of being subjected to force. Although the old distinctions under the 1916 Act had gone, there remained a basic requirement for the commission of the offence of theft that force was used on a person, _[R. v Dawson (Anthony Mark) (1977) 64 Cr. App. R. 170, [1976] 2 WLUK 109](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3F419BA1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=989150e1791b4ef4bf016fa7bf36d4c8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Clouden [1987] Crim. L.R. 56, [1985] 2 WLUK 16](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I854A58E0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=989150e1791b4ef4bf016fa7bf36d4c8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. There was on the facts found by the magistrates no physical contact between the hands of P and G. Borderline questions such as what amounted to the use of force where the force used was minimal was a matter for the first instance court and not for the appeal court. However, the magistrates had not found that P had used force on G; it found that the cigarette was snatched without necessarily any contact with G and that that amounted to the use of force by P to steal the cigarette. Those findings did not amount to a finding that force was used on G, unless the mere removal of the cigarette from her fingers amounted to the use of force. The instant case was similar to pick-pocketing where there was no direct physical contact between a thief and a victim. It could not be said that the minimal use of force to remove the cigarette between the fingers of a person sufficed to amount to the use of force on that person. It could not cause any pain unless the person resisted strongly, in which case direct physical contact would be expected between the thief and the victim. The unexpected removal of the cigarette between the fingers of a person was no more the use of force than the removal of an item from a pocket. The offence committed by P was properly categorised as simple theft. Their convictions for robbery would be quashed and substituted by convictions for theft (see paras 1, 5-6, 8-10, 13-16 of judgment).
