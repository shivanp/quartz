# R v Robinson [1977] Crim LR 173

FACTS: The defendant ran a clothing club. He was charged, inter alia, with robbery from the victim who contributed, with his wife, to the club. The defendant and two others approached the victim, whose wife owed £7 to the club. A fight ensued, and the defendant brandished a knife. A £5 note fell from the pocket of the victim. The defendant took the note and asked for £2 more. The defendant's defence in court was that he was not dishonest because he received the money as payment for the debt.

HELD: His conviction was quashed on the grounds that the trial judge had failed to direct the jury that he was entitled to an acquittal if he believed he had the legal right to take the property. See the [TA 1968, s 2(1)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/2). This case illustrates the legal principle that if there is no theft, there can be no robbery.

D was charged with robbery of P, who owed D GBP 7. D was convicted of theft after a direction that the defence under the [Theft Act 1968 s.2(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF664250E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b1a00227ad2f433e9a5e51c58e198049&contextData=(sc.Default)) required D's honest belief that he was entitled in law to get his money in a particular way.

Held, allowing D's appeal, it was unnecessary for D to show an honest belief that he was entitled to take the money and also that he was entitled to take it in the way he did. (_[R. v Skivington (Jim) [1968] 1 Q.B. 166, [1967] 1 WLUK 716](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I69EE7170E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b1a00227ad2f433e9a5e51c58e198049&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
