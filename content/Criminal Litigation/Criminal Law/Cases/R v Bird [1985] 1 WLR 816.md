# R v Bird [1985] 1 WLR 816

Failure to demonstrate unwillingness to fight is not fatal to a plea of self-defence. It is however, a factor to be taken into account. There was a fight at a party between D and her ex-boyfriend. D hit the man in the face with a glass with the result that he lost an eye. D was charged with unlawful wounding. She pleaded self-defence. The judge directed the jury that a person claiming to exercise a right of self-defence should demonstrate by her action that she did not want to fight. D was convicted and sentenced to youth custody.

Held, allowing the appeal, that failure to demonstrate unwillingness to fight was not fatal to a plea of self-defence. It was merely a factor to be taken into account. There was a material misdirection and consequently the conviction must be quashed ( _[R. v Julien (Thomas) [1969] 1 W.L.R. 839, [1969] 4 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I50A66D80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8a90e3c0176c46beac8ee5ab927fd0a0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ not followed).
