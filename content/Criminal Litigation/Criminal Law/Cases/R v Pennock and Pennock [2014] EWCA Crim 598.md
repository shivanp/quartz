# R v Pennock and Pennock [2014] EWCA Crim 598

In this case, the defendants, Mr and Mrs Pennock befriended Mrs Pennock's elderly great uncle, Mr Spann. Mr Spann was residing in New Zealand at the time but, partly for health reasons, he decided to move back to the UK.

When Mr Spann moved to the UK, he lived with Mr and Mrs Pennock for several months and his savings were put into various joint bank accounts in the names of Mr Spann and Mr Pennock. The evidence from the bank manager who set up these accounts was that Mr Spann was able to and happy to agree to the setting up of these accounts. It should be noted that all parties were considerably wealthy in their own right.

After a few months, a house was bought for Mr Spann to move into. The cost of the house was £265,000, of which £100,000 came from Mr Spann's savings. Mr Pennock transferred this money from one of the joint accounts to an account of his own before forwarding it on to the solicitor acting on the purchase. The house was bought in the names of Mr and Mrs Pennock but later transferred to their daughter, they claimed for tax planning reasons. The daughter did not pay anything for the house.

Mr and Mrs Pennock were charged with two offences of fraud by abuse of position. One for the transfer of the money from the joint account, and the second offence was for the transfer of title to the house to their daughter. They were convicted and appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Interestingly, the appeal was allowed following the court's application of the definition of abuse. The Court of Appeal seemed to suggest that, based on the indictment as drafted, on neither occasion had the defendants done anything illegal and therefore had not abused their position.

Regarding the first count, the court noted that in relation to a joint bank account, either signatory to the account can withdraw any amount of money unless there are specific restrictions put in place to prevent one signatory acting alone. There were no such restrictions here, therefore Mr Pennock had not acted 'improperly' in relation to the transfer.

Regarding the second offence, the Court of Appeal noted that, although Mr Spann's name did not appear on the title to the property, he nevertheless retained an equitable interest, given that his money was in part used to purchase it. As Mr and Mrs Pennock's daughter was not a _bona fide_ purchaser for value, her ownership was still subject to Mr Spann's equitable interest. The Court of Appeal stated that even if Mr and Mrs Pennock had been attempting to deprive Mr Spann of his equitable interest, they had failed to do so, therefore there had been no abuse of position.

**Reflection-_R v Pennock and Pennock_**

Having reflected upon this judgment, the Court of Appeal may well have got this wrong. Suggesting that the offence would only be committed following a successful unlawful act seems unduly narrow and contrary to the definition upon which they purport to rely. This would mean that a defendant, who dishonestly embarks on an improper purpose, will avoid criminal liability because it subsequently transpires that D’s acts are lawful.

Based on the definition used for the word 'abuse', it is submitted that cannot be right! The definition seems much wider than this application would suggest. Although it was not possible to question Mr Spann on this point, due to his ill health, it is likely that he would have confirmed that he had given Mr Pennock authorisation to conduct his affairs.

However, surely Mr Spann would have expected such acts to be carried out in a way that would be to his benefit. By definition, to do otherwise would be an 'improper' and/or 'incorrect' use of the position and therefore could amount to an abuse of that position. The Court of Appeal seems to have taken a very legalistic approach to the issue of authorisation and expectation.

Also, it appears that there is a degree of overlap between the abuse element and that of dishonesty. It seems logical that, if the jury conclude, by application of the _Ivey_ test, that the defendant is dishonest, they will also conclude that the defendant has abused their position.

Nevertheless, we have been directed by the Court of Appeal to deal with these elements separately, and until the matter is addressed further by the courts, it is the direction we are obliged to follow.

## Summary

Convictions for fraud by abuse of position were quashed in respect of a husband and wife who had withdrawn £100,000 of an elderly relative's money from a joint bank account and used it to purchase a property, the legal title of which they transferred to their daughter. The husband had had the authority to remove the money as a joint account holder, and the jury had not been properly directed that the relative's equitable interest in the property remained despite the transfer of legal title.

## Abstract

The appellant husband and wife (H and W) appealed against their convictions for two offences of fraud under the [Fraud Act 2006](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID9FDA5C0751A11DBB6BD9A07698D500F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=38e2768f57cc4a4c8506ebf91c94b22c&contextData=(sc.Default)).

H had set up four joint bank accounts with W's elderly uncle (S). £100,000 of S's money was removed from one of the accounts by H and was put towards the purchase of a property for S to live in. The property was conveyed into H and W's joint names as holders of the legal title. There was no document setting out an express declaration of trust in respect of S's interest in the property, nor was his financial contribution registered on the title to the property. W and H later transferred the legal title in the property to their daughter (X). It was S's case that he had not realised that he had opened joint accounts. He claimed he did not know that he had paid £100,000 towards the purchase of the property. H and W were accused of transferring £100,000 from S's bank account without permission (count 1) and with transferring the ownership of the property to X without recognising or protecting S's interest (count 2). At the trial, H and W submitted that there was no case to answer on count 1. The judge rejected that submission.

H and W submitted that the judge

(1) had erred in failing to accept the submission of no case to answer in respect of count 1;

(2) had made insufficient reference to the defence witnesses when summing up in relation to count 2;

(3) had failed to give a proper direction on the effect of delay on the defence's ability to deal with the allegations;

(4) had wrongly and prejudicially questioned two witnesses, namely the solicitor who did the conveyancing and her partner in the firm.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) Given that the £100,000 had been removed from a joint account of which H was a joint account holder, and given that there was no evidence that there was any restriction on his authority to act as a joint account holder, H had the authority to remove the money as a joint account holder. There was simply no case to answer given the way that the particulars of count 1 were framed. Accordingly, the appeal in relation to count 1 would be allowed. If the particulars of offence had been more carefully drafted and had concentrated on the use of the money to purchase the property, things might have been different (see paras [31-32](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of the judgment).

(2) The evidence of the prosecution witnesses and most of the defence witnesses was not significant in relation to count 2. The key issues were whether  
(a) H and W were in a fiduciary position towards S, which they plainly were;  
(b) they abused that position;  
(c) they acted dishonestly; and  
(d) they intended to make a gain for themselves or X. On those issues, the evidence of S and the other defence witnesses was of little significance. So, even if the summary in the summing up was not as comprehensive as it should have been, that did not affect the safety of the convictions on count 2 (paras [35-36](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The judge did not give any direction on delay. That ground of appeal did not have much, if any, force in relation to count 2. The jury's decision depended upon its interpretation of facts that were not really in dispute. The transfer to X was made. S was not told of it. His equitable interest was not noted on the transfer of the legal title. Therefore, the failure of the judge to give any direction in respect of delay could not affect the conviction on count 2 (para.[37](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) The judge was entitled to ask the conveyancing solicitor and the partner questions so that the position on a very technical area of conveyancing would be clearer for him and the jury (para.[38](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(5) The case in relation to count 2 was not properly presented to the jury by the judge in his summing up. The fact that S had an equitable interest in the property to the extent of his contribution was not explained to the jury. It should have been directed on the law to the effect that, even once the transfer of the legal title to X had taken place, S's equitable interest in the property remained intact, because X was not a bona fide purchaser of the legal estate for value without notice of his interest, as she had not given any value for the transfer. It should have been told as a matter of law that, even assuming that H and W were attempting to deprive S of his interest in the property, they had failed to do so. It was impossible to say whether such a statement would have made any difference to the jury's conclusion, but the fact was that the technical legal position was not explained to the jury. Accordingly, the convictions on count 2 were not safe and had to be quashed (paras [39-40](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
