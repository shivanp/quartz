# R v Instan [1893] 1 QB 450

Instan lived with her aunt, who was 73 years old. Her aunt gave Instan money to provide both of them with food. The aunt developed gangrene in her leg and became bedridden. Instan used the money to buy food for herself but did not give any to her aunt, nor did she summon medical assistance. The aunt died and Instan was convicted of her manslaughter due to voluntary assumption of a duty of care.
