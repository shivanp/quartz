# Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576

The appellant was convicted of manslaughter resulting from the reckless and dangerous driving. He appealed on the grounds that the judge misdirected the jury: (i) in telling them that if they thought that the appellant was driving recklessly and dangerously within the [Road Traffic Act 1930, s 11](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251930_43a_SECT_11%25&A=0.34012281686456647&backKey=20_T486085522&service=citation&ersKey=23_T486085508&langcountry=GB), and it was because of that that the person was killed, it was their duty to convict him of manslaughter; and (ii) in failing to tell them that, unless the appellant had been proved guilty of negligence that showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State, they should not find him guilty of manslaughter. The House of Lords, dismissing the appeal, held that the effect of the summing up as a whole had been that the true question was ultimately left to the jury. The statutory offence of dangerous driving could still be committed where the negligence was not of such a degree as would amount to manslaughter if death ensued.
