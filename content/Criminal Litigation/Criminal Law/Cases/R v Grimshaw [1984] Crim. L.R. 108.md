# R v Grimshaw [1984] Crim. L.R. 108

G struck X in a public house. X's glass went into his face causing extensive eye injuries.

Held, allowing G's appeal against conviction of inflicting grievous bodily harm maliciously, contrary to the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=49d34e26b0654b899a87c9a1e0a9e23d&contextData=(sc.Search)) , that the judge had erred in directing the jury that it was sufficient if G ought to have foreseen that some physical harm, although minor, might result from her act. The right question was what G did foresee, not what she ought to have foreseen ( _[R. v Mowatt (Sidney Linton) [1968] 1 Q.B. 421, [1967] 6 WLUK 66](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5ADD2C80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=49d34e26b0654b899a87c9a1e0a9e23d&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied).
