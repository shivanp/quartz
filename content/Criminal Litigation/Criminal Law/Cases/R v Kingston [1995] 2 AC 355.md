# R v Kingston [1995] 2 AC 355

Kingston (K) admitted to paedophiliac tendencies, which he said he managed to keep under control. As a result of a business dispute, P, arranged to blackmail K by photographing and audiotaping him in a compromising situation. P lured a boy of 15 to his flat, where he gave the boy sedatives and some cannabis. The boy fell asleep on the bed and remembered nothing until he woke up the next morning. P invited K to his flat and gave him some coffee. He then showed K the boy asleep on a bed and invited him to indecently assault the boy. This the appellant did, and he was photographed and taped doing so. K's defence was that he was involuntarily intoxicated. He claimed that P had drugged the coffee and this had the effect of making him lose his inhibitions and commit the offence. The House of Lords held that K was liable, saying that if he had still formed the mens rea in his intoxicated state, it was no defence to plead that he would not have committed the offence when sober.

In criminal proceedings, if it is proved that the necessary intent was present when the necessary act was done by him, a defendant does not have open to him a defence of involuntary intoxication. There is no such defence at common law, and the interests of justice do not demand its adoption. K, a homosexual with paedophiliac predelictions, was charged with indecent assault on a 15-year-old boy. K raised the defence of involuntary intoxication as he had been drugged by his co-defendant, P, who intended to blackmail him. He claimed that he had suffered effects as a result of the intoxication that, while not making him insensible, annulled the criminal liability that his acts would otherwise have involved. The judge directed the jury that an intent induced by a secretly administered drug was nevertheless an intent. K was convicted by a majority verdict. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction ([1994] Q.B. 81), finding that where an intent which would not otherwise have been formed was induced by drink or drugs surreptitiously administered the operative fault is not the defendant's, and the mens rea is negatived. The Crown appealed to the House of Lords.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the ruling and direction of the trial judge were correct. If it was proved that the necessary intent was present when the necessary act was done by him, a defendant did not have open to him a defence of involuntary intoxication;

(2) there was no principle that an accused exceptionally may be acquitted where although an act was intentional the intent arose out of circumstances for which the accused was not to blame, nor that if blame or moral fault was absent the necessary mens rea must also be absent (_[Chiu-Cheung v Queen, The [1995] 1 A.C. 111, [1994] 6 WLUK 164](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I86E0AE20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4d64c01e5123436e9cdc608b7f1ac0dc&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered);

(3) the loss of self-control through the intervention of a third party did not in general constitute a defence although there may be substantial mitigation;

(4) it was perilous to base any decision on involuntary intoxication on old dicta on the topic (Pearson's Case, 2 Lew 144 doubted in part);

(5) the doctrines of “transferred intent” and estoppel found in the law on voluntary intoxication did not apply to involuntary intoxication, but this did nothing to add involuntary intoxication as a defence where intent was proved (_[DPP v Majewski [1977] A.C. 443, [1976] 4 WLUK 71](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AF95560E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4d64c01e5123436e9cdc608b7f1ac0dc&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered); and

(6) the defence of involuntary intoxication was not already established as a defence at common law in other jurisdictions, but the Court of Appeal treated it as a matter of existing law and it did not therefore consider the implications of recognising a new defence which ran into difficulties at every turn. The interests of justice did not demand the adoption of a new defence
