# R v White [1910] 2 KB 124

FACTS: W put poison in a drink intending to kill his mother. She was subsequently found dead. It was not clear on the evidence whether she had drunk any of the liquid from the glass. Medical evidence showed that she had died from heart failure, not from poisoning.

HELD: W was therefore acquitted of murder, there being no causal link between the consequence and his act. However, he was guilty of attempted murder.
