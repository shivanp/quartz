# R v Emmett (1999) The Times, 15 October

FACTS: The parties were involved in consensual activities with the defendant tying a plastic bag over his fianc√©e's head in order to increase her sexual pleasure. He also, with her consent, poured lighter fuel on her breasts and set fire to it.

HELD: The court saw this as violent conduct which moved beyond those acts which can be consented to.
