# R v Sheppard [1981] AC 394 (HL)

The test as to mens rea in wilful neglect to maintain a child is subjective. A 16-month old child died of hypothermia and malnutrition; for some days previously the child had been vomiting and unable to ingest food. Medical attention might have saved the child, but the parents, poor and of low intelligence, failed to call a doctor. The judge directed the jury that the test for wilful neglect was objective; they were both convicted. On appeal, held, allowing the appeal, that the correct test was whether a parent was aware that medical aid might be necessary, or was uncaring whether such aid was necessary or not ( _[R. v Senior [1899] 1 Q.B. 283, [1898] 12 WLUK 43](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I69589A10E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a96f92c4cba94f928477e71c0db2ebba&contextData=(sc.Default))_ explained).
