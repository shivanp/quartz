# R v Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB 354

FACTS: Stone lived with his mistress Dobinson. They were both of low intelligence and described as ‘inadequate’. They both accepted into their home Stone's elderly, weak and anorexic sister, Fanny. They tried to make her eat but gave up. Eventually Fanny was confined to her bed and Stone and Dobinson failed to get medical assistance. As a result Fanny died.

HELD: Stone and Dobinson were convicted of her manslaughter, and their convictions were upheld, on the basis that, although neither was under a duty imposed by law to care for an ailing relative, they had voluntarily assumed this duty upon themselves.
