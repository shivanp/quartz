# R v Webster [1995] 2 All ER 168

FACTS: The defendants had pushed a coping stone from a bridge onto a train, which had hit a carriage, showering the passengers with debris from the roof. The conviction had been based on a direction that intent to endanger life by the stone falling on a passenger would suffice.

HELD: The court substituted a conviction based on recklessness (per Taylor CJ):

> 'If the defendant's intention is that the stone itself should crash through the roof of a train or motor vehicle and thereby directly injure a passenger, or if he was reckless only as to that outcome, the section would not bite. If, however, the defendant intended or was reckless that the stone would smash the roof of the train or vehicle so that metal or wood struts from the roof would or obviously might descend upon a passenger, endangering life, he would surely be guilty. This may seem to many a dismal distinction.'

For an offence of damaging property with intent to endanger life or being reckless as to whether life was endangered, it was necessary to prove that the danger to life resulted from the damage, not from the act causing the damage. It was necessary to consider whether and how the defendant intended to endanger life. In one case, D1 had pushed a coping stone off a railway bridge on to a train. The stone landed on the train and penetrated the roof. In the second case, a stolen car was driven by D2 who threw bricks at a pursuing police car, smashing its rear window. D2 then rammed the police car several times. Both were convicted of causing damage with intent to endanger life and both appealed, contending that the facts proved against them did not support such a finding.

Held, on the first appeal, substituting a conviction of damaging property being reckless as to whether life was endangered, that if it was the dropping of the stone that caused the danger then the section would not apply since it had to be the damage caused by that act that endangered life. Nevertheless on the facts the jury must be taken to have found that D1 intended that the stone should crash through the roof of the carriage which would endanger life and that D1 was reckless to the danger that would cause. On the second appeal the throwing of a brick at the windscreen of a moving vehicle caused damage to the vehicle and the damage caused could endanger life by causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. D2's conviction was upheld ( _[R. v Steer (Dennis) [1988] A.C. 111, [1987] 7 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6ACAEEC0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=baff5b268a504d278febdd5e94caa9b3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
