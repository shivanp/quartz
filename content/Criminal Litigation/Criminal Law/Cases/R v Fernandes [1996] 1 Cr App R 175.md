# R v Fernandes [1996] 1 Cr App R 175

FACTS: Fernandes was a solicitor who transferred money out of his clients' accounts and invested it in a risky money-lending business. The money was lost. He claimed not to have had an intention to permanently deprive, as he intended to return the money. It was argued on his behalf that the Theft Act 1968, s 6(1) only covered cases of selling the owner his own property, of borrowing and of pawning (which is covered by the Theft Act 1968, s 6(2)).

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that these were merely three examples of treating property as your own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights and there could be others â€“ Auld LJ:

> 'We consider that section 6 may apply to a person in possession or control of another's property who, dishonestly and for his own purpose, deals with that property in such a manner that he knows he is risking its loss.'

F, a solicitor, was convicted of theft and of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception on the first indictment and of two counts of theft on the second indictment. He was sentenced to two terms of two years' imprisonment concurrent on the former count and two and a half years concurrent on the latter. F had removed money from two client accounts. Some of the monies were used to service personal commitments, others he had invested through R in a money lending business. R said that he had repaid the money but F denied that. It was the prosecution case that the theft took place either before or after the money was paid to R. F did not give evidence and called no witnesses. F appealed on grounds that, in relation to the first indictment, the conviction was wrong in law. In respect of the second indictment F appealed on grounds that

1. there was no case to answer as the dates referred to in the indictment did not correspond with the Crown's case;
2. the judge had failed to direct the jury that in order to convict they must be unanimous as to the point at which the theft occurred;
3. the judge had failed to warn the jury as to the dangers of convicting on R's uncorroborated evidence;
4. on the second charge of theft of probate money there was no case to answer as there was no primary evidence to show that F was not a beneficiary;
5. the judge failed to direct the jury that they must be satisfied that the terms of the will did not entitle F to pay the money into his personal account;
6. the judge was wrong to comment as he did in respect of F not giving evidence;
7. the judge's direction on theft under the [Theft Act 1968 s.6(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c4a5234d4c97411b96cfdd24ef969aca&contextData=(sc.Default)) was an inappropriate direction, and
8. the judge was wrong in directing the jury that they could infer intention from investment in an unsafe investment.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, and refusing leave to appeal against sentence, that on the first indictment, the act of execution relied upon by the Crown involved the dating of the charge by the lender's solicitor and did not constitute an act of execution as required by the [Theft Act 1968 s.20(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF79CA50E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c4a5234d4c97411b96cfdd24ef969aca&contextData=(sc.Default)) and was therefore wrong in law and the conviction on the second count of the first indictment was accordingly quashed. In respect of the second indictment,

1. the precise dates in the indictment were wrong, but that was immaterial in the circumstances. The evidence that F passed the money to R was sufficient for a charge of theft;
2. the judge had made it clear that they should consider the point at which F placed the money with R to be relevant to the allegations of theft;
3. the judge had clearly warned the jury to that effect;
4. the defence had the opportunity to challenge the admissibility of the secondary evidence which they did not do, and accordingly the jury was entitled to draw the inference that F was not a beneficiary;
5. the court considered that dishonesty had been established as the jury were satisfied that he was not a beneficiary and his status had been clarified to that effect since the admission by the Crown of a true copy of the will;
6. the judge gave the conventional direction and then referred quite properly to three prosecution witnesses' statements which F had not answered;
7. in relation to the first count of theft, s.6(1) was appropriate and not limited to examples such as borrowing and using tickets. Section 6 of the 1968 Act applied to such a person such as F who dealt with another's property in a dishonest manner and for his own purpose where there was a risk of losing that property. The direction had not watered down the requirement that the jury had to be sure of an intention permanently to deprive. It was clear that s.6 was not applicable to the second charge of theft, and the jury must have understood that;
8. the judge did not imply that the jury could determine F's intention by reference to what turned out to be an unsatisfactory investment.
