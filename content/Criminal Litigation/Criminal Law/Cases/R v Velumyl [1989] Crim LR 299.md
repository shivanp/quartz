# R v Velumyl [1989] Crim LR 299

FACTS: The defendant had borrowed money from his employer's safe, even though he knew this was against company rules. He said he intended to repay it on the following day after a debt had been repaid to him.

HELD: It was held by the Court of Appeal that intending to return notes and coins of an equivalent value is not the same as intending to return the identical ones that were taken. Therefore, although such an intention may be relevant to the issue of dishonesty, it does not negative the intention to permanently deprive the owner of the original notes and coins.

V, a manager, took GBP 1,050 from a safe at work without permission and in breach of company rules. He claimed to police that he had lent the money to a friend and expected to return it on the following Monday. He appealed against the conviction for theft on the ground that he had no intention permanently to deprive the owner of the money, albeit that he would not be able to replace the exact notes or coins taken.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge had correctly ruled that V's intention to repay the money (with different notes or coins) did not afford V a defence. He had the requisite intention permanently to deprive. He had no intention to return the objects he had taken. It had not been suggested that there was a lack of dishonesty on V's part _[R. v Feely (David) [1973] Q.B. 530, [1972] 12 WLUK 76](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I436E2E50E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4006442913e54ab6b6620bc9e12b6a9e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Cockburn (John James) [1968] 1 W.L.R. 281, [1967] 12 WLUK 73](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3DDD0290E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4006442913e54ab6b6620bc9e12b6a9e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
