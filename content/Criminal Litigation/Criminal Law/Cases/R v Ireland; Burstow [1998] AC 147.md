# R v Ireland; Burstow [1998] AC 147

Technically, on this issue, the comments made by their Lordships were _obiter_ since the defendants in these two cases had repeatedly made silent telephone calls to their victims. No words had been spoken. Lord Hope of Craighead believed that silence conveyed a message to the victim and as such was capable of forming the basis of an assault. Indirectly, this confirms that words spoken may amount to an assault since they too convey a message and one that is arguably more direct than silence.

Immediacy:

> ‘After all, there is no reason why a telephone caller who says to a woman in a menacing way ‘I will be at your door in a minute or two’ may not be guilty of an assault if he causes his victim to apprehend immediate personal violence. Take now the case of the silent caller. He intends by his silence to cause fear, and he is so understood. The victim is assailed by uncertainty about his intentions. Fear may dominate her emotions, and it may be the fear that the caller’s arrival at her door may be imminent. She may fear the possibility of immediate personal violence.’

Two separate appeals raised the issue of whether or not psychiatric injury was within the ambit of [ss 20](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251861_100a_SECT_20%25&A=0.08282438044964546&backKey=20_T495999865&service=citation&ersKey=23_T495999847&langcountry=GB) and [47](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251861_100a_SECT_47%25&A=0.7547410898442778&backKey=20_T495999865&service=citation&ersKey=23_T495999847&langcountry=GB) of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The House of Lords held: (i) in the light of the best current scientific appreciation of the link between the body and psychiatric injury, the words ‘bodily harm’ in ss 20 and 47 of the Act were capable of covering recognised psychiatric illnesses which affected the central nervous system of the body; and (ii) the making of silent telephone calls which caused psychiatric injury to a victim was capable of amounting to an assault in law under s 47 of the Act where the calls caused the victim to apprehend an immediate application of force. Furthermore, an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under s 20 of the 1861 Act could be committed even though no physical violence was applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim.

I was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to the [Offences against the Person Act 1861 s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C0F52C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=800f81586dab43419bcef576b6b416fd&contextData=(sc.Default)) after pleading guilty to making malicious telephone calls to women. He appealed against the dismissal of his appeal against conviction.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that a recognisable psychiatric illness suffered by a victim of malicious telephone calls amounted to "bodily harm" within the meaning of the Act, _[R. v Chan-Fook (Mike) [1994] 1 W.L.R. 689, [1993] 10 WLUK 234](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3A1A0720E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=800f81586dab43419bcef576b6b416fd&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. Given that harassment of women by malicious calls was a significant social problem against which the law should be able to provide protection, the Act should be construed in the light of the scientific knowledge current at the time of the offence, notwithstanding the fact that psychiatric illness was not considered to be bodily harm during the original drafting of the Act. An assault was committed under s.47 if the victim was caused to apprehend imminent personal violence and the question whether a malicious telephone caller was guilty of assault would thus be a question of fact in each case.
