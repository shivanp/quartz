# Saunders [1985] Crim LR 230

## Abstract

S was convicted of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. The judge directed the jury that grievous bodily harm meant "serious injury".

Held, dismissing S's appeal, that the omission of the word "really" before "serious injury" made no difference at all in this case, since a broken nose on any view was really serious bodily harm. It was doubted whether the omission of the word "really" was ever a proper ground of appeal ( _[DPP v Smith [1961] A.C. 290, [1960] 7 WLUK 136](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9B0E8B10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b4e628a817bc4055a0b4bed0f82d93ac&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and R. v. McMillan (Unreported October 8 1984 CA) considered).
