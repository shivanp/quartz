# R v Bourne (1952) 36 Cr App R 125

The offence of buggery whether with man or beast does not depend upon consent; it depends on the act, and if an act of buggery is committed, the felony is committed. The appellant was convicted on two counts of an indictment charging him with aiding and abetting his wife to commit buggery with a dog. The evidence showed that the appellant had on each occasion sexually excited the animal, and had then compelled his wife to submit to the insertion of its male organ into her vagina. The wife stated in her evidence that she had been terrorised into submission and that the acts were entirely against her will. Hallet J. left questions to the jury as follows: (1) "did the prisoner [on a specific date at a certain place] cause his wife â€¦ to have carnal knowledge of a dog?" to which the jury replied "Yes." (2) "Are you satisfied that she did not consent to having such carnal knowledge?" to which the jury replied "Yes, we are satisfied she did not consent."

Held, on appeal,

(1) the court had been unable to find any exceptional question of criminal law involved which justified a special verdict;

(2) even if the wife if charged herself with committing the offence could have set up a plea of duress, such a plea would not have shown that no offence had been committed but would have shown that she had no mens rea because her will had been overborne by threats of imprisonment or violence so that she would have been excused from punishment; consequently, the appellant was a principal in the second degree to the crime of buggery and an aider and abettor.
