# R v Wallace [2018] EWCA Crim 690

FACTS: The defendant, had thrown sulphuric acid over her exboyfriend, Mark Van Dongen. This had left him, not only disfigured, but completely paralysed and in a permanent state of unbearable constant pain which was not capable of being alleviated by drugs. His father took him home to Belgium, where it became clear that the paralysis would be permanent. The immediate cause of death was voluntary euthanasia by a lethal injection, lawfully administered to him in a hospital in Belgium by Belgian doctors. At Wallace’s trial for murder the judge withdrew the charge of murder from the jury on the basis that the victim’s choice to die and the actions of the doctors in helping him were free, voluntary informed acts which broke the chain of causation.

HELD: The Court of Appeal, Sharp LJ giving the judgment, held that it was open to the jury to find that the acts of the victim and the doctors who administered the injection were not voluntary acts. The questions the court posed for legal causation were:

1. Are you sure that the D’s unlawful act was a significant and operating cause of death?
2. If yes, are you sure that at the time of the acid attack it was reasonably foreseeable that victim would die by suicide as a result of V’s injuries?
