# R v Dudley [1989] Crim LR 57 (CA)

FACTS: Dudley had a grievance against the ‘J’ family. He consumed drink and drugs and threw a firebomb at their house. The fire was extinguished by the J family and only trivial damage was caused. D’s counsel claimed that it must be proved that he intended to endanger life or had been reckless as to whether life was endangered by the actual damaged caused and that as the damage caused was not great, he could not have been reckless as to endangering life.

HELD: The Court of Appeal disagreed. The words ’destruction or damage’ in **section 1(2)(b)** referred back to the destruction or damage intended or as to which there was recklessness, not to the destruction or damage actually caused.
