# R v Jones (Ivor) (1993) The Times, 15 February

FACTS: J, a milkman, was convicted of obtaining property by deception for overcharging for crates of milk. The purchaser regarded J as a friend.

> 'It is true that [the victim] was not gullible in the same sense as was alleged in the case of **_Silverman_**. He was an experienced businessman who has been running a busy corner shop for many years â€¦ But he was gullible in the sense that in his busy life he never for a minute felt that he needed to check what **his long time and trusted friend** asked for each week or to relate it to the actual quantities received. It may be that he was remarkably stupid or careless about this. But on the evidence it was a stupidity or carelessness born of trust, and it was a stupidity or carelessness of which the appellant was aware and of which he was able to take advantage for many years.' (_Per_ Auld J)

J, a milkman, supplied one shop with milk for many years. The shop owner paid weekly without questioning the amount requested. On investigating why his shop was unprofitable, however, he compared the amount supplied with payments made and was horrified to discover how much he was charged. J was charged with obtaining property by deception contrary to the [Theft Act 1968, s.15](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF747320E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c10363abdb774383b09238f680b482fd&contextData=(sc.Search)), the indictment setting out that he deceived the shop owner by misrepresenting the value of milk delivered. J admitted dishonesty but submitted there was no deception. J appealed against conviction.

Held: Appeal dismissed. The shop owner had paid the amounts requested as a result of remarkable stupidity or carelessness, of which J was aware. J had therefore deceived the shop owner. _[R. v Silverman (Michael John) (1988) 86 Cr.
