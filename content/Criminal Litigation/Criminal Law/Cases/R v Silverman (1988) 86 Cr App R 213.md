# R v Silverman (1988) 86 Cr App R 213

This case concerned a builder who had worked for the family of two elderly sisters for a number of years. On several occasions, he charged excessive amounts for work done on their home. He argued that he made no specific comment about the fairness of the charge.

> 'It seems clear to us that the complainants, far from being worldly-wise, were unquestionably gullible … [T]hey relied implicitly upon the word of the appellant about their requirements in their maisonette. In such **circumstances of mutual trust**, one party depending upon the other for fair and reasonable conduct, the criminal law may apply if one party takes dishonest advantage of the other by representing as a fair charge that which he but not the other knows is dishonestly excessive.' (_Per_ Watkins LJ – emphasis added.)

Note that the method the Court of Appeal used to impose liability in these circumstances was to imply a false representation into the dealings between the defendant and the victims that the charge made was a fair one.

Watkins LJ referred in the quote above to the victims in _Silverman_ as being 'far from worldly-wise’ and ‘unquestionably gullible'. Does this mean that an essential factor required where overcharging can be regarded as fraud, is that the victim is in some way 'vulnerable'?

Where the defence of a defendant who does not give evidence is set out in interviews with the police, the judge should direct the jury's attention to them. S charged two sisters grossly excessive prices for work done. He was known to them and they trusted him to charge a fair price. S had lengthy interviews with the police to the effect that he had made no representations to the sisters and they seemed happy with the prices. The defendent did not give evidence. The judge referred to the interviews only in passing. S was convicted and appealed because the judge had not put his defence before the jury.

Held, allowing the appeal, that S's defence, worthless though it may have been to the jury, was not properly put to them and, as it was the only evidence in favour of S, the judge had misdirected the jury. This was not a case where the proviso of the [Criminal Appeal Act 1968](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I606CC3E0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=acbf475cfe3048bebb063867cf665075&contextData=(sc.Default)) could be applied (_[R. v Hamand (Graham Alan) (1986) 82 Cr.
