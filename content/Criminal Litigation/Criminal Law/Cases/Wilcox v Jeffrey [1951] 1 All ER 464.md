# Wilcox v Jeffrey [1951] 1 All ER 464

H, an American jazz musician, played at a concert in London despite the fact that his permission to enter the UK prohibited him from working. W attended the concert and later wrote a favourable review in a magazine that he owned. It was held that W’s presence at the concert was an encouragement to the offence.

## Summary

Where a man is charged with aiding and abetting an illegal act, it does not matter what that illegal act is, provided that the aider and abettor knows the facts sufficiently well to know that they would constitute an offence in the principal.

## Abstract

In _[R. v Coney (1882) 8 Q.B.D. 534, [1882] 3 WLUK 69](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3E118010E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=507a02ce8b3d4338b8c79ae34d1dea6a&contextData=(sc.Default))_, Cave J observed: "Where presence may be entirely accidental, it is not even evidence of aiding and abetting. Where presence is prima facie not accidental it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the jury".

An alien saxophone player was given permission to land in England on condition that he took no employment paid or unpaid in the United Kingdom. The appellant, a magazine owner and editor, was aware of the condition imposed on the alien's landing. In the evening the appellant attended a concert as a spectator, having paid for his ticket. The alien went on the stage and entertained the audience by playing the saxophone. The appellant did not get up or make any protest. Afterwards he published in his magazine a most laudatory description, fully illustrated, of this concert. On those facts the magistrate found that the appellant had aided and abetted the contravention of the Aliens Order 1920 Art.18(2).

Held, on appeal, the appellant having been present at the concert, not only to approve and encourage what had been done, but to take advantage of it by getting “copy” for his paper, there was evidence on which the magistrate could find that the appellant aided and abetted, _[R. v Coney (1882) 8 Q.B.D. 534, [1882] 3 WLUK 69](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3E118010E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=507a02ce8b3d4338b8c79ae34d1dea6a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.

The appellant magazine publisher was convicted of unlawfully aiding and abetting an American musician to contravene art 1(4) of the Aliens Order 1920, by failing to comply with the condition that he would not take any employment, paid or unpaid. The appellant was present when the musician attended a concert and gave a performance when invited by the organisers. He further wrote a laudatory commentary on the musician’s performance and published photographs in his magazine. The King’s Bench Division held that the appellant’s presence at the concert was not accidental. It was open to find that his presence was an encouragement to the musician to commit an offence against art 1(4) of the Order, and to convict him of aiding and abetting, under art 18(2).
