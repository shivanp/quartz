# Blake v DPP [1993] Crime LR 586

FACTS: The defendant attempted to rely on the CDA 1971, s 5(2)(a) defence using a novel argument. During a demonstration protesting about the use of military force by the allies in Iraq and Kuwait, Blake, a vicar, used a marker pen to write a Biblical quotation on a concrete pillar at the Houses of Parliament.

He appealed against his conviction for criminal damage, claiming, inter alia, that he was carrying out the instructions of God. He argued that he had lawful excuse under the CDA 1971, s 5(2)(a) in that he believed God to be the one entitled to consent to the damage.

The defendant put forward the additional argument that he was entitled to rely on the CDA 1971, section 5(2)(b) because he had acted to protect property in the Gulf States.

HELD: The QBD dismissed his appeal, holding that a belief, however powerful, genuine and honestly held, that God had given consent was not a lawful excuse under the domestic law of England.

Applying the objective test from Hunt, the court held that his actions were not capable of having the effect of protecting property in the Gulf states.
