# R v Denton [1982] 1 All ER 65

FACTS: The owner of a factory in financial difficulties had apparently said to D: 'There is nothing like a good fire for improving the financial circumstances of a business'. D took this as an instruction to set fire to the factory, which he did.

HELD: His conviction for arson was quashed, the Court of Appeal holding that he was entitled to the **CDA 1971, s 5(2)(a)** defence.

It is not unlawful under the [Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.1(1) and s.1(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I07FFEF90E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5846ddf7ab6749a38a32efe3bb7026a1&contextData=(sc.Default)) to set fire to one's own property, even as part of an inchoate attempt to commit fraud. D, on his employer's instructions, set fire to his employer's factory. At the time he knew that the employer intended to make a fraudulent insurance claim, but thought that the employer was entitled to consent to the damage. D was charged with arson. On the judge's ruling that the employer was not "entitled" to consent to damage for a fraudulent purpose, under the [Criminal Damage Act 1971 s.5(2)(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0803E730E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5846ddf7ab6749a38a32efe3bb7026a1&contextData=(sc.Default)) D pleaded guilty.

Held, on appeal by D, allowing the appeal, that it was not unlawful under s.1(1) and (3) of the Act to set fire to one's own property, even as part of an inchoate attempt to commit fraud.
