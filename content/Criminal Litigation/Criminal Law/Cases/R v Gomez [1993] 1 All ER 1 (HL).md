# R v Gomez [1993] 1 All ER 1 (HL)

FACTS: Gomez was the assistant manager at an electrical store, and he allowed his co-accused to purchase electrical goods from the shop using two stolen building society cheques. Gomez asked the shop manager to authorise the sale of the goods by accepting the cheques in payment. The shop manager told Gomez to check with the bank that the cheques were acceptable. Gomez pretended to do this and later told the shop manager that the cheques were 'as good as cash'. The sale went ahead, and the cheques were subsequently dishonoured. Gomez and his co-accused were charged with theft. Gomez argued that he could not be guilty of theft since the shop manager had authorised the transactions and so there had been no appropriation. Gomez was convicted of theft, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal.

HELD: The Court of Appeal certified the following point of law of general public importance for appeal to the House of Lords:

> 'When theft is alleged and that which is alleged to be stolen passes to the defendant with the consent of the owner, but that consent has been obtained by a false representation, has, (a) an appropriation within the meaning of section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968 taken place, or, (b) must such a passing of property necessarily involve an element of adverse [interference] with or usurpation of some right of the owner?'

The majority of the House answered that there could still be an appropriation where property has passed with the owner's consent, as there was no need for an adverse interference with the owner's rights.

Lord Browne-Wilkinson said:

> 'I regard the word “appropriation” in isolation as being an objective description of the act done, irrespective of the mental state of either the owner or the accused.'

A person who obtains by deception the agreement of the owner of goods to sell these in return for a stolen cheque is guilty of wrongful appropriation of goods. A shop assistant was approached by a person bearing stolen cheques and, knowing the cheques were stolen, the assistant persuaded the shop manager to sell on goods on the strength of them. The assistant was convicted of theft at the first instance, but was acquitted by the Court of Appeal. The Crown appealed to the House of Lords.

Held, allowing the appeal, that an act authorised by the owner of goods could still constitute wrongful appropriation of goods, where such consent had been obtained by deception ( _[Lawrence v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1972] A.C. 626, [1971] 6 WLUK 101](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID7C32980E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=79ce7c2b7bc14dd88d4f3f984864f800&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Dobson v General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corp [1990] 1 Q.B. 274, [1989] 7 WLUK 368](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I998BBBA0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=79ce7c2b7bc14dd88d4f3f984864f800&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[R. v Morris (David Alan) [1984] A.C. 320, [1983] 10 WLUK 96](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5ABC0FF0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=79ce7c2b7bc14dd88d4f3f984864f800&contextData=(sc.Default))_ not applied).
