# R v Heard [2007] EWCA Crim 125

## Summary

The offence of sexual assault contrary to the [Sexual Offences Act 2003 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICE833F10E45211DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ae35740129054f27963d46e16650167a&contextData=(sc.Search)) required the sexual touching to be intentional or deliberate, and voluntary intoxication could not be relied upon to negate the necessary intention.

## Abstract

The appellant (H) appealed against his conviction for sexual assault contrary to the [Sexual Offences Act 2003 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICE833F10E45211DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ae35740129054f27963d46e16650167a&contextData=(sc.Search)) .

Police officers had been called to H's home where he was found drunk, in an emotional state and had cut himself. He requested to be taken to hospital for treatment where he became abusive and began to sing noisily in the waiting area. The police officers took H outside to wait where he would be less of a disturbance to others. Whilst outside, he began to dance suggestively to one of the officers (P) and put his hand on his own groin. H attempted to re-enter the hospital and when discouraged became angry, punching P in the stomach. H then undid his trousers, took his penis in his hand and rubbed it up and down on P's thigh. H was arrested. During interviews H stated that although he could not remember anything that had occurred, he accepted that when he was ill or intoxicated he was prone to being "silly and start stripping". At trial, prior to his summing up, the judge was asked to rule whether or not the offence was one to which voluntary drunkenness could afford a defence in the sense that it might prevent H from having the necessary state of mind. The judge ruled that the offence was one of basic intent as it had to be committed deliberately rather than accidentally in light of the use of "intentionally" in s.3(1)(a) of the Act, and that drunkenness could not be relied on as a defence. He directed the jury that the Crown had to prove that H had touched P deliberately.

H submitted that the judge erred in his ruling since the offence was one of specific intent as reckless touching would not suffice, and that the jury ought to have been directed to consider if his voluntary intoxication meant that he did not have the intention to touch P.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) It should not be supposed that every offence could be categorised simply as one of either specific or basic intent as that might conceal the truth that different elements of it might require proof of different states of mind. The instant offence was an example and the different elements of the offence as identified in s.3(a) to (d) did not call for proof of the same state of mind. It was of very limited help to try and label the offence as one particular type of intent because the state of mind that must be proved varied with the issue. However, on the evidence available, H plainly intended to touch P with his penis. That he was drunk could have meant that he was either disinhibited and did something that he would not ordinarily have done when sober, or that he did not remember it afterwards. Neither of those matters would destroy the intentional character of his touching P. A drunken intent was still an intent and H's behaviour, both in committing the offence and his interviews afterwards, made it clear that the touching had been deliberate. The judge had been correct in his direction to the jury on intent.

(2) It was not open to a defendant charged with sexual assault to contend that his voluntary intoxication prevented him from intending to touch, _[DPP v Majewski [1977] A.C. 443, [1976] 4 WLUK 71](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AF95560E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ae35740129054f27963d46e16650167a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. Historically the law of England regarded voluntary intoxication as an aggravation rather than a potential excuse and it was unlikely that Parliament had intended to change the law by permitting reliance on voluntary intoxication where it previously had not been permitted. There was no basis for construing the Act as having altered the law.
