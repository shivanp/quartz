# R v Wilson [1997] QB 47 (CA)

FACTS: The defendant used a hot knife to brand his initials onto the buttocks of his wife, at her request. He argued consent to a charge under the **OAPA 1861 s 47**, and was successful.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that there was no logical difference between this type of branding, tattooing, body piercing, and similar personal adornments, which is a lawful activity. This case forms an interesting contrast to the decision and _dicta_ in **_R v Brown._**

W appealed against conviction of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861 s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C0F52C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b225cdeb24ef4d4795ca7a599ceca601&contextData=(sc.Default)). He had branded his wife's buttocks with his own initials at her instigation and with her consent. W argued that the trial judge had erred in holding that he was bound by _[R. v Brown (Anthony Joseph) [1994] 1 A.C. 212, [1993] 3 WLUK 189](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38DEA0F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b225cdeb24ef4d4795ca7a599ceca601&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and in directing the jury to convict following the prosecution's case.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the trial judge was wrong to find that consent was irrelevant and was no defence to a charge under s.47 of the Act. The instant case involved no aggression or sado masochistic element, and the branding was carried out as a result of W's wife's request to have W's initials on her body as a physical adornment, R. v Brown and _[R. v Donovan (John George) [1934] 2 K.B. 498, [1934] 7 WLUK 52](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I423E87F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b225cdeb24ef4d4795ca7a599ceca601&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. The action taken by W could be equated with tattooing, which attracted no criminal sanction. Public policy considerations were relevant in determining what activity amounted to criminal behaviour and general propositions were inappropriate in a changing world. Each case should be decided on its own facts.
