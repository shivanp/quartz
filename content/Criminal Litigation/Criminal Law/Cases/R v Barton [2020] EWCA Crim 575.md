# R v Barton [2020] EWCA Crim 575

## Summary

The Court of Appeal affirmed that the test for dishonesty in the criminal context was that set out by the Supreme Court in Ivey v Genting Casinos UK Ltd (t/a Crockfords Club) [2017] UKSC 67, [2018] A.C. 391, [2017] 10 WLUK 580, expressly overruling _[R. v Ghosh (Deb Baran) [1982] Q.B. 1053, [1982] 4 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I472988A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d742cd04a374af0ada8ebf76aca0cf6&contextData=(sc.Search))_. The effect was that, in Ivey, the Supreme Court had altered the established common law approach to precedent in the criminal courts by stating that the test for dishonesty it had identified, albeit strictly contained in obiter dicta, should be followed in preference to an otherwise binding authority of the Court of Appeal.

## Abstract

The appellant (D) appealed against his convictions of conspiracy to defraud and against sentences totalling 21 years' imprisonment.

D ran a nursing home. Over 20 years, he dishonestly targeted and befriended elderly residents in order to profit from them. He manipulated them and isolated them from their friends, family and advisers. A number of wealthy residents made him the residuary beneficiary of their wills and gave him control of their financial affairs. D also accepted large gifts from the residents, who had capacity but were highly vulnerable. D claimed that the residents had made the gifts freely and had been professionally advised. The judge found that D had obtained £4,130,000 from the offences, which came to light when he brought a fabricated civil claim for £10 million against the estate of a deceased resident. At trial, the judge directed the jury on the issue of dishonesty by reference to the judgment in _[Ivey v Genting Casinos UK Ltd (t/a Crockfords Club) [2017] UKSC 67, [2018] A.C. 391, [2017] 10 WLUK 580](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0D169600B96C11E7A68BFC577B65FE9C/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d742cd04a374af0ada8ebf76aca0cf6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ rather than that in _[R. v Ghosh (Deb Baran) [1982] Q.B. 1053, [1982] 4 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I472988A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d742cd04a374af0ada8ebf76aca0cf6&contextData=(sc.Search))_. In doing so, he indicated that he had followed the Supreme Court's instruction that directions based on Ghosh should no longer be given. The Ghosh test was whether the defendant's conduct was dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable people, and if so whether they appreciated that their conduct was dishonest by those standards. The alternative test proposed by the Supreme Court in Ivey was, first, to determine the defendant's actual state of knowledge or belief as to the facts and, second, to ask whether their conduct was dishonest by the standards of ordinary decent people.

D submitted that Ghosh remained binding authority because the Supreme Court's observations in Ivey were obiter dicta and that, even applying the Ivey test, the convictions were unsafe because the judge had failed to direct the jury to ascertain their actual state of mind before considering the second part of the test. Relying on _[R. v James (Leslie) [2006] EWCA Crim 14, [2006] Q.B. 588, [2006] 1 WLUK 487](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I500DFE10E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d742cd04a374af0ada8ebf76aca0cf6&contextData=(sc.Search))_, the prosecution submitted that Ivey expressly overruled Ghosh and bound the instant court as to the meaning of dishonesty in the criminal context.

## Held

Appeal against conviction dismissed, appeal against sentence allowed.

**Dishonesty: rules of precedent** - The ordinary rules of precedent required the instant court to follow Supreme Court decisions. The undoubted reality was that, in Ivey, the Supreme Court had altered the established common law approach to precedent in the criminal courts by stating that the test for dishonesty it had identified, albeit strictly contained in obiter dicta, should be followed in preference to an otherwise binding authority of the Court of Appeal. It was not for the latter court to conclude that it was beyond the Supreme Court's powers to act in that way, James considered. The rules of precedent existed to provide legal certainty, which was a foundation of the administration of justice and the rule of law. They ensured order and predictability, whilst allowing for the development of the law in well-understood circumstances. They did not form a code which existed for its own sake, but had to be capable of flexibility where appropriate to ensure that they did not become self-defeating. Where the Supreme Court itself directed that an otherwise binding decision of the Court of Appeal should no longer be followed and proposed an alternative test that it said had to be adopted, that amounted to a direction that the Court of Appeal was bound to follow even though it was strictly obiter. To that limited extent, the ordinary rules of precedent had been modified, provided that all the judges in the Supreme Court appeal agreed that to be the effect of the decision as they did in the instant case. Therefore, the test for dishonesty in all criminal cases was that established in Ivey. Taking the summing-up as a whole, and consistently with Ivey, the jury could have been left in no doubt that, when applying the objective standard of dishonesty, it should do so by reference to its findings about the state of D's knowledge or belief (see paras [102-105, 114, 116](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

**Conspiracy to defraud** - For the offence to be made out, there had to be a dishonest agreement which included unlawfulness, either as to the object of the agreement or the means by which it would be carried out, _[R. v Evans (Eric) [2014] 1 W.L.R. 2817, [2014] 2 WLUK 547](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I4A223290A58711E38B8BF644C445FA6D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d742cd04a374af0ada8ebf76aca0cf6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ approved. It was not necessary to prove an intent to deceive or to cause economic or financial loss to the victim, _[R. v H [2015] EWCA Crim 46, [2015] 1 WLUK 385](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I83DCB8B0564911E58680874258D3F4AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7d742cd04a374af0ada8ebf76aca0cf6&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. In the instant case, the necessary element of unlawfulness was the positive and extensive deceit practised on the victims with the intention of obtaining property to which D was not entitled. The jury had been reminded of the elements of the offences, as set out in the indictment, and there was no doubt that it understood the requirement for the prosecution to establish that there was a dishonest agreement on D's part, by deceit or lies, to prejudice the victims' proprietary rights or interests (paras [121, 123, 126](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Sentence** - The judge had correctly identified the appropriate category for each offence and the individual sentences were not manifestly excessive. The case was exceptional and involved a high level of exploitative criminality targeted at vulnerable elderly individuals. A long overall sentence of imprisonment was undoubtedly merited. There were multiple victims over a long period and the offences entailed a substantial breach of trust, coupled with financial abuse and dishonesty, using sophisticated devices. The sums illegally obtained ran into the millions. However, 21 years was manifestly excessive for a 64-year-old man of previous good character. Accordingly, the sentence was reduced to 17 years (paras [158-161](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
