# Tuberville v Savage (1669) 1 Mod Rep 3

The defendant placed his hand on his sword and said, 'If it were not assize-time, I would not take such language from you'. The action of putting his hand on the sword was threatening but was found to be negated by his words, which clearly implied that no physical action would be taken because the judges were in the vicinity.

Ultimately all depends on whether the victim apprehended immediate unlawful personal violence.

If X comes across Y in a dark alleyway and Y says ‘If you were not such a tiny squirt, I would punch your face in’. X may well apprehend immediate unlawful personal violence and Y would have committed the actus reus of assault.
