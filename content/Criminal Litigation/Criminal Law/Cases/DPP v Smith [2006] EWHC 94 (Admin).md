# DPP v Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin)

FACTS: Here the defendant, Mr Smith, cut off his estranged girlfriend's ponytail and some further hair from the top of her head. It was argued on behalf of Mr Smith that this act did not amount to 'actual bodily harm', in accordance with the legal definition provided in **_Miller_**, and as there was no evidence to suggest that this act had caused the victim psychiatric or psychological harm, there was no case to answer.

HELD: Despite the fact that the defendant’s actions left no mark on the body or break of the skin, and that essentially he had cut 'dead tissue', it was still part of the body, which by cutting had amounted to an assault. As Sir Igor Judge stated:

> 'Even if, medically and scientifically speaking, the hair above the surface of the scalp is no more than dead tissue, it remains part of the body and is attached to it. While it is so attached … it falls within the meaning of “bodily” in the phrase “actual bodily harm”. It is concerned with the body of the individual victim.’

## Summary

The cutting of hair without an individual's consent constituted an offence under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 of assault causing actual bodily harm.

## Abstract

The appellant (DPP) appealed by way of case stated against a ruling of no case to answer made by the magistrates court on a charge against the respondent (S) of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861 s.47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C0F52C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=97e07d327eab4139a74e4976ce127e22&contextData=(sc.Default)). The harm alleged was the cutting off of the victim's ponytail, plus some other hair from the top of her head. The justices accepted S's submission that cutting a person's hair could amount to no more than common assault, with which S had not been charged, because neither the change in appearance that it caused, nor the victim's distress, amounted to bodily harm in the absence of any bruising, bleeding or cutting of the skin. The DPP argued that bruising or bleeding or was not necessary, and that bodily harm, construed according to its ordinary meaning, meant any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the victim's health or comfort.

Held, allowing the appeal, that "harm", in ordinary language, was not limited to injury, but extended to hurt or damage. Moreover, actual bodily harm was not limited to the victim's skin, flesh and bones, but applied to all parts of the body, _[R. v Chan-Fook (Mike) [1994] 1 W.L.R. 689, [1993] 10 WLUK 234](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3A1A0720E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=97e07d327eab4139a74e4976ce127e22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. Evidence of external bodily injury, or a bruise or break to the skin, was not a necessary ingredient, and nor was physical pain consequent upon the assault, _[R. v Ireland (Robert Matthew) [1998] A.C. 147, [1997] 7 WLUK 529](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I4DA7AC70E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=97e07d327eab4139a74e4976ce127e22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The hair was an attribute and part of the human body, and, while attached to it, it fell within the meaning of "bodily" in the phrase "actual bodily harm". It followed that cutting off a substantial amount of a victim's hair in the course of an assault was capable of amounting to an assault occasioning bodily harm.
