# R v Hopley (1860) 2 F & F 202

A schoolmaster, on the second day after a boy’s return to school, wrote to the parent proposing to beat him severely to subdue his alleged obstinacy, and on receiving the father’s reply, assenting, beat the boy for two hours and a half secretly, in the night, and with a thick stick, until he died: Held he was liable to a charge of manslaughter.  

  

A parent or a schoolmaster, who for this purpose represents the parent and has the parental authority delegated to him, may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable. If it be administered for the gratification of passion or of rage, or if it be immoderate and excessive in its nature or degree, or if it be protracted beyond the child’s powers of endurance, or with an instrument unfitted for the purpose and calculated to produce danger to life or limb; in all such cases the punishment is excessive, the violence is unlawful and if evil consequence to life or limb ensue, then the person inflicting it is answerable to the law, and if death ensues it will be manslaughter (Cockburn, CJ).
