# R v Mitchell and King [1999] Crim LR 496

FACTS: A fight broke out in a restaurant in which A, B and D assaulted two customers and damaged the restaurant on their way out. They were followed out by the owner and his two sons. The fight continued outside the restaurant, during which the victim was left on the ground. D returned to beat the victim further and killed him.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that communication of withdrawal was required only in cases of pre-planned violence, not a case like the one before them. Otton LJ said:

> ‘Communication of withdrawal is a necessary condition for dissociation from pre-planned violence. It is not necessary when the violence is spontaneous. Although absent any communication, it may, as a matter of evidence, be easier to persuade a jury that a defendant, who had previously participated, had not in fact withdrawn. Such considerations are clearly relevant in such cases [i.e. of pre-planned violence], but less so when the violence has erupted spontaneously.’
