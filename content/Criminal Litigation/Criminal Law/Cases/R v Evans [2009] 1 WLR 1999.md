# R v Evans [2009] 1 WLR 1999

FACTS: Gemma Evans, a 24-year-old woman, purchased heroin and supplied her 16-year-old sister, Carly. Carly self-injected in a house in which she resided with Evans and her mother (Andrea Townsend). After injecting the drug, she developed and complained of symptoms consistent with an overdose. Gemma Evans and Andrea Townsend were also heroin addicts, they knew the signs of an overdose and were fully aware of the dangers involved. They appreciated that Carly's condition was very serious and indicative of an overdose. Evans said that she had seen that Carly's lips had turned blue, that she was 'in a mess', and was incapable of responding to attempts to speak to her.

Evans and Townsend decided not to seek medical assistance because they feared that they themselves and possibly Carly would get into trouble. Instead, they put Carly in bed with the hope that she would make a miraculous recovery. Although the women slept in the same room and checked on Carly occasionally, Carly died during the night. The medical evidence demonstrated that the cause of death was heroin poisoning. Evans and her mother were charged with gross negligence manslaughter.

Evans appealed against her conviction for gross negligence manslaughter. It was argued by the defence team that the case should have been withdrawn from the jury because the Crown failed to establish that Evans owed the victim a duty of care.

HELD: The mother was convicted on the basis of her ‘familial duty or responsibility which marked her relationship with the deceased’ and which required her to take responsible steps to summon assistance for her young daughter once she realised she was critically ill and in need of urgent medical attention. Since Evans was an older half-sister, the court decided that she did not come within the purview of the familial duty doctrine. An adult sibling is not regarded as the constructive guardian of younger siblings.

However, the Court of Appeal held that Evans had a duty of care because she had created a dangerous situation and failed to do anything to remedy it. This overlooks the fact that Evans's sister created the dangerous situation by making the independent choice to self-inject. In effect, Evans was convicted on the grounds that she had helped her sister to create a dangerous situation for herself by supplying her with deadly drugs, she was aware that her sister's act of self-injection had put her in peril and she failed to summon help when she was in a position to do so.
