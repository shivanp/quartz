# R v Giannetto [1997] 1 Cr App R 1

G appealed against conviction of murder, contending that, since the Crown's case was that G either murdered his wife himself or encouraged another to carry out the killing, the trial judge was wrong not to have directed the jury as to the need for unanimity on one of those alternatives.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that whilst it was necessary for a jury to find each essential element of an offence proved, _[R. v Brown (Kevin) (1984) 1 B.C.C. 98970, [1983] 12 WLUK 32](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38EECD91E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=946b2b893f5e448eb3a00a1f6b804666&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered, it was open to the jury in the instant case, where the Crown was unable to say whether G committed murder in a principal or secondary capacity, to convict if they were agreed that G had the requisite mens rea and caused the end result, by whatever means. Provided the jury were agreed that G was guilty on that basis and that G knew what case he had to meet, it did not matter if some jurors believed that G had carried out the killing whilst others were satisfied only that he encouraged it, _Thatcher v Queen, The (1987) 39 D.L.R. (4th) 275_ considered.
