# R v Klass [1998] 1 Cr App R 453

FACTS: K and two other men, one of whom had a piece of pole in his hand, wrenched open the door of a caravan and demanded money from the occupant. The occupant ran out of the caravan. Once outside, the occupant was repeatedly assaulted with the pole by one of the accomplices. There was no evidence that this accomplice with the pole ever went inside the building. K then entered the caravan without the pole and committed burglary. He was convicted of aggravated burglary.

HELD: The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the grounds that there was no entry into the building with a weapon.

K and two other men, one of whom had a piece of pole in his hand, burgled a caravan after opening the door and demanding money from the occupant who was then struck repeatedly with the pole as he ran away. K was convicted of aggravated burglary contrary to the [Theft Act 1968 s.10](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6B4B61E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e6f08d36d07749678f00a03a09258662&contextData=(sc.Default)) and appealed on the ground that the elements of the offence had not been made out as the man carrying the pole had never entered the caravan.

Held, allowing the appeal, that if the weapon was carried by a person who remained on the outside of the building being burgled, that person could be convicted of burglary if he was aiding and abetting the offence being committed inside the building and therefore, on a strict interpretation of s.10, the person outside the building and those inside could all be convicted of aggravated burglary. However, the purpose of s.10 was to discourage offenders from carrying weapons while committing burglary and a purposive approach to s.10 demanded that the burglar or one of the burglars have a weapon with him at the time of entry to the building. On the facts, there was no evidence that the pole had entered the caravan and the conviction would therefore be quashed and a conviction of burglary substituted.
