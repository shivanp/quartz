# R v Hood [2004] 1 Cr App R (S) 431

HELD: D was held to be liable for the manslaughter of his wife who died as a result of broken bones suffered three weeks earlier after a fall. D had failed to summon medical assistance to help her. The basis of his liability, it seems, stemmed from his relationship with her, based on marriage.
