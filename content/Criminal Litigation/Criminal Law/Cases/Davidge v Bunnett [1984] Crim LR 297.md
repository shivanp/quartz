# Davidge v Bunnett [1984] Crim LR 297

FACTS: The defendant shared a flat with others. They all shared the costs of bills. On receipt of a gas bill for the sum of £159.75, the defendant was given cheques to the value of £109.75 towards the cost of the bill, to which she was expected to add the outstanding £50.00. The defendant cashed the cheques and spent the money on Christmas presents. She was convicted of theft. The Queen's Bench Bench Division held that she was under a legal obligation to apply the proceeds of the cheques to the payment of the gas bill.

HELD: The defendant's conviction for theft was upheld. This case confirms that obligations can be imposed upon domestic/social arrangements.

D, C, McF and H shared a flat. The gas account was in C's name. D, C and McF agreed to pay GBP 50 each towards a gas bill of GBP 159.75 and H GBP 9.75. C, McF and H gave D cheques payable to D's employer (D had no bank account). The intention was that D should encash the cheques and pay the bill or that her employers would write out a cheque to the Gas Board on receiving the money. D encashed C's and McF's cheques and spent the money on Christmas presents.

Held, dismissing D's appeal against conviction of theft of the proceeds of the cheques, that D was under an obligation to use the cheques or their proceeds as she saw fit so long as they were applied pro tanto to the discharge of the bill. The magistrates' finding that D was not obliged to use the actual banknotes meant only that. She was under an obligation to use the notes in a particular way and as against D the proceeds of the cheques were property belonging to another within the [Theft Act 1968 s.5(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6753C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=18df77fef2654053a4b4bc69c6cf8db3&contextData=(sc.Default)) .
