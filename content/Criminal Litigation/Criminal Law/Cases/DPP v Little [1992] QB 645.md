# DPP v Little [1992] QB 645

The offences of common assault and battery are separate statutory offences contrary to the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and are triable summarily regardless of whether the information is laid by or on behalf of the victim. In two appeals the question arose whether the offences of common assault and battery were statutory offences and how they should be charged. In the first case justices dismissed a charge of assault on a named person contrary to s.39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as the named victim had neither authorised nor laid the information. The second information, alleging assault and battery, was dismissed as being bad for duplicity as common assault and battery were two distinct offences under s.39.

Held, allowing the first appeal and dismissing the second, that common assault and battery were two separate offences, both of which should be charged as being contrary to s.39 of the 1988 Act. The Offences against the Person Act 1861 had made the previously common-law offences of assault and battery into statutory offences. Where there was actual, as well as apprehended, unlawful force the charge should read assault by beating, not assault and battery, which alleged two different offences. Since s.39 meant that all common assaults and all batteries were triable summarily regardless of who laid the information, the first appeal would be allowed but the information in the second case was bad for duplicity.
