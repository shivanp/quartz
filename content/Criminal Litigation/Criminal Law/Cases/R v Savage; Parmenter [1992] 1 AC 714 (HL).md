# R v Savage; Parmenter [1992] 1 AC 714 (HL)

The appellant (S), had been charged with unlawful and malicious wounding following an incident in a public house where a glass of beer had been thrown over the former girlfriend of S's husband. The glass had broken and the girl was hurt. S contended that she did not throw the glass. The jury convicted her of unlawful wounding following the recorder's summing up in which he omitted to state that "malice" meant that S must have foreseen that some physical violence would result from her act, _[R. v Mowatt (Sidney Linton) [1968] 1 Q.B. 421, [1967] 6 WLUK 66](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5ADD2C80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2362f4e6ea794de59aa9e3bbcd9f157a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ .

Held, that the test implied by the term "malice" was subjective not objective and the conviction was therefore quashed. The point then arose as to whether it was possible to substitute the alternative verdicts of common assault or assault occasioning actual bodily harm. After this appeal had been heard, judgment had been given in R. v Mearns Times, May 4, 1990 in which it had been decided that since the [Criminal Justice Act 1988 s.40](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5C283530E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2362f4e6ea794de59aa9e3bbcd9f157a&contextData=(sc.Default)) came into force, common assault was no longer a possible verdict at a trial on indictment. The same was not so of assault occasioning actual bodily harm which was an indictable offence. S's action of throwing beer over the complainant constituted both an assault and a battery in law and this verdict would be substituted for that of unlawful wounding.
