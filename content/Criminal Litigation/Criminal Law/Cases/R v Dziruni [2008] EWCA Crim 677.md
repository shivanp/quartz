# R v Dziruni [2008] EWCA Crim 677

## Summary

It was not a sufficient ground for departing from the guidance offered by _[R. v Kolawole (David Oladotun) [2004] EWCA Crim 3047, [2005] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 14, [2004] 11 WLUK 307](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I51752F30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b705f9dbf003442d906675e1d6a40904&contextData=(sc.Default))_, and the pattern of sentencing decisions of the Court of Appeal for offences of possessing false identity documents with intent, that the offender was in dual detention and was shortly to be deported.

## Abstract

The Solicitor General applied for leave to refer to the court as unduly lenient sentences imposed on the offenders (L and D) for offences of possessing false identity documents with intent.

Both had pleaded guilty to the offences. L was sentenced to concurrent terms of four months' imprisonment, and D was given a suspended sentence of six months' imprisonment with a requirement that he perform 80 hours of unpaid work. L was acting as a courier of three false identities in an operation to evade immigration control. The sentencing judge noted that the Home Office intended shortly to deport L, and found that it was in the public interest for the sentence to be much lower than normal for that reason. D had come to the United Kingdom from Zimbabwe as an asylum seeker in 2004, whereupon his application for asylum was refused. In 2005 and 2006 there were campaigns to persuade the government that failed asylum seekers from Zimbabwe should not be returned. D renewed his application for asylum in 2006, but received no response from the Home Office.

D believed that he had no entitlement to any form of funding or support: in fact he was entitled to Â£35 per week. In June 2007 he bought false documentation in order to obtain employment. He had been in continuous employment, performing menial work, since July 2007. It was a condition of D's ability to remain in the UK that he should not work. The sentencing judge found that D was otherwise a decent, hard-working person and treated his case as "a very limited class of case" of people "in limbo", who were permitted to live in the UK and endured living here because they could not be sent back to their home country.

The Solicitor General argued that both sentences were unduly lenient and the judges had failed to apply the guidelines in _[R. v Kolawole (David Oladotun) [2004] EWCA Crim 3047, [2005] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 14, [2004] 11 WLUK 307](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I51752F30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b705f9dbf003442d906675e1d6a40904&contextData=(sc.Default))_.

## Held

References allowed in part.

(1) Deterrent sentences were plainly required for persons in possession of false passports intent on acts of terrorism. Even if those in possession of false passports did not intend them for terrorism, heavy sentences were still required since they might have the effect of assisting terrorism. More often, as in L's case, the offence would be related to activities designed to undermine immigration control. For such cases Kolawole continued to provide guidance for sentencing judges, Kolawole applied. The judge in L's case had allowed himself to be over-influenced by the fact that L was on his immediate way out of the UK, as soon as he had finished his prison sentence. He had approached the case on the basis that, given the problems with prison overcrowding, it was better to get L out of the UK quickly rather than inflict the cost of keeping him in the country on the tax-paying public. That approach overlooked the need to make it clear that those who were caught entering the UK in possession of false passports, or in possession of false passports which would be used to facilitate the unlawful entry or unlawful presence of others, merited the element of deterrence in sentences referred to in Kolawole. It was not a sufficient deterrence if the penalty was a very short period of incarceration followed by a quick return journey home. The sentence imposed on L was unduly lenient and was replaced with a sentence of 12 months' imprisonment.

(2) D's sentence was not lenient at all: it was merciful, in a case where the exercise of the judicial quality of mercy was entirely appropriate. Suspending D's sentence and requiring him to do some work for the country would sufficiently punish him and offer practical value to the community. The Solicitor General's application for leave was refused.
