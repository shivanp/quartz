# R v Brennan [2014] EWCA Crim 2387

FACTS: In this case Brennan had been convicted of murder despite a psychiatristâ€™s evidence that all the elements of the test had been satisfied. Her evidence had not been contradicted.

HELD: Davies LJ, in overturning the conviction, held that a judge should withdraw the murder charge from the jury when either the expert medical evidence is uncontested or when there is no other evidence which is capable of rebutting the medical evidence. It was held to be legitimate and helpful for expert psychiatrists to give evidence.

All four of the elements of the defence are concerned with psychiatric matters.

## Summary

Where there was unchallenged medical evidence of diminished responsibility and no other evidence which, looked at in the round, was at least capable of rebutting the defence, the trial judge should withdraw a charge of murder from the jury.

## Abstract

The appellant (B) appealed against his conviction for murder.

B, who was 22 at the time, had been working as a male escort. He brutally killed one of his clients. B had had personality and mental health issues since childhood. The only issue at trial was his defence of diminished responsibility. The evidence adduced in support of that defence was from a consultant forensic psychiatrist (M). Her opinion was firmly in support of the defence and was not contradicted by any expert evidence adduced by the Crown, which called no expert evidence at all in that regard. Nevertheless, the jury convicted B of murder.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) Where there was unchallenged medical evidence of diminished responsibility and no other evidence which, looked at in the round, was at least capable of rebutting the defence, the trial judge should withdraw a charge of murder from the jury. This was such a case. The Crown had sought to identify matters which were capable of displacing the uncontradicted opinion of M. It relied, among other things, on admitted evidence of planning and premeditation. However, all of those matters had been addressed by M in the course of her evidence. She explained unequivocally and rationally why in her opinion they did not displace the defence of diminished responsibility. Further, no expert was called by the Crown to say to the jury that such matters might not be consistent with diminished responsibility. In the circumstances, B's conviction was unsafe and a verdict of manslaughter should be substituted, _[R. v Matheson (Albert Edward) [1958] 1 W.L.R. 474, [1958] 4 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I57094120E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=dfb1bf1945a54ffbaff64fba9cd9725d&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[R. v Bailey (Rodney William) (1978) 66 Cr. App. R. 31, [1961] 10 WLUK 85](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I32C9ED50E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=dfb1bf1945a54ffbaff64fba9cd9725d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Pearce (Barry) [2000] 3 WLUK 47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60557910E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=dfb1bf1945a54ffbaff64fba9cd9725d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered (see paras [3, 65, 69-70](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) B's case seemed to be the first of its kind to come before the appellate court in the context of a defence of diminished responsibility under the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=dfb1bf1945a54ffbaff64fba9cd9725d&contextData=(sc.Default)) as amended. The new wording of s.2 gave significantly more scope to the importance of expert psychiatric evidence. There was now essentially a four-stage test: whether the defendant was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning; if so, whether it had arisen from a recognised medical condition; if so, whether it had substantially impaired his ability either to understand the nature of his conduct or to form a rational judgment or to exercise self-control (or any combination); if so, whether it provided an explanation for his conduct. The new provisions were significantly more structured than the former provisions. Most, if not all, of the aspects of the new provisions related entirely to psychiatric matters. It would be both legitimate and helpful for an expert psychiatrist to include in his evidence a view on all four stages, including a view as to whether there was substantial impairment. Moreover, where he was able to and did express a view on all four matters, there could be no objection to his making explicit his opinion on the "ultimate issue", the more so when such view would probably have been implicit from his stated opinion on the four matters. Where the Crown proposed to contest a defence of diminished responsibility, the new provisions should be taken as an encouragement for it to adduce its own expert evidence to support its stance. Further, if there were other facts or circumstances which might cast a different light on otherwise uncontradicted defence expert medical evidence and the matter was to be left to the jury, one would expect those facts and circumstances to be highlighted by prosecuting counsel in discussion with the judge before closing speeches and in due course specifically identified to the jury by the judge in the summing-up (paras [2, 49-51, 67-68](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
