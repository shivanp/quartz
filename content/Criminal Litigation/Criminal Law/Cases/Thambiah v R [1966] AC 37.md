# Thambiah v R [1966] AC 37

If A helps B to prepare for a crime of a certain kind with the intention that B shall commit such a crime and B does so, A may be guilty of aiding and abetting it. A took great pains to open a bank account for B under a false name with the intention that B should afterwards pass a forged cheque through it, which B afterwards did. This all happened in Ceylon and evidence was given at his trial that A admitted to the police while in custody that he had practised a particular signature for the purpose.

Held, that A was guilty of aiding and abetting B's fraud on the bank and, though the Ceylon Civil Procedure Code s.122(3 ) forbade evidence of any statement to the police at any time during the investigation, yet the evidence in the present case did not affect the verdict and A's conviction of aiding and abetting should stand.
