# Johnson v DPP [1994] Crim LR 673

FACTS: Johnson, a squatter in a council house, damaged a door while attempting to fit locks in the house. Johnson was charged with criminal damage and raised the **CDA 1971, section 5(2)(b)** defence on the grounds that there had been a high number of thefts in the area, and that he had therefore acted to protect his property.

HELD: The Queen's Bench Division upheld his conviction on the grounds that he did not believe his property was in **immediate** need of protection.
