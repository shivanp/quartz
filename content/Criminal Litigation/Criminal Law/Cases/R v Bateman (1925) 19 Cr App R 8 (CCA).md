# R v Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 (CCA)

Where a doctor is consulted, as possessing medical skill and knowledge, by or on behalf of a patient, he owes a duty to that patient to use due caution in undertaking the treatment. If he accepts the responsibility and undertakes the treatment and the patient submits to his direction and treatment accordingly, he owes a duty to the patient to use a fair and reasonable degree of diligence, care, knowledge, skill, and caution in administering the treatment. To support an indictment for the manslaughter of a patient, however, the prosecution must satisfy the jury that the negligence or incompetence of the doctor went beyond a mere matter of compensation and showed such disregard for the life and safety of the patient as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment.
