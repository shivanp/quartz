# R v Martin (Anthony) [2002] Crim LR 136

Mr Martin, having suffered a number of burglaries at his isolated farmhouse in Norfolk, decided to take matters into his own hands. He had placed various security measures/booby traps around his property and then shot at two suspected burglars, who had entered his farmhouse during the night, with his pump-action shot gun. One of the victims (16-year-old Fred Barras) died. Mr Martin pleaded self-defence at his trial, but was unsuccessful due to the excessive force used. However, a defence may now be available under loss of control using a fear of serious violence as a qualifying trigger.

## Summary

Save in exceptional circumstances, a defendant could not rely on the fact that he had been suffering from a psychiatric condition when arguing that he had used reasonable force in self-defence.

## Abstract

M appealed against his conviction for murder. M had shot two people engaged in burgling his home, killing one and wounding the other. At trial he unsuccessfully raised the defence of self defence. Following conviction, M was found by a psychiatrist to be suffering from a longstanding paranoid personality disorder. M contended that his psychiatric illness had affected his perception of the risk posed to his safety by the burglars, and that it was relevant in determining whether the amount of force he used was reasonable in the circumstances. M relied on _[R. v Smith (Morgan James) [2001] 1 A.C. 146, [2000] 7 WLUK 820](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6A351760E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6b88f262e060451780846530d1a94715&contextData=(sc.Default))_ in which it had be found that the jury was entitled to take into account a characteristic which affected the degree of self control reasonably expected of a defendant in a case involving provocation, contending that the same approach applied in the case of self defence to the use of reasonable force.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that the defences of provocation and self-defence were distinguishable. Whilst a defendant could, for the purposes of provocation, rely on the fact he was suffering from a psychiatric condition which affected the degree of control that could reasonably be expected of him, it could not, save in exceptional circumstances, be relied upon when arguing that he had used reasonable force in self defence, R. v Smith (Morgan James) distinguished. However, it was accepted that a defendant's physical characteristics could be taken into account. In the light of fresh evidence relating to diminished responsibility, the conviction for murder was quashed and a conviction for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility was substituted, with a sentence of five years' imprisonment.
