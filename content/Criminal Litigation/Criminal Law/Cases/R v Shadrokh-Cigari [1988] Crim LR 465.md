# R v Shadrokh-Cigari [1988] Crim LR 465

FACTS: The defendant was the legal guardian of his nephew. A bank mistakenly credited the child's account with £286,000 instead of £286. At the defendant's request, the child signed an authority for the issue of four separate banker's drafts. The defendant withdrew the majority of the money, and he was subsequently convicted of theft.

HELD: The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction on the ground that, although legal title in the money may have passed to the accused on delivery, the bank retained an equitable interest in the property that the accused had stolen under the **Theft Act 1968, s 5(1)**.

A U.S. bank credited D's ward's bank account in England with USD286,000 by mistake instead of USD286. D got his ward to draw banker's drafts in his favour to the extent of most of the money, which he then misappropriated. He was convicted of theft of the banker's drafts. On appeal, D argued that the jury should have been directed that they must be satisfied that the drafts belonged to the bank before convicting and that in fact they had belonged to him.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that it was wrong to assume that the English bank was left with no rights in the drafts. It retained an equitable proprietary interest as a result of the mistake which amounted to property within the [Theft Act 1968 s.5(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF6753C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ea5ed9ec84e64767b9eeeda97307a760&contextData=(sc.Default))(_[Kelly v Solari 152 E.R. 24, [1841] 11 WLUK 103](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF64277E0E57011DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ea5ed9ec84e64767b9eeeda97307a760&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
