# A-G v Able [1984] QB 795

The civil court will only grant a declaration that a future course of conduct is criminal where there is no risk that the declaration would treat as criminal conduct which was not clearly criminal. The distribution of a booklet dealing with suicide would not, in certain circumstances, be criminal and hence the declaration would be refused. D and others published a booklet on the subject of suicide; they believed that it gave no encouragement to persons reading it to commit suicide. The Attorney General took a different view, but wished to avoid prosecuting them for offences under s.2 of the 1961 Act because their beliefs were wholly genuine and all were respectable persons. He applied, accordingly, for a declaration that distribution of the booklet could constitute a criminal offence under the [Suicide Act 1961 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8B9E3330E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8092e13906ef482e974833beba9bad00&contextData=(sc.Default)) .

Held, refusing the declaration, that (1) the civil court must be wary of trespassing on the jurisdiction of the criminal court and of usurping the functions of judge and jury. A declaration regarding the criminality of future conduct would only, therefore, be granted where the Attorney General established clearly that there was no risk of conduct so declared to be criminal not in fact being criminal; (2) to prove the offence under s.2 it had to be shown that D and the others had aided and abetted, counselled or procured the suicide or attempted suicide of another. There could well be circumstances in which the distribution of the booklet did not amount to such in law - it might be required for genuine research, or indeed play no part at all in any eventual suicide.
