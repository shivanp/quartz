# R v Turner (No 2) [1971] 1 WLR 901

FACTS: The defendant took his car to a local garage. He later contacted the mechanic to check if the car was ready and was told that it was. The defendant took the car using his spare keys without paying the bill. He was convicted of theft and appealed.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the mechanic was in possession and control of the car and, therefore, the car did 'belong to another'.
