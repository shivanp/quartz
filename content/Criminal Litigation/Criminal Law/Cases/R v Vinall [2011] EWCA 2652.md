# R v Vinall [2011] EWCA 2652

In this case, force was used against two victims during a fight and a bike was taken by the defendants as an afterthought and then left abandoned. It was held that where an intention to permanently deprive is formed at a later point in time than force is used, there would not have been a theft at the time the force was used and therefore no conviction for robbery.

## Summary

The necessary intention within the [Theft Act 1968 s.6(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0def12d7c8754119925d10403b031e3a&contextData=(sc.Search)) could be demonstrated at the time of the taking of property or when it was later abandoned, but an intention formed only at the time of abandonment could not support a conviction for robbery.

## Abstract

The appellants appealed against their convictions for robbery.

A young man (D) and his friend had been riding along a cycle path when they came across the appellants and another youth. One of the appellants punched D from his bicycle and told him he had a knife. They then chased D and took his bicycle. They were caught by the police not far away and D's bicycle was found at a bus shelter nearby. The judge found that there was sufficient evidence to be left to the jury of a joint enterprise to steal the bicycle, of a connection between the violence and the taking and dishonest appropriation with intent either permanently to deprive the owner or to treat the bicycle as their own to dispose of regardless of the owner's rights under the [Theft Act 1968 s.6(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0def12d7c8754119925d10403b031e3a&contextData=(sc.Search)).

The appellants submitted that

(1) the judge was wrong to rule that there was sufficient evidence from which it could be inferred that aggressive and violent behaviour was used in order to achieve the theft of the bicycle;

(2) section 6 had no application and the judge's direction based on a later disposal of the bicycle was wrong.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) The judge was clearly entitled to rule that there was a case to answer in respect of an offence of robbery based upon evidence of the circumstances of the taking (see para.[7](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) Section 6(1) was expressed in general terms and was not limited in its application to common law exceptions existing prior to the 1968 Act, _[R. v Fernandes (Roland Anthony) [1996] 1 Cr. App. R. 175, [1995] 4 WLUK 199](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I437E5AF0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0def12d7c8754119925d10403b031e3a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed. What s.6(1) required was a state of mind in the defendant which Parliament regarded as the equivalent of an intention permanently to deprive, namely "his intention to treat the thing as his own to dispose of regardless of the other's rights". The subsection did not require that the thing had been disposed of, nor that the defendant intended to dispose of it in a particular way. Evidence of a particular disposal or a particular intention to dispose of the thing would constitute evidence of the defendant's state of mind but it was for the jury to decide on the circumstances proved whether the defendant harboured the statutory intention. If the prosecution was unable to establish an intention permanently to deprive at the moment of taking it could nevertheless establish that the defendant exercised such a dominion over the property that it could be inferred that at the time of the taking he intended to treat the property as his own to dispose of regardless of the owner's rights. Subsequent disposal of the property could be evidence either of an intention at the time of the taking or evidence of an intention at the time of the disposal, _Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset v Smith unreported_considered (paras [16, 19](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The judge wrongly left to the jury the option of concluding that the act of theft was completed not at the time of taking but at the time of abandonment. If the charge had been theft only, and the jury were not sure that at the moment of taking the bicycle the appellants dishonestly appropriated it with intent, actual or deemed, permanently to deprive, they could next consider whether there was a later appropriation at the time of the abandonment. However, if the theft was committed only at the moment of abandonment the prosecution case of robbery was fatally undermined because it was not proved that force or the threat of force was used before or at the time of and in order to steal. It would have been open to the judge to invite the jury to consider whether the later abandonment of D's bicycle was evidence from which they could infer that the appellants intended at the time of the taking to treat the bicycle as their own to dispose of regardless of his rights. If that was the way the judge had chosen to leave the issue of intention to the jury, an explicit direction would have been required explaining that an intention formed only upon abandonment of the bicycle at the bus shelter was inconsistent with and fatal to the allegation of robbery. In the absence of such an explanation, the verdicts were unsafe and were quashed (paras [11-14, 20](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs"))
