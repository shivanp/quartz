# R v Golds [2016] UKSC 61

## Summary

The Supreme Court clarified the meaning of "substantially" in relation to the partial defence of diminished responsibility set out in the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa7d864557a4fa1b2cc63a041e4c423&contextData=(sc.Search)), which required an abnormality of mental functioning which, among other things, substantially impaired the defendant's ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control. The court also set out how juries should be directed on the issue.

## Abstract

The appellant (G) appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal dismissing his appeal against his conviction for the murder of his partner.

G had admitted the killing. The sole issue at his trial had been whether he had made out the partial defence of diminished responsibility and so fell to be convicted of manslaughter rather than murder. The psychiatric evidence was to the effect that G suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition. As to whether, for the purposes of the [Homicide Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7809FE30E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa7d864557a4fa1b2cc63a041e4c423&contextData=(sc.Search)), that abnormality had substantially impaired his ability to understand the nature of his conduct, form a rational judgment or exercise self-control, the trial judge directed the jury that "substantially" was an everyday word which did not require elucidation. The jury rejected the defence of diminished responsibility.

Before the Court of Appeal, G argued that the judge should have directed the jury that the "substantially impaired" test would be met if the impairment was more than merely trivial. The Court of Appeal rejected that submission, holding that the judge had been correct to direct the jury as he had.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

As a matter of dictionary definition, "substantial" was capable of meaning either "present rather than illusory or fanciful, thus having some substance" or "important or weighty". A review of the authorities clearly showed that in the context of diminished responsibility the word "substantially" had always been held to be used in the second of those senses. It was **not** synonymous with "anything more than merely trivial". There was no basis for thinking that when the same expression was carried forward into the new formulation of diminished responsibility, when s.2 was revised by the [Coroners and Justice Act 2009](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I69823050DA4211DEB7FDF517E142DA0B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3aa7d864557a4fa1b2cc63a041e4c423&contextData=(sc.Search)), any change of sense was intended. The adverb "substantially" was applied now, as before, to the verb "impaired".

In the absence of any indication to the contrary, Parliament was to be taken to have adopted the established sense in which the word "substantially" had been used for 50 years. That use of the word accorded with principle. It was just that where a substantial impairment was shown, the defendant would be convicted of the lesser offence and not of murder. But it was appropriate for the reduction to the lesser offence to be occasioned where there was a weighty reason for it and not merely a reason which just passed the trivial. Ordinarily in a murder trial where diminished responsibility was in issue, the judge need not direct the jury beyond the terms of the statute and should not attempt to define the meaning of "substantially".

Experience had shown that the issue of its correct interpretation was unlikely to arise in many cases. The jury should normally be given to understand that the expression was an ordinary English word, that it imported a question of degree and that whether in the case before it the impairment could properly be described as substantial was for it to resolve. If, however, the jury had been introduced to the question of whether any impairment beyond the merely trivial would suffice, or if it had been introduced to the concept of a spectrum between the greater than trivial and total impairment, the judge should explain that while the impairment had indeed to pass the merely trivial before it needed be considered, it was not the law that any impairment beyond the trivial would suffice. The judge should likewise make that clear if a risk arose that the jury might misunderstand the import of the word "substantially".

Diminished responsibility involved an impairment of one or more of the abilities listed in the statute to an extent which the jury judged to be substantial, and which it was satisfied significantly contributed to the commission of the offence. Illustrative expressions of the sense of the word could be employed as long as the jury was given clearly to understand that no single synonym should be substituted for the statutory word. In the instant case, the trial judge had not erred when directing the jury (see paras [27-28, 30, 36, 39, 43, 55](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).
