# R v Church [1966] 1 QB 59

It is not the law that whenever any unlawful act is committed in relation to a human being which resulted in death there must be, at least, a conviction for manslaughter. There must be a degree of mens rea. Leaving aside cases of criminal negligence, provocation and diminished responsibility, an unlawful act causing the death of another cannot, simply because it is an unlawful act, render a manslaughter verdict inevitable. For such a verdict inevitably to follow, the unlawful act must be such as all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise would subject the other person to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting, albeit not serious harm. A was convicted of manslaughter of V. He had had a fight with her, thought he had killed her, and threw her in the river. The jury had been directed that on the question of manslaughter it was irrelevant that A thought V was dead when he threw her in the river.

Held, on appeal, that it was relevant and the jury had been misdirected, but the course of A's conduct could rightly, in relation to manslaughter as to murder, be viewed as a series of acts culminating in V's death, and, on that basis, it did not matter in the present case whether A believed her to be alive or dead at the time of the immersion, and accordingly this was a proper case in which to apply the proviso to s.4(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, and the appeal would be dismissed.
