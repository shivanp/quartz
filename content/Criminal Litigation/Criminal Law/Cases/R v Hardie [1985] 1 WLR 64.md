# R v Hardie [1985] 1 WLR 64

FACTS: In this case D took Valium, belonging to his girlfriend. Later he started a fire and said, when charged with criminal damage, that he had no mens rea because of the Valium. He was convicted as the judge directed the jury that drugs were to be treated as drink and the Majewski rules applied.

HELD: The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal on the basis that the Valium was taken for calming his nerves, and there was no evidence that the appellant knew it would make him aggressive, incapable of appreciating risks to others or susceptible to other side effects, so as to make his taking it reckless.
