# R v Ball [1989] Crim LR 730

The defendant kept a mixture of live and blank cartridges for his gun in his overall pockets. He picked up his gun and a handful of cartridges and went out of his house to confront the victim. He fired at the victim and killed him. Ball claimed that he had mistakenly thought he had put a blank cartridge in the gun. The court held that the reasonable person would have been aware of the difference in weight and would not have made that mistake. Therefore the act was dangerous.

In **_R v Ball_** the reasonable person was given knowledge they would have gained from being in the defendant's shoes a while before the unlawful act. The reasonable person will therefore have any special knowledge which the defendant has. This has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in **_R v Farnon_** [2015] EWCA Crim 351 at pp12 and 22.

B shot G and killed her. His defence was that he thought he had loaded the gun with blank cartridges. He kept live and blank cartridges in his pocket and had grabbed a handful when picking up the gun. He had not noticed a difference in weight between the blank cartridges he had earlier fired and the live cartridge which caused G's death. The judge withdrew from the jury consideration of B's knowledge or belief that the cartridge was a blank one. B appealed, arguing that the objective assessment of whether the act was dangerous must be based on the act which the accused believed himself to be committing.

Held, dismissing the appeal against conviction of manslaughter, that in cases of manslaughter arising from an unlawful and dangerous act, the accused's state of mind was relevant to establish that the act was committed intentionally and that it was unlawful. In this case, those facts were admitted. The question whether the act was dangerous was not to be judged by the defendant's appreciation but by that of the sober and reasonable man, into whose appreciation could not be imputed the mistaken belief that his act was not dangerous because he thought he had loaded a blank cartridge, _[R. v Dawson (Brian) (1985) 81 Cr.
