# R v Ryan [1996] Crim LR 320

R appealed against conviction and a sentence of detention of 18 months on two counts of burglary concurrent to a sentence of nine months for his conviction on a guilty plea for handling stolen goods. He was found by an elderly resident with his head and one arm stuck through the window of a house and had to be removed by the fire brigade. R contended that his action was not capable of amounting to entry in law under the [Theft Act 1968 s.9(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF694F90E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=30c7d76a91b342eab7c89a56fb2c2e8d&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, dismissing both appeals, that R's partial presence within the building was capable of constituting entry whether he was capable of stealing property or not and it was therefore correctly left to the jury to decide. R had a bad record for dishonesty and the offence had been committed while on probation for similar offences. The fact that nothing was taken in the burglary was only because he got stuck and the sentence was appropriate for the domestic burglary at night of an elderly occupant, _[R. v Brown (Vincent) [1985] Crim.
