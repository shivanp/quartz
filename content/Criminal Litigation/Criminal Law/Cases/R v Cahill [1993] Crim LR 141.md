# R v Cahill [1993] Crim LR 141

FACTS: In this case, the defendant and his co-accused, Jenner, were returning home after a night out. Both defendants were intoxicated. Two plain-clothed officers watched the defendants as they headed down the street. Cahill stumbled over a pile of newspapers meant for the nearby newsagents. It was alleged by the prosecution that Jenner took one of the papers and that Cahill picked up the package of newspapers and walked off with them. Both men were immediately arrested and subsequently convicted of theft. Cahill argued that he thought that he had picked up a bag of rubbish, and he was under the impression that it would be left on a friend's doorstep as a practical joke.

HELD: His conviction for theft was quashed, on the basis that the original trial judge misdirected the jury on the meaning of the **Theft Act 1968, s 6(1)**, by failing to mention the words 'to dispose of'. The Court of Appeal determined that the phrase 'to dispose of' limited the operation of the **Theft Act 1968, s 6(1)**. It quoted Sir John Smith and like him gave the Shorter Oxford Dictionary definition of ‘to dispose of’:

> “To deal with definitely: to get rid of; to get done with, finish. To make over by way of sale or bargain, sell.”

C was convicted of theft. In summing up, the recorder gave a direction on the elements of theft including the following reference to the [Theft Act 1968 s.6(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF67A1E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a4a96dc47a4347fbb16e7ebb4cf2eda1&contextData=(sc.Default)): "so the law says that, if you have an intention to treat property as your own regardless of the rights of the true owner, then that is an intention permanently to deprive".

Held, allowing C's appeal, that (1) the recorder had erred in directing the jury that an intention to treat property as one's own regardless of the rights of the true owner amounted to an intention permanently to deprive. Under s.6(1) of the 1968 Act the words "to dispose of" should have been included by the recorder before the word "regardless"; (2) the recorder had also erred in appearing to equal the evidential position of C (who gave evidence) with that of his coaccused (who did not). He should have reminded the jury of C's evidence on the issue of his state of mind at the relevant time.
