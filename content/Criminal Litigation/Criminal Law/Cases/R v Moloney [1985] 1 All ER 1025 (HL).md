# R v Moloney [1985] 1 All ER 1025 (HL)

## Abstract

Where murder is alleged the probability of the consequences of his act having been foreseen by the accused must be little short of overwhelming before the requisite intent can be established. M killed his stepfather with a shotgun in circumstances which he alleged were "just a lark." He and the victim had been drinking heavily. His case was that he had no idea firing the gun would injure his stepfather. He was convicted of murder.

Held, allowing the appeal and substituting a conviction for manslaughter, that the law on the requisite intent was unclear. Where specific intent is necessary the probability of the accused having foreseen the consequences must be little short of overwhelming if the intent is to be established. Judges should generally refrain from giving elaborate directions to the jury on the meaning of intent. If, exceptionally, a case calls for directions as to foresight of consequences the judge need do no more than pose two questions:

(1) was death or really serious injury a natural consequence of the acts of the accused?

(2) did he foresee that consequence as being a natural consequence of his act? If both questions are answered in the affirmative then the jury may properly infer that the accused intended that consequence.
