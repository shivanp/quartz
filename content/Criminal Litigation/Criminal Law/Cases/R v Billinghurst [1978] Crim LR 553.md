# R v Billinghurst [1978] Crim LR 553

FACTS: B punched G and fractured his jaw in two places during a rugby match in an off-the-ball incident. He was charged under the OAPA 1861, s 20.

HELD: The judge directed that the players are deemed to consent to force of 'a kind which could reasonably be expected to happen during a game'. The victim said he had been punched on previous occasions and had punched others. Mervyn Davies, a former Welsh International said that in the modern game punching is the rule not the exception! However, the judge considered "on the ball" and "off the ball" play and as B's conduct was found to be "off the ball" it was outside the scope of the implied consent. B was therefore convicted.
