# Kingston [1995] 2 AC 355

## Abstract

In criminal proceedings, if it is proved that the necessary intent was present when the necessary act was done by him, a defendant does not have open to him a defence of involuntary intoxication. There is no such defence at common law and the interests of justice do not demand its adoption. K, a homosexual with paedophiliac predelictions, was charged with indecent assault on a 15-year-old boy. K raised the defence of involuntary intoxication as he had been drugged by his co-defendant, P, who intended to blackmail him. He claimed that he had suffered effects as a result of the intoxication that, while not making him insensible, annulled the criminal liability that his acts would otherwise have involved. The judge directed the jury that an intent induced by a secretly administered drug was nevertheless an intent. K was convicted by a majority verdict. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction ([1994] Q.B. 81), finding that where an intent which would not otherwise have been formed was induced by drink or drugs surreptitiously administered the operative fault is not the defendant's, and the mens rea is negatived. The Crown appealed to the House of Lords.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the ruling and direction of the trial judge were correct. If it was proved that the necessary intent was present when the necessary act was done by him, a defendant did not have open to him a defence of involuntary intoxication;

(2) there was no principle that an accused exceptionally may be acquitted where although an act was intentional the intent arose out of circumstances for which the accused was not to blame, nor that if blame or moral fault was absent the necessary mens rea must also be absent ( _[Chiu-Cheung v Queen, The [1995] 1 A.C. 111, [1994] 6 WLUK 164](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I86E0AE20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=022122cd7fb7464f99bd545f79d2a038&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered);

(3) the loss of selfcontrol through the intervention of a third party did not in general constitute a defence although there may be substantial mitigation;

(4) it was perilous to base any decision on involuntary intoxication on old dicta on the topic (Pearson's Case, 2 Lew 144 doubted in part);

(5) the doctrines of "transferred intent" and estoppel found in the law on voluntary intoxication did not apply to involuntary intoxication, but this did nothing to add involuntary intoxication as a defence where intent was proved ( _[DPP v Majewski [1977] A.C. 443, [1976] 4 WLUK 71](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AF95560E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=022122cd7fb7464f99bd545f79d2a038&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered); and

(6) the defence of involuntary intoxication was not already established as a defence at common law in other jurisdictions, but the Court of Appeal treated it as a matter of existing law and it did not therefore consider the implications of recognising a new defence which ran into difficulties at every turn. The interests of justice did not demand the adoption of a new defence
