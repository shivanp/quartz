# R v Hui Chi-Ming [1991] 3 All ER 897

H appealed against his conviction for murder in Hong Kong. H had been one of a group of friends who had accompanied a man who had set out to injure his girlfriend's brother. An innocent man died of injuries inflicted during that attack. H was charged with murder although two years earlier the boyfriend had been convicted of manslaughter. H appealed on the grounds that: (1) Evidence of the boyfriend's acquittal of murder should have been adduced at his trial; (2) The trial judge should have directed the jury that H, as an accomplice, could not be found guilty of murder unless the principal had been convicted of that offence; and (3) That he had been charged with murder to pressurise him to plead guilty to manslaughter and that was an abuse of process.

Held: Appeal dismissed. The evidence of the principal's acquittal of murder and conviction of manslaughter was correctly excluded from H's trial. There were no exceptional features which rendered that evidence admissible, R. v Cooke (1986) 84 Cr. App. R.286. Their Lordships concluded that it was not necessary for both the principal and the secondary party to have contemplated the material act for the secondary party to be proved guilty. The guilt of the secondary party did not require consideration of the principal's state of mind. Thus, the accomplice must have foreseen the offence which took place as one which the principal could commit as a potential consequence of the unlawful joint venture and also have taken part in that venture. There was strong evidence for a charge of murder and as there was no unfairness, deceit or procedural irregularity there was no abuse of process. (dictum in R. v. Hyde; R. v. Sussex; R. v. Collins [1990] C.L.Y. 119 approved; Chan Wing-Siu v. The Queen [1984] C.L.Y. 667 explained).
