# R v Hinks [2000] 4 All ER 833

The defendant became friendly with a 53-year-old man of limited intelligence. Every day she took him to his building society and he withdrew the maximum daily amount of £300. She influenced, persuaded, or coerced him into giving her this money. Ultimately, he gave her £60,000. She was charged with theft. The trial judge directed the jury to consider the donor's state of mind when he gave the defendant the money and whether the defendant was dishonest. The defendant was convicted. She appealed against her conviction on the grounds that the trial judge had failed to clearly direct the jury that she could not be guilty of theft if the donor had made a valid gift to her.

HELD: The House of Lords dismissed the appeal and held:

(a) appropriation is a neutral act and the state of mind of the donor is irrelevant to appropriation;

(b) therefore appropriation could take place with or without the consent of the owner; and

(c) therefore a person could be guilty of stealing a valid _inter vivos_ gift.

## Summary

H appealed against conviction for theft after she had persuaded F, a man of limited intelligence for whom she cared, to make a series of transfers from his bank account to her own, which she contended he had done by way of gift. H submitted that the presence of consent on F's part meant that she had not appropriated the money. Upholding the conviction, the court held that a gift could be appropriation and that H had dishonestly acquired the money.

## Abstract

H appealed against her conviction for theft. H persuaded F, a man of limited intelligence for whom she cared, to make a series of transfers from his bank account to her own. She maintained that the transfers had constituted a gift. Her conviction having been upheld by the Court of Appeal ([2000] 1 Cr. App. R. 1), the question before the House of Lords was: "whether the acquisition of an indefeasible title to property [was] capable of amounting to an appropriation of property belonging to another for the purposes of the [Theft Act 1968 s.1(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF64BBB0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7ccfb41071c04b64b4c67a20840f7cca&contextData=(sc.Default)) ." It was contended that following the decisions in _[Lawrence v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1972] A.C. 626, [1971] 6 WLUK 101](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID7C32980E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7ccfb41071c04b64b4c67a20840f7cca&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[DPP v Gomez (Edwin) [1993] A.C. 442, [1992] 12 WLUK 45](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9AE75400E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7ccfb41071c04b64b4c67a20840f7cca&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , appropriation could only take place where the owner preserved some proprietary interest or the right to take up again or restore a proprietary interest in the relevant property.

Held, dismissing the appeal (Lord Hutton and Lord Hobhouse dissenting), that an indefeasible title to property acquired by means of taking a gift from a person who was easily influenced could constitute "appropriation" under the Act. "Appropriation" for the purposes of s.3(1) should not be interpreted too strictly and was an objective term relating to any adoption of an owner's rights. It was not dependent on the consent of the owner, Lawrence applied. Furthermore, the gift of property whereby the owner relinquished his entire proprietary interest in the property transferred could constitute theft where the recipient had acted dishonestly, Gomez applied. There was no requirement for appropriation to be unlawful for it to constitute theft as the requirement for the prosecution to show dishonesty and the intention to permanently deprive provided adequate protection against injustice, and any narrowing of the definition of appropriation could lead to the acquittal of dishonest persons whose conduct merited conviction.
