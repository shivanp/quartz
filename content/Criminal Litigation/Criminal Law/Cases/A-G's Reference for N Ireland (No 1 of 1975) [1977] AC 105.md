# A-G's Reference for N Ireland (No 1 of 1975) [1977] AC 105

The answer to a particular point of law referred under the [Criminal Appeal (Northern Ireland) Act 1968, s. 48A](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE5C381E07F2C11E29F32C7FD44C0EEEC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9877ed90d463482383db37beaa9002f6&contextData=(sc.Default)) and depending on a particular set of facts cannot afford general guidance in other cases. Per curiam: the question of what force is reasonable for the prevention of crime is always a question for the jury. In Northern Ireland there is an armed insurrection and the position of a soldier is not to be compared with that of a civilian. The accused was a member of an Army foot patrol in an area where terrorists were believed to be active. The deceased, who was unarmed, ran off when ordered to halt by the accused. The accused shot him dead. The accused was tried on a charge of murder by a judge sitting alone and was acquitted. The Attorney General referred, inter alia, the following point of law under s. 48A of the 1968 Act: "whether a soldier commits a crime when, in the circumstances set out, he fires to kill or seriously wound an unarmed person because he honestly and reasonably believes that the person is a member of a proscribed organisation who is seeking to run away, and the soldier's shot kills that person."

Held, that the issue to be determined was whether the accused had used reasonable force. That was a question of fact for the tribunal; the facts in this case were sufficient to raise the issue of whether the Crown had proved that the shooting constituted reasonable force.
