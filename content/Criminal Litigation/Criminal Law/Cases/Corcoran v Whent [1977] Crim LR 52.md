# Corcoran v Whent [1977] Crim LR 52

After eating a meal and leaving the restaurant D's friend pointed out that the meal had not been paid for. Justices found that D formed the intention of permanently depriving the restaurant of food after leaving.

Held, allowing D's appeal from a conviction of theft, that it was ridiculous to suggest that any conscious intention to deal with food could be formed after its consumption.
