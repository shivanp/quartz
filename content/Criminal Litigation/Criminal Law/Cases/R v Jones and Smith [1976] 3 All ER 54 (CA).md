# R v Jones and Smith [1976] 3 All ER 54 (CA)

FACTS: J and S entered the home of S's father and took two television sets. They were convicted of burglary and appealed against conviction. One of the grounds of appeal was that a person with general permission to enter the premises of another could not be a trespasser. At the trial, S's father said that his son could never be a trespasser in his house at any time.

HELD: The appeals were dismissed on the basis that their entry was in excess of permission given to them. The court was satisfied they entered against the consent or in excess of consent given by Mr Smith to his son.

> 'â€¦ it is our view that a person is a trespasser for the purpose of s 9(1)(b) of the Theft Act 1968 if he enters premises of another knowing that he is entering in excess of the permission that has been given to him, or being reckless as to whether he is entering in excess of the permission that has been given to him to enter. Provided that the facts are known to the accused which enable him to realise that he is acting in excess of the permission given or that he is acting recklessly as to whether he exceeds that permission, then that is sufficient for the jury to decide that he is in fact a trespasser.' (_Per_ James LJ.)
