# Williams v Phillips (1957) 41 Cr App R 5

Refuse which a householder puts out to be taken away is not abandoned property. Dustmen employed by a corporation were convicted of stealing goods from dustbins collected in the course of their duties, and selling the goods to dealers and sharing the proceeds.

Held, on appeal, refuse put in a dustbin was not abandoned; it was the householders' property until it was taken away, when it became the corporation's property; the men knew that they were not allowed to take anything from the refuse and there was abundant evidence on which the justices could convict; therefore, the appeals must be dismissed.
