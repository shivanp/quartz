# R v Constanza [1997] 2 Cr App R 492

C appealed against his conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contending that his conduct, which had involved stalking the victim over a prolonged period, did not amount to assault as the victim could not have feared immediate and unlawful personal violence because no physical harm had occurred.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that if the prosecution could prove that the victim had a fear of violence at some time, not excluding the immediate future, this was enough to make out the offence of assault which could be committed solely by words.
