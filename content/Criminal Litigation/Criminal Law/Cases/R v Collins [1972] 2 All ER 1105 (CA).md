# R v Collins [1972] 2 All ER 1105 (CA)

A person enters premises as a trespasser within the meaning of the [Theft Act 1968 s.9(1)(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF694F90E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2fa06d61b1de4591a687d91e67711e1b&contextData=(sc.Default)) , if he enters knowing that he is a trespasser or else reckless as to whether he is a trespasser or not.

L, the complainant, a young lady aged 18, was sleeping in her bed near her bedroom window, when at about 4.00 a.m. she awoke and saw on her window sill a blond haired young man, who was naked, except for his socks, and whose penis was erect. Leaping to the conclusion that the man was her boy-friend, she invited him in, and sexual intercourse took place. However, there were certain things about the man which led her to believe that all was not as it should be. She switched on the light and saw that it was not her boy-friend, but the defendant, C. C was convicted of burglary with intent to commit rape, contrary to s.9(1)(a) of the Theft Act 1968.

On appeal against conviction, held, that the jury had to be satisfied that the defendant had made a substantial entry into the bedroom without L causing him to believe that she was consenting to his entry. The jury had not been invited to consider whether C knew he was entering without an invitation, or was reckless whether he did so or not, and the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.
