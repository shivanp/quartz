# R v Hale (1979) 68 Cr App R 415

FACTS: The defendant and his co-accused went to the house of the victim. They wore stockings over their heads. The defendant put his hand over the victim’s mouth to stop her screaming. He then went upstairs and took a jewellery box. Both men then tied up the victim, gagged her and told her not to phone the police for at least five minutes after they had left, otherwise they would do something to her little boy.

The defendants were convicted and they appealed, submitting that the judge had misdirected the jury, by indicating that if an accused used force in order to make good his escape with the stolen goods that would suffice for robbery. The appellants contended that the theft was complete when the jewellery box was first seized and any force used after that point was not 'immediately before or at the time of stealing' nor was it used 'in order to steal'.

HELD: The court dismissed the appeal and held that the appropriation should be regarded as a continuing act. It was for the jury to decide when the act of appropriation had come to an end. Thus, the jury were entitled to rely upon the act of tying up the victim after seizing the jewellery box, provided they were satisfied that the force was used in order to steal.

Note that the jury were entitled to convict of robbery relying on the force used when the defendant put his hand over the victim’s mouth:

> 'To say that the conduct is over and done with as soon as he lays hands upon the property, or when he first manifests an intention to deal with it as his, is contrary to common sense and to the natural meaning of the words. A thief who steals a motor car first opens the door. Is it to be said that the act of starting up the motor is no more a part of the theft? … the act of appropriation does not suddenly cease. It is a continuous act, and it is a matter for the jury to decide whether or not the act of appropriation has finished.' (_Per_ Eveleigh LJ.)

An appropriation is a continuing act, and if force is used whilst the appropriation continues, and the other ingredients of theft are present, the offence is one of robbery. A was charged with robbery. A and B had forced their way into Mrs. X's house; A had put his hand over her mouth while B took her jewellery. Before leaving they tied her up. A was convicted. On appeal, held, dismissing the appeal, that appropriation was a continuing act, and the jury were entitled to convict on the basis of A's putting his hand over Mrs. X's mouth, and also in tying her upon if they were satisfied that the force was used to enable A to steal.
