# R v Russell [1933] VLR 59

A husband who stood by and watched his wife drown their children was guilty of aiding and abetting the homicide. His deliberate abstention from action gave encouragement and authority to his wife’s act.

---

The prisoner was charged with the murder of his wife and their two young children, who met their deaths by drowning. The jury asked to be directed as to the responsibility of the prisoner on the assumption that his wife took the children into the water without his assistance, while he stood by ‘conniving to’ the act. The jury found the prisoner guilty of the manslaughter of his wife and the children. The Victoria Supreme Court held that the verdicts of manslaughter of the wife and of the children should stand. The legal result of that finding was, in the circumstances, that the accused was guilty as a participator or principal in the second degree.
