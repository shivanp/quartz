# R v Richardson and Irwin [1999] 1 Cr App R 392

The defendants seized their friend whom they claimed they believed was consenting and held him over a balcony. They dropped him and he broke several bones. Their conviction was quashed as the trial judge had not directed the jury to consider consent.

The complainant, the appellants and others, all university students, had been drinking and were indulging in horseplay during the course of which the complainant was lifted over the edge of a balcony, allegedly by the appellants, and dropped. He fell about 10 or 12 feet and was injured. The prosecution case was that the appellants had together acted both unlawfully and maliciously, in the sense that they each foresaw dropping the complainant would or might cause harm and that they nevertheless took the risk of doing so. The appellants' case was that the complainant had consented to the horseplay and that his fall was an accident. The recorder directed the jury that they had to consider each appellant's intention on the basis of a reasonable (i.e.. not under the influence of drink) man and not (as they were) under the influence of drink. The appellants were convicted of inflicting grievous bodily harm, contrary to the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0BF9A7E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bffbf0a1921a4e958c9a1d95a50fe9eb&contextData=(sc.Default)). They appealed against conviction on the grounds that the recorder misdirected the jury.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the jury should have been directed to decide not whether the reasonable sober man would have realised that injury might result, but whether these particular appellants would have foreseen, had they not been drinking, that their actions might cause injury, and that, accordingly, the convictions were unsafe and would be quashed, _[R. v Aitken (Thomas Adam) [1992] 1 W.L.R. 1006, [1992] 5 WLUK 264](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2EED9D80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bffbf0a1921a4e958c9a1d95a50fe9eb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
