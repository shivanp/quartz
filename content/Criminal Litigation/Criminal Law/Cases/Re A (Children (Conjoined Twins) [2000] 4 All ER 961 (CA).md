# Re A (Children (Conjoined Twins) [2000] 4 All ER 961 (CA)

Both children were certain to die in the absence of a surgical procedure to separate them. The operation would save one twin, but the parents would not give their consent. The judge observed that the parents had a legal duty to the twin, who could be saved. By denying that twin the chance to live, they might be guilty of killing her under the principle in [[R v Gibbons and Proctor (1918) 13 Cr App R 134]].
