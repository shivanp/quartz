# R v Taylor [1996] 10 Archbold News 2 (CA)

FACTS: The defendant handed a bank cashier a note which demanded that the cashier hand over money, otherwise D would hurt the customer standing behind him. No force was used against the customer standing behind him, nor was the customer put in fear that he would be subjected then and there to force. In this case, neither could it be argued that the defendant sought to put the customer in fear that he would be subjected then and there to force because his threat against the customer was directed to the bank cashier.

HELD: There was no robbery, however, the defendant had committed an offence of blackmail.
