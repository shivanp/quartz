# Additional principles

This element considers some additional principles of criminal liability such as the rules on coincidence, transferred malice and mistake.

The criminal liability equation can be stated as: criminal liability equals _actus reus_ and _mens_ _rea_ and the absence of a valid defence. We will consider three additional principles of criminal liability in this element:

- Coincidence of AR and MR;
- Transferred malice; and
- Mistake.

## Coincidence of Actus Reus and Mens Rea

As a general rule, the defendant must have the relevant mens rea for the offence at the precise moment when D commits the actus reus. This is known as the requirement for coincidence of actus reus and mens rea.

The courts have developed some flexible interpretations to get round the requirement for coincidence of _actus reus_ and _mens rea_:

- the continuing act theory; and
- the one transaction principle.

## Continuing Act Theory

A defendant can be guilty of an offence using the continuing act theory if they form the mens rea for the offence at some point during the actus reus continuing.

In [[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 1 QB 439]] case, the defendant formed the mens rea when he realised that his vehicle was on the police officer’s foot and did not move it. At the moment he formed the mens rea, the actus reus was still continuing.

## One Transaction Principle

Sometimes the court will categorise the actions of the accused as a series of acts, making up one transaction. In certain circumstances it is enough for the defendant to have the mens rea at some time during that transaction.

[[Thabo Meli [1954] 1 All ER 373 PC]]

This principle has been extended to cases where there was no prior planning.

## Causation

In [[R v Le Brun [1992] QB 61]] it was recognised that sometimes the problem of coincidence of _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ may be avoided by viewing the act done with the _mens rea_ (the first act) as causing subsequent acts. D's act of knocking his wife unconscious caused him to drag her home and drop her on the pavement.

Where it isn’t clear which of D’s acts was the _actus reus_, the defendant must have the mens rea for the relevant crime when D does each of the acts which could constitute the actus reus.

[[AG's Ref (No 4 of 1980) [1981] 1 WLR 705]]

## Transferred Malice

Transferred “malice” is when D’s _mens rea_ is transferred from the intended harm to the actual harm.

It does not make a difference to criminal liability that D, for example, intends to kill X, but misses and kills Y instead. The doctrine of transferred malice operates to allow the mens rea against X to be transferred and joined with the actus reus that causes the prohibited harm to Y. D's intended harm against X can be transferred to the unintended victim, Y, and D will still be guilty of the crime of murder.

- [[R v Latimer (1886) LR 17 QBD 359]]
- [[R v Mitchell [1983] QB 741]]

## Limits of Transferred Malice

[[R v Pembliton (1874) LR 2 CCR 119]]

## Mistake

Where the defendant makes a mistake, the effect this will have on criminal liability depends upon the type of mistake. We will consider:

- Ignorance of the law; and
	- If the defendant does not know they are breaking the law, this mistake will not help avoid liability. Hence, the saying ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse'.
	- This is the case even if the defendant’s ignorance is quite reasonable, and even if it were impossible for D to know of the prohibition in question.
	- [[R v Bailey (1800) Russ & Ry 1]]
- Mistakes that negate the mens rea.
	- A defendant might make a mistake as to some element of the actus reus, which will prevent D from having the mens rea.
	- This could be a mistake of fact, for example if the defendant takes the wrong umbrella away from a restaurant, mistakenly believing it is their umbrella, there will be no liability for theft because D will not be dishonest.
	- The mistake could be one of civil law, as seen in [[R v Smith [1974] QB 354]].

## Summary

This element considered the following additional principles of criminal liability.

- **Coincidence of _actus reus_ and _mens rea_**_-_ is required for criminal liability. The relevant guilty act and guilty mind for the offence must occur at the same time. The courts have interpreted this concept widely using:

**The continuing act theory-** as long as the _mens rea_ takes place at some point during the _actus reus_ continuing to take place this will be enough, **_Fagan v MPC_**;

**The one transaction principle-** it will be sufficient that the defendant has the _mens rea_ for the offence at some point during a series of acts, **_Thabo Meli_**.

- **Transferred malice-** the _mens rea_ for the intended harm can be transferred to the actual harm that occurs (**_Latimer_**_),_ as long as the _mens rea_ for the offences is the same (**_Pembliton_**_)_.
- **Mistake-** while ignorance of the law will not prevent criminal liability (**_Bailey_**), the defendant may make a mistake which can mean that the _mens rea_ of the offence is not fulfilled and will escape criminal liability as a result (**_R v Smith_**).
