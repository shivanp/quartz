# Fraud

## Fraud Act 2006

The [Fraud Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/contents) (FA 2006) abolished the old offences related to deception. They were replaced primarily by one offence of fraud under the FA 2006, section 1.

```ad-statute
title: [s 1 FA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/section/1)

(1) A person is guilty of fraud if he is in breach of any of the sections listed in subsection (2) (which provide for different ways of committing the offence).

(2) The sections are—

- (a) section 2 (fraud by false representation),
- (b) section 3 (fraud by failing to disclose information), and
- (c) section 4 (fraud by abuse of position).

(3) A person who is guilty of fraud is liable—
- (a) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum (or to both);
- (b) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to a fine (or to both).

(4) Subsection (3)(a) applies in relation to Northern Ireland as if the reference to 12 months were a reference to 6 months. 
```

## Fraud by False Representation

This offence most closely matches the old offences of deception, and therefore reference will be made to case law that assists in explaining the concepts involved. It is, however, much wider than the deception offences, being a **conduct** rather than a **result** crime.

All that is required for the _actus reus_ is a false representation. There is no requirement that this representation deceives anyone.

```ad-statute
title: s 2 FA 2006

(1) A person is in breach of this section if he—
- (a) dishonestly makes a false representation, and
- (b) intends, by making the representation—
	- (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
	- (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.

(2 )A representation is false if—
- (a) it is untrue or misleading, and
- (b) the person making it knows that it is, or might be, untrue or misleading.

(3) “Representation” means any representation as to fact or law, including a representation as to the state of mind of—
- (a) the person making the representation, or
- (b) any other person.

(4) A representation may be express or implied.

(5) For the purposes of this section a representation may be regarded as made if it (or anything implying it) is submitted in any form to any system or device designed to receive, convey or respond to communications (with or without human intervention). 
```

### Express or Implied Representation

The representation that forms the heart of the case can be made expressly by the defendant, or can be implied, s 2(4). An implied representation can arise from:

- what the defendant says – in [[R v King [1979] Crim LR 122]]; or
- the defendant’s conduct – in [[DPP v Ray [1974] AC 370]] the court held that the respondent made a continuing implied representation when entering a restaurant, ordering and eating a meal that he had the means and the intention of paying for it before he left.

Pure silence, without an accompanying action cannot amount to a representation ([[R v Twaite [2010] EWCA Crim 12973]]).

An example of false representation by conduct: [[Idrees v DPP [2011] EWHC 624]]

### Representation as to Fact, Law or State of Mind

A representation as to fact or law will normally be relatively straightforward. A representation as to the state of mind, whether of the defendant or any other person, requires further consideration.

A false representation as to one's belief may satisfy the requirements of the FA 2006, s 2 if it can be shown that the defendant does not in fact hold that opinion or belief.

In [[Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459]], the court stated:

> 'It is very difficult to prove what the state of a man's mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else. A misrepresentation as to the state of a man's mind is therefore, a misstatement of fact …'

In [[Smith v Land and House Property Corporation (1885) LR 28 Ch D 7 (CA)]], Bowen LJ stated:

> 'If the facts are not equally well known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.’

If the defendant is in a better position to express the belief or opinion than the other party, this may also amount to a false representation.

The state of mind required can also relate to an intention. If the defendant states an intention to do something, when D in fact has no such intention, this may also amount to a false representation ([[DPP v Ray [1974] AC 370]]).

### Representation Must Be Untrue or Misleading

The issue of whether a representation is untrue will be an issue of fact for the jury to determine, and will often be a straightforward one to resolve.

The Act appears to create an alternative approach by describing a false representation as one that is untrue or misleading. It is, however, unclear at present what the term 'misleading' adds.

#### Overcharging

One situation that the courts had to resolve under the old deception offences, was whether a trader or service provider, who charges a customer a sum for goods or services significantly above the market rate, was guilty of deception.

It has been argued that the basic principle in English law is that a person is entitled to charge whatever sum they consider appropriate – it is up to the customer to assess whether the amount charged represents a fair price. Nevertheless, criminal law has been willing to impose liability in certain circumstances for such overcharging.

Key cases:

- In [[R v Silverman (1988) 86 Cr App R 213]] false representation arose because of circumstances of mutual trust
- In [[R v Jones (Ivor) (1993) The Times, 15 February]] Auld LJ referred to the defendant being the victim's 'trusted friend'.

#### Deceiving a Machine

This is covered by FA 2006, s 2(5) which states:

> 'For the purposes of this section a representation may be regarded as made if it (or anything implying it) is submitted in any form to any system or device designed to receive, convey or respond to communications (with or without human intervention).'

This provision will catch those using stolen credit cards and PIN codes to get money from ATMs, and also those who use such cards to make online purchases. In such cases a defendant could be charged with the theft of the card, and also for using the card to falsely represent to a machine that they are entitled to withdraw the funds, or are entitled to make a payment for the sum, which D attempts to spend.

### Mens Rea

#### Dishonesty

The test for dishonesty has always been the same as that applied in [[Theft]]. This means that [[Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67]] is the test which should be applied.

Note, however, that the negative definitions of dishonesty contained in the [Theft Act 1968, s 2(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/2) apply only to the offence of theft and therefore will not apply to offences under the Fraud Act 2006. This means that the first part of the test in Ivey, which directs the jury to the defendant’s knowledge and belief, may well prove to be significant.

[[R v Clarke [1996] Crim LR 824]] is a case decided under the old law, although the principle which flows from it is thought to be equally valid under the Fraud Act 2006: just because D has lied, that does not make them dishonest.

#### False Statement

The defendant must know, or be aware, that the statement is untrue or misleading: FA 2006, s 2(2)(b).

It appears that the requirement that the defendant is aware that the statement is untrue or misleading will be satisfied if D is subjectively aware of the possibility that what they are saying or implying is false.

In [[R v Staines (1974) 60 Cr App R 160]] the Court of Appeal held that recklessness with regard to a false statement requires more than mere carelessness or negligence; there must be an indifference to, or disregard of, whether a statement is true or false. A belief, however unreasonable, that the representation is true will prevent the defendant's conduct from amounting to deception. Thus, if a person knows the statement they are making might be false, then they should make that clear to the person they are making it to. If a person gives a clear caveat, then they do not make a false statement, but a true statement.

#### Intention to Make a Gain or Cause a Loss

This requirement of mens rea (which is common to all the ways that the offence of fraud can be committed) marks one of the most important differences between the old deception offences and those created by the Fraud Act 2006. The deception offences, such as obtaining property by deception, required that the defendant actually obtain something as a result of D’s representation (property in the case of this specific offence).

'Gain' and 'loss' are defined in [s 5 FA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/section/5)

```ad-statute
title: s 5 FA 2006

(2) “Gain” and “loss”—

(a) extend only to gain or loss in money or other property;

(b) include any such gain or loss whether temporary or permanent; and “property” means any property whether real or personal (including things in action and other intangible property).

(3) “Gain” includes a gain by keeping what one has, as well as a gain by getting what one does not have.

(4) “Loss” includes a loss by not getting what one might get, as well as a loss by parting with what one has.
```

The requirement of an actual gain or loss is absent from the offences of fraud under the Fraud Act 2006. All that is required is that the defendant intended to make a gain, even if no such gain arose. In fact, this element of mens rea is much wider than that, as it is enough that the defendant:

- intends to make a gain for themselves;
- intends to make a gain for someone else;
- intends to cause a loss to another; or
- exposes someone to a risk of loss.

In [[R v Dziruni [2008] EWCA Crim 677]] a false representation made with a view to getting a job could be regarded as intention to make a gain in terms of money.

## Fraud by Failure to Disclose

This is set out by [s 3 FA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/section/3)

```ad-statute
title: s 3 FA 2006

A person is in breach of this section if he—

(a) dishonestly fails to disclose to another person information which he is under a legal duty to disclose, and

(b) intends, by failing to disclose the information—
- (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
- (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss. 
```

### Actus Reus

The actus reus of fraud by failure to disclose requires:

- existence of a legal duty to disclose; and
- failure to disclose.

#### Existence of a Legal Duty

The Fraud Act 2006 makes no attempt to define the type of duty to which this section applies.

Some guidance can be obtained from the Law Commission's report that led to the Act.

The Commission suggested a number of examples of the type of duty involved, including a duty:

1. arising from statute (such as the provisions governing company prospectuses);
2. within a transaction of the utmost good faith (such as a contract of insurance);
3. contained in the express or implied terms of a contract;
4. arising from a custom in a particular trade or market; and
5. arising from a fiduciary relationship (such as that between a principal and agent).

[[R v Razoq [2012] EWCA Crim 674]] is an example of a duty arising from contract. See also benefits case: [[R v Mashta [2010] EWCA 2595]]

### Failure to Disclose

Once the existence of a legal duty has been established, the prosecution must prove that the defendant failed to disclose the information to another person. This will be a matter of fact, and in most instances will be easy to prove.

### Mens Rea

Two aspects of mens rea are required, which are identical to the mens rea for fraud by false representation:

1. Dishonesty
2. Intention to make a gain or cause a loss.

## Fraud by Abuse of Position

Details of this form of fraud can be found in the [FA 2006, s 4](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/section/4):

```ad-statute
title: s 4 FA 2006

(1) A person is in breach of this section if he—

(a) occupies a position in which he is expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another person,

(b) dishonestly abuses that position, and

(c) intends, by means of the abuse of that position—
- (i) to make a gain for himself or another, or
- (ii) to cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.

(2) A person may be regarded as having abused his position even though his conduct consisted of an omission rather than an act. 
```

### AR: Occupying a Position

The Act does not seek to define the type of position required, except to state that this position must be one requiring the defendant to look after the victim's financial well-being.

The Law Commission's report which led to the Fraud Act 2006 gives some assistance:

> 'The necessary relationship will be present between trustee and beneficiary, director and company, professional person and client, agent and principal, employee and employer, or between partners. It may arise otherwise, for example within a family, or in the context of voluntary work, or in any context where the parties are not at arm's length. In nearly all cases where it arises, it will be recognised by the civil law as importing fiduciary duties, and any relationship that is so recognised will suffice.
>
> We see no reason, however, why the existence of such duties should be essential. This does not of course mean that it would be entirely a matter for the fact-finders whether the necessary relationship exists. The question whether the particular facts alleged can properly be described as giving rise to that relationship will be an issue capable of being ruled upon by the judge and, if the case goes to the jury, of being the subject of directions.'

The conclusion that can be drawn from the explanation from the Law Commission seems to be that the position required by section 4, will be easy to prove where there is a professional, fiduciary or long-term business relationship.

However, the type of fraud outlined in the section 4 is clearly not limited to such relationships.

```ad-example
If a woman starts visiting her elderly neighbor and helping with his shopping one can see that this relationship would fit into the last example given by the Law Commission of 'voluntary work.' This would be particularly true if the neighbour asked the woman to help him in any way with his finances, such as collecting his pension from the Post Office.
```

In [[R v Pennock and Pennock [2014] EWCA Crim 598]], the Court of Appeal confirmed that the existence of a necessary relationship and its abuse will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

See also [[R v Marshall [2009] EWCA Crim 2076]] and [[R v Valujevs and another [2014] EWCA Crim 2888]].

The judge in _Valujevs_ interpreted the verb “expect” in the dictionary sense of “look for as due from another”. Although it undoubtedly encompasses a legal duty, the judge concluded it is clear Parliament did not mean to limit the phrase to a legal duty, fiduciary or otherwise, because that would have been easy to express in the statute. However, the judge concluded that Parliament could not have meant for this provision to cover anything less than “a pressing moral and social obligation to another, recognised by all reasonable people”. That is similar to a breach of a position of trust. The judge determined that [section 4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID4854AA0754511DB8071C6D7F7AFDBBF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=00e905f1f92c4becb97feff961ca03c9&contextData=(sc.DocLink)) should not apply in “the general commercial area where individuals and businesses compete in markets of one kind or another, including labour markets, and are entitled and expected to look after their own interests”.

### AR: Abuse of Position

Once the prosecution have shown that the defendant occupied a position requiring D to safeguard the position of the victim of the fraud, they must then prove that the position has been abused. Once again, there is no guidance from the Fraud Act 2006 as to what would amount to an abuse of position.

However, some direction has been provided from the case of [[R v Pennock and Pennock [2014] EWCA Crim 598]]. The Court of Appeal adopted the definition suggested in Archbold, namely: 'uses incorrectly' or 'puts to improper use' the position held in a manner that is contrary to the expectation that arises because of that position. Note that this ruling is very controversial.

Note that s 4(2) provides that this offence can be committed by an omission as well as by an act. An example of how this might occur is when an employee who has a duty to collect payment on behalf of their employer fails to do so.

```ad-important
The jury will decide on the facts whether the necessary relationship exists for D to have occupied a position in which they are expected to safeguard or not act against the financial interests of another person. However, before the jury decide this, the judge will consider whether the particular facts are capable of giving rise to D occupying a position and may give specific directions to the jury on this point.
```

### Mens Rea

This includes dishonesty, and intention to make a gain or cause a loss.

Dishonesty is the [[Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67]] test once again, and intention to make a gain or cause a loss is again explained in s 5 FA 2006.

```ad-note
Where an employee fails to collect sums owed to their employer, due to laziness (rather than assisting the person who should be paying or punishing their employer), there would be an oblique intention to make a gain for another and cause a loss to their employer. Applying the test in [[R v Woollin [1999] AC 82]], it would be virtually certain that such a gain and loss would be caused and the defendant would appreciate this to be the case.
```
