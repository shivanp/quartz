# Manslaughter

## Introduction

Involuntary manslaughter includes all varieties of unlawful homicide other than murder. It is distinguished from murder by the lack of 'malice aforethought'. In [[Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576]], Lord Atkin at 581, alluded to the difficulties of defining an offence (or offences) which cover a wide range of circumstances:

> 'Of all crimes manslaughter appears to afford most difficulties of definition, for it concerns homicide in so many and so varying conditions … the law … recognises murder on one hand based mainly, though not exclusively, on an intention to kill, and manslaughter on the other hand, based mainly, though not exclusively, on the absence of intent to kill, but with the presence of an element of ‘unlawfulness’ which is the elusive factor.'

There are two main forms of involuntary manslaughter: unlawful act (or constructive) manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter.

## Unlawful Act (constructive) Manslaughter

Here, the accused lacks the mens rea for murder, but kills someone in the course of committing an unlawful (criminal) act.

The modern definition of unlawful act manslaughter arises from [[DPP v Newbury and Jones [1977] AC 500]]. The defendants had pushed a concrete paving slab onto an oncoming train, killing the guard.

The court stated that to be guilty of the offence, the prosecution must prove that:

1. the defendants intentionally (voluntarily) did an act;
2. the act was unlawful;
3. the unlawful act was dangerous; and
4. the unlawful act caused the death of the victim.

### The Defendant's Act Was Intentional

The accused must intentionally, i.e., voluntarily, have carried out an act, which results in the death of a person. This refers to intention with regard to the doing of the act, not to the consequences which flow from it.

### The Defendant's Act Was Unlawful

There are three aspects to the defendant’s act being unlawful. It must be:

- a criminal act;
- an intrinsically unlawful act; and
- an act rather than an omission.

The unlawful act must be a criminal act ([[R v Franklin (1883) 15 Cox CC 163]]). Initially, it was accepted that the unlawful act could be civil or criminal. However, since this decision, it has been settled law that the unlawful act must be criminal.

> 'The mere fact of a civil wrong committed by one person against another ought not to be used as an incident which is a necessary step in a criminal case.’

The criminal act must be independent of the fact that it has caused death ([[R v Lamb [1967] 2 QB 981]]). Both the actus reus and mens rea of the criminal act must be proven ([[R v Scarlett [1993] 4 All ER 629]]).

The unlawful act need not be serious and can simply be a common assault. Typically, the unlawful act will be an offence against the person, but it can also be any offence, e.g., theft or criminal damage.

The act must be intrinsically unlawful ([[Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576]]. The unlawful act cannot be based on a lawful act, which becomes unlawful only because of the negligent or reckless manner in which it is performed e.g., driving.

Lord Atkin in [[Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576]]:

> 'There is an obvious difference in the law of manslaughter between doing an unlawful act and doing a lawful act with a degree of carelessness which the Legislature makes criminal. If it were otherwise a man who killed another while driving without due care and attention would ex necessitate commit manslaughter.’

### There Must Be an Act Rather Than an Omission

A person cannot be guilty of unlawful act manslaughter by an omission. A failure to do something while under a duty to do it would correctly be charged as gross negligence manslaughter.

In [[R v Lowe [1973] QB 702]] the Court of Appeal quashed the defendant's manslaughter conviction, which had resulted from his criminal omission to look after his nine-week-old daughter. Phillimore LJ stated:

> 'If I strike a child in a manner likely to cause harm it is right that if the child dies I may be charged with manslaughter. If, however, I omit to do something with the result that it suffers injury to its health which results in its death, we think that a charge of manslaughter should not be an inevitable consequence, even if the omission is deliberate.’

### The Act Must Be Dangerous

In [[R v Church [1966] 1 QB 59]] Edmund Davies J stated that:

> '… the unlawful act must be such as all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm.'

Whether the act is dangerous is an objective test and depends not on the accused's appreciation of the likely harm, but on what the sober and reasonable person would appreciate. This was affirmed in [[DPP v Newbury and Jones [1977] AC 500]].

### Type of Harm

In [[R v Dawson (1985) 81 Cr App R 150]] the Court of Appeal said that the type of harm likely to result from the unlawful act must be physical and not emotional harm. However, Watkins LJ said:

> '…there seems to us to be no sensible reason why shock produced by fright should not come within the definition of harm in the context … Shock can produce devastating and lasting effects, for instance upon the nervous system. That is surely harm.'

In [[R v JM & SM (2012) EWCA Crim 2293]] the Court of Appeal said that the type of harm a reasonable person would have foreseen does not have to be that actually caused.

### Circumstances to Be Taken into Account

The dangerousness of the act is judged from the viewpoint of a sober and reasonable person. The reasonable person will have knowledge of the circumstances that they would have had if they had been in the accused's shoes at the time of the offence.

The defendant could become liable if they became aware of a fact during the commission of the offence which would make the act dangerous ([[R v Dawson (1985) 81 Cr App R 150]], [[R v Watson [1989] 2 All ER 865]]).

In [[R v Ball [1989] Crim LR 730]] the reasonable person was given knowledge they would have gained from being in the defendant's shoes a while before the unlawful act. The reasonable person will therefore have any special knowledge which the defendant has. This has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in [[R v Farnon [2015] EWCA Crim 351]].

```ad-summary
We could summarise the legal principles from the cases on the act being dangerous as follows:
- The sober and reasonable person knows everything they would have known if they had been in the defendant's shoes at the time of the offence.
- The sober and reasonable person has any special knowledge that the defendant has or ought to have known.
- Being reasonable, they do not make any unreasonable mistakes made by the defendant.
```

### The Unlawful Act Caused the Death of the Victim

Normal rules of causation apply. The act must have both factually and legally caused the death of the victim. The issue of causation is the last stage in the four-part test for unlawful act manslaughter. See [[Criminal Law/Causation]].

#### Causing Death by Supplying Drugs

The courts have faced particular difficulties in applying the rules relating to unlawful act manslaughter to deaths arising from the supply, by the defendant to the victim, of controlled drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, etc. In order to understand the rules relating to this issue, it is helpful to distinguish between two situations, where D:

1. directly administers the drug to V, for example by taking a syringe and injecting V with it; and
2. merely supplies V with the drugs, or assists V, such as by mixing a particular 'cocktail' of drugs, or filling the syringe before passing it on to V, who then takes the drugs themselves.

Previously, the courts, through some ingenious mental gymnastics, successfully managed to bring cases falling under (b) into the ambit of unlawful act manslaughter. The confusion in law that these efforts caused has been resolved to a large extent by the case of [[R v Kennedy [2007] 3 WLR 612]].

#### Administration of the Drug by the Defendant

[[R v Cato [1976] 1 WLR 110]]: The deceased asked Cato to inject him with heroin. Cato obliged, and the victim died as a result. Cato was convicted of manslaughter. He appealed on the basis that there had been no unlawful act, as the victim had consented. The Court of Appeal upheld Cato's conviction for unlawful act manslaughter, holding that, by injecting the deceased with heroin, Cato had acted unlawfully by administering a noxious thing contrary to the [Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 23](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/23), and the deceased's death was caused by this unlawful act. Consent by the victim was no defence to this.

R v Kennedy confirmed the decision of R v Cato on this point.

#### Supply of Drugs and Assisting the Deceased to Take the Drugs

This concerns situations where the deceased voluntarily consumes the drug, in awareness of what they are taking. Where the deceased is deceived, or is otherwise unaware of what they are taking, the supplier of the drug may still be guilty of an offence under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 23. This offence could form the basis of a conviction for unlawful act manslaughter.

Where the deceased is aware of what they are taking, could the supplier of drugs still be convicted? Does it make a difference if the supplier of drugs does more than simply supplying, such as by mixing a particular 'cocktail' of drugs, or filling the syringe before passing it on to V? The issues fell to be determined by the House of Lords in [[R v Kennedy [2007] 3 WLR 612]].

```ad-summary

In **_DPP v Newbury_ _and Jones_** the court stated that to be guilty of the offence the prosecution must prove that:

(1) **The defendant intentionally (voluntarily) did an act**- which results in the death of a person (D does not need intention regarding the consequences which flow from the act)

**(2) The act was unlawful**- It must be:
- A criminal act- rather than a civil one, **_R v Franklin,_** the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ of the offence must be proven,**_R v Lamb_** and there must be no valid defence,**_R v Scarlett._**
- An intrinsically unlawful act- it cannot be a lawful act which becomes which becomes unlawful only because of the negligent or reckless manner in which it is performed e.g. driving, **_Andrews v DPP_**.
- An act rather than an omission, **_R v Lowe._**

**(3) The unlawful act was dangerous**- an objective test which asks if all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise must subject the other person to, at least, the risk of some harm, albeit not serious harm, **_R v Church_**.
- Physical, not emotional harm but includes shock that produces physical effects, **_Dawson._**
- The sober and reasonable person knows everything they would have known if they had been in the defendant's shoes at the time of the offence, **_Dawson, Watson._**
- The sober and reasonable person has any special knowledge that the defendant has or ought to have known, **_Ball_**.
- Being reasonable, they do not make any unreasonable mistakes made by the defendant,**_Ball_**.

(4) **The unlawful act caused the death of the victim-** the act must have both factually and legally caused the death of the victim. If D:
- directly administers a drug to V, D causes V’s death as consent by the V is no defence- **_Cato._**
- merely supplies V with the drugs, or assists V, D does not cause V’s death, so long as V is a fully informed and responsible adult who freely and voluntarily self-administers, **_Kennedy_**.

## Gross Negligence Manslaughter

This element will consider one of two main forms of involuntary manslaughter: gross negligence manslaughter. Unlike unlawful act manslaughter, there is no requirement that the defendant was involved in a criminal act. The basis of a gross negligence manslaughter charge will be that the defendant has breached a duty of care owed to V. This can be done through a positive act or by an omission which must be considered so bad that it necessitates a criminal charge.

The classic definition of negligence in relation to manslaughter was given in [[R v Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 (CCA)]]:

> '… in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment.'

Defining the precise nature of negligence has proved problematic for the courts. In [[Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576]] the House of Lords summarised the degree of negligence as being close to reckless, but not completely the same, Lord Atkin stated:

> 'Probably of all the epithets that can be applied “reckless” most nearly covers the case … but it is probably not all-embracing, for “reckless” suggests an indifference to risk, whereas the accused may have appreciated the risk and intended to avoid it and yet shown in the means adopted to avoid the risk such a high degree of negligence as would justify a conviction.’

The leading case on gross negligence manslaughter is the House of Lords decision [[R v Adomako [1995] 1 AC 171]].  

```ad-important
It was held that in cases of gross negligence manslaughter, the jury should be directed on gross negligence manslaughter as whether, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount to a criminal act or omission. 
```

In Adomako, the defendant was a locum anaesthetist during an operation to correct a detached retina. He failed to notice that a tube had become dislodged during the course of the operation, and this resulted in the patient being deprived of oxygen. The patient suffered a cardiac arrest and died. The defendant was convicted of manslaughter. Adomako appealed to the House of Lords on the basis that the correct test for this form of manslaughter should be recklessness, not negligence.

The Lords dismissed his appeal and expressed the view that Andrews v DPP had not been overruled by the House, and that, therefore, gross negligence and not recklessness was the correct test for this form of manslaughter. Lord MacKay said (p 296):

> 'In my opinion, the law as stated in these two authorities [Bateman and Andrews] is satisfactory as providing a proper basis for describing the crime of involuntary manslaughter … On this basis, in my opinion the ordinary principles of the law of negligence apply to ascertain whether or not the defendant has been in breach of a duty of care towards the victim who died. If such breach of duty is established, the next question is whether that breach of duty caused the death of the victim.'

## Requirements of Gross Negligence Manslaughter

The basic requirements for gross negligence manslaughter as laid down in Adomako are as follows:

1. the existence of a duty of care;
2. breach of that duty;
3. that the breach causes death;
4. that there was a risk of death; and
5. that the breach of duty was so bad as to amount to 'gross negligence'.

### Duty of Care

Duty of care is essentially given the same meaning it has in the law of tort, and a defendant will owe such a duty towards anyone where harm caused by their acts was foreseeable.

In certain situations, this can be easy to establish, as it is now settled in the law of tort that everyone has a general duty to take care to avoid injury by a positive act to their neighbour.

You also know that liability can arise for an omission in circumstances where the defendant is under a specific duty to act. This duty can arise by statute or by contract. It can also arise as a result of a special relationship between the defendant and the victim, as a result of the defendant's voluntary assumption of a duty of care, or as a result of the defendant creating a dangerous situation.

Even if the defendant's act does not fall neatly in to either category set out above, there may still be liability. The judge will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to go before the jury based on the specific facts of each case.

See:

- [[R v Singh [1999] Crim LR 582]]
- [[R v Ruffell [2003] 2 Cr App R (S) 53]]
- [[R v Wacker [2003] 4 All ER 295]]

#### Breach of Duty of Care

The House of Lords in Adomako held that the ordinary principles of negligence apply in deciding whether the defendant had breached their duty of care. The question is one of whether the defendant's acts fell below the standard expected of a reasonable person.

The reasonable person will be attributed with any special skill used by the defendant. In Adomako the question was whether the defendant's actions had fallen below the standard of a reasonable anaesthetist.

#### The Breach Caused the Death of the Victim

Normal causation principles apply.

#### There Was a Risk of Death

In Adomako, Lord Mackay referred to the risk of death, but then quoted the test in Bateman, which refers to a disregard to the ‘life and safety of others'.

However, in Singh it was held that there must

> ‘be an obvious and serious risk not merely of injury or even serious injury, but of death.’

This obvious and serious risk must be at the time of the breach of duty.

That there must be an obvious and serious risk not merely of injury or even serious injury, but of death was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in [[R v Misra and Srivastava [2005] 1 Cr App R 21]]. Lord Judge stated:

> 'In our judgment, where the issue of risk is engaged, Adomako demonstrates, and it is now clearly established, that it relates to the risk of death, and is not sufficiently satisfied by the risk of bodily injury or injury to health.'

At this point, he does not appear to require an obvious and serious risk. However, later in his judgment he refers to the quote from R v Singh, above, with approval.

In [[R v Rose [2017] EWCA Crim 1168]], the Court of Appeal overturned the conviction of an optometrist due to this element of the offence not being fulfilled.

### The Breach Was Sufficiently Serious to Constitute Gross Negligence

Judges have struggled with how to direct juries to differentiate between negligence causing death justifying a successful civil action for compensation, and negligence, which is sufficiently serious to justify a conviction for manslaughter. In Adomako, the House of Lords acknowledged that the infinite variety of circumstances in which the issue may arise precludes any more precise definition of the distinction and therefore left the issue to the jury with relatively little guidance.

The difficulty of explaining the distinction to a jury between civil negligence and criminal gross negligence is illustrated in [[R v Litchfield [1998] Crim LR 508]].

In order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punishment ([[R v Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 (CCA)]]).

In [[A-G's Ref (No 2 of 1999) [2000] QB 796]] the Court of Appeal held that proof of gross negligence did not require proof of any particular state of mind, and did not require evidence as to the accused's state of mind.

```ad-example
[[Prentice and Sullman]]: Their appeal was heard with **_Adomako_** in the Court of Appeal. Both were junior doctors. P was required to administer a routine lumbar injection to a 16 year old cancer sufferer. He had not done this before and was concerned about whether he should. He consulted the registrar, who arranged for S (who had only done the procedure once) to supervise. S took the wrong drug from a box of drugs provided and handed it to P who injected. Because it was the wrong drug, the patient died from a reaction to it. In the circumstances, the mistakes by the defendants were in part brought about by the failures of others, including the failure of more senior doctors to prepare and advise them or supervise them properly, inadequacies in the way the drugs were stored (different drugs with similar labels in the same box). 

Therefore the mistakes of the defendants were not ‘grossly negligent’ – contrast with **_Singh_** where there were also multiple people responsible but all were experienced and individually able to address the problems.
```

## Conclusions

It is not possible to draw firm conclusions from these cases, given that the issue of what constitutes gross negligence is fact sensitive. However, here are some themes which can be used to guide your application of the law to the facts of any scenario you are given:

- Where the defendant is responsible for a series of acts/omissions rather than a single event, this may make it easier for the jury to find gross negligence, Misra, Litchfield. A single devastating act can be grossly negligent, Adomako.
- Where the defendant's mistakes are themselves in part or in whole brought about by mistakes of others, this may be a reason for not convicting, Prentice & Sullman.
- There can be gross negligence by the defendant, even if others are also responsible for the circumstances leading up to the death, for example where, despite the involvement of others, the defendant has a clear personal responsibility and the ability to discharge it, Singh.
- If the defendant has knowledge/experience that should alert them to the danger, this may be a helpful fact for the jury to take into account: contrast Singh and Litchfield with Prentice & Sullman.
- There is no requirement for any mental state, Adomako. However, the defendant’s state of mind is not irrelevant, e.g., it was a key point in Litchfield that Litchfield would have seen the serious risk of death.
- If someone has seen a high risk of death or has a ‘couldn’t care less’ attitude to a high risk of death, it seems clear that they are highly likely to be convicted.
- The defendant’s state of mind may also work in their favour: if the defendant genuinely did not believe there was a risk, this is a factor that the court can take into account.

```ad-summary
The basic requirements for gross negligence manslaughter as laid down in **_Adomako_** are as follows:
- **The existence of a duty of care-** everyone has a general duty to take care to avoid injury **by a positive act** to their neighbour. Liability can arise for **an omission** in circumstances where the defendant is under a specific duty to act.
- **Breach of that duty-** the question is one of whether the defendant's acts fell below the standard expected of a reasonable person. The reasonable person will be attributed with any special skill used by the defendant.
- **The breach causes death-** factual and legal causation principles apply.
- **There was a risk of death-** there must ‘be an obvious and serious risk not merely of injury or even serious injury, but of death’, **_Singh_**.
- **The breach of duty was so bad as to amount to 'gross negligence’-** whether, having regard to the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission, **_Adomako_**. Factually specific but some themes can be drawn from the case law in this area.
