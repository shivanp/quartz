# Non-fatal offences

This is a hierarchy of non-fatal offences against the person:

- Wounding or grievous bodily harm with intent ([s 18 Offences Against the Person Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/18) ‘OAPA’ 1861)- the most serious offence but committed less frequently;
- Wounding or grievous bodily harm ([s 20 OAPA 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/20));
- Assault occasioning actual bodily harm ([s 47 OAPA 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/47));
- Battery; and
- Assault – the least serious offence but along with battery committed most frequently.

The common law offences are assault and battery.

## Assault

When the victim anticipates the defendant will use violence against them.

- The least serious non-fatal offence as no touching occurs.
- Defined in the ‘common law’ (precedents found in case law).
- The sentence for assault is found in [s 39 Criminal Justice Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/39) which is six months in prison and/ or £5,000 fine.

Criminal liability for assault:

| Element                    | Assault                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actus reus                 | causing the victim to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence                             |
| Mens rea                   | intentionally or recklessly causing the victim to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence |
| Absence of a valid defence | self-defence, intoxication or consent.                                                                                                    |

```ad-defn
title: Assault
Intentionally or recklessly causing another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence ([[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 1 QB 439]]). The House of Lords confirmed this definition of the offence in the case of [[R v Ireland; Burstow [1998] AC 147]].
```

### Actus Reus

- Apprehension
	- Apprehension means to make the victim expect or anticipate but not necessarily fear immediate and unlawful personal violence (contrast [[R v Lamb [1967] 2 QB 981]] and [[Logdon v DPP [1976] Crim LR 121]]).
	- The defendant must do something to make the victim apprehend (i.e. anticipate or believe) they will suffer immediate and unlawful personal violence.
	- There is no need for the defendant to have actually applied force or make physical contact for the offence to be committed.
	- Some words or physical movement from the defendant, causing the victim to think that they are about to be struck, (e.g. raising a fist towards the victim) would be sufficient.
	- Words alone and silence is enough ([[R v Wilson [1955] 1 All ER 744]], [[R v Ireland; Burstow [1998] AC 147]]).
	- Words can however negate an assault ([[Tuberville v Savage (1669) 1 Mod Rep 3]]).
- Immediate
	- The victim must believe that immediate violence will be inflicted upon them. Apprehension that the force might be applied sometime in the future would be insufficient.
	- However, the courts have developed a rather generous interpretation of 'immediacy’. The courts have not interpreted ‘immediate’ to mean instantaneous.
	- In [[R v Constanza [1997] 2 Cr App R 492]], immediate was held to mean apprehension of personal violence at some time not excluding the immediate future. The victim in this case thought that personal violence could happen at any time as D had been following her, calling her and sending over 800 letters to her home.
	- In [[R v Ireland; Burstow [1998] AC 147]], Lord Steyn equated immediate with imminent.
	- [[Smith v Chief Superintendent, Woking Police Station (1983) 76 Cr App R 234]]
- Unlawful
	- Not done in self-defence or with the victim’s consent.
- Personal violence
	- The Court of Appeal, in *Ireland*, suggested that 'violence' could include a threat of psychological as well as physical damage.
	- This view was expressly rejected by Lord Hope in the House of Lords. It would appear that, where the apprehension is of immediate psychological harm, charges under other statutes, such as the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, may be more suitable.
	- It is, therefore, clear that, for an assault, the victim must apprehend physical violence.
	- It should be noted that, where the assault results in psychological harm which is more than trivial, the defendant will be liable for the more serious offence under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, s 47.
	- All the victim has to anticipate is an unwanted touch.

### Mens Rea

The defendant intends or is reckless as to causing the victim to apprehend immediate unlawful personal violence ([[R v Venna [1975] 3 WLR 737]])

- Assault is a basic intent crime, meaning it can be committed intentionally or recklessly.
- A defendant intends an assault if it was D’s aim or purpose ([[R v Moloney [1985] 1 All ER 1025 (HL)]]).
- A defendant is reckless as to an assault if they:
	- see a risk that their actions will cause the victim to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence; and
	- in the circumstances known to D, it was unreasonable to take that risk (R v G).

The case of [[R v Savage; Parmenter [1992] 1 AC 714 (HL)]] confirmed the view that subjective recklessness (as now set out in R v G) must be established for any assault charge based upon recklessness.

## Battery

The defendant touches the victim in an unwanted fashion.

- Defined in the common law.
- The sentence is contained in s 39 Criminal Justice Act 1988.
- Maximum penalty of 6 months in prison and/ or £5,000 fine.

```ad-defn
title: Battery
A battery is the actual intended use of unlawful force to another person without consent, [[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1969] 1 QB 439]] The House of Lords confirmed this definition in the case of [[R v Ireland; Burstow [1998] AC 147]] and further confirmed that it includes the reckless application of force.

So battery is an act by which a person intentionally or recklessly applies unlawful force on another.
```

| Element                    | Battery                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Actus reus                 | application of unlawful force                      |
| Mens rea                   | intentionally or recklessly applies unlawful force |
| Absence of a valid defence | self-defence, intoxication or consent                                                   |

### Actus Reus

- Application
	- Battery can be inflicted:
		- Directly ([[Collins v Wilcock [1984] 3 All ER 374]]).
		- Indirectly ([[R v Martin (1881) 8 QBD 54]], [[DPP v K [1990] 1 WLR 1067]]).
		- By an omission ([[DPP v Santana-Bermudez [2003] EWHC 2908]]).
- Unlawful
	- Means that the battery isn’t done in self-defence or with V’s consent, for example.
	- Consent can be express or implied consent to inevitable everyday contact ([[Collins v Wilcock [1984] 3 All ER 374]]).
- Force
	- Means physical contact or force. The merest touch is enough and doesn’t have to be rude, hostile or aggressive ([[Faulkner v Talbot [1981] 3 All ER 468]]).
	- Touching someone’s clothes is enough ([[R v Thomas]]).
	- Where the battery results in harm which is more than trivial, the defendant will be liable for the more serious offence under the OAPA 1861, s 47.
	- Force includes the merest touching
		- 'The fundamental principle, plain and incontestable, is that every person's body is inviolate … Any touching of another person, however slight, may amount to a battery.' (Goff LJ, [[Collins v Wilcock [1984] 3 All ER 374]])
		- '… there could be no dispute that if you touch a person’s clothes while he's wearing them that is equivalent to touching them.' (Ackner LJ, [[R v Thomas (1985) 81 Cr App R 331]])
		- A battery is an intentional touching of another person without the consent of that person and without lawful excuse. It need not necessarily be hostile, or rude, or aggressive as some of the cases seem to indicate (Lord Lane CJ, [[Faulkner v Talbot [1981] 3 All ER 468]])
	- The application of force need not be aggressive, and an omission can constitute force ([[DPP v Santana-Bermudez [2003] EWHC 2908]])
	- The force need not be applied directly
		- Most batteries are inflicted directly e.g. by the defendant hitting the victim with or without a weapon. Throwing a missile at the victim is also considered to be a direct application of force. However, a battery can be indirect ([[R v Martin (1881) 8 QBD 54]], [[DPP v K [1990] 1 WLR 1067]])

### Mens Rea

> ‘In our view, the element of mens rea in the offence of battery is satisfied by proof that the defendant intentionally or recklessly applied force to the person of another … We see no reason in logic or law why a person who recklessly applies physical force to the person of another should be outside the criminal law …'  
> James LJ, [[R v Venna [1976] QB 421]]

Battery is therefore a basic intent crime as it can be committed recklessly.

| Offence | Examples                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assault | Threat of violence, victim anticipates violence but no physical touching. Some words or physical movement from D would be sufficient. Silence in some cases is sufficient. |
| Battery | Mere touch, an unwanted kiss, a slap, scratches/grazes, minor bruising, superficial cuts.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## S 47: Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm

[s 47 OAPA 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/47):

> 'Whosoever shall be convicted on indictment of any assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be liable … to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding five years.'

| Element    | Assault occasioning actual bodily harm                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Actus reus | Assault (meaning assault or battery), occasioning (normal principles of causation apply), actual bodily harm |
| Mens rea   | Intention or recklessness as to causing the victim to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence, or applying unlawful force on another.                                                                                                             |

- Assault
	- This has been interpreted to mean that there must be either an assault or battery: [[ DPP v Little [1992] QB 645]] and [[R v Ireland; Burstow [1998] AC 147]].
	- Both the actus reus and the mens rea of either an assault or battery must be established.
- Occasioning
	- The assault or battery must 'occasion actual bodily harm'. In other words, the assault or battery must result in actual bodily harm being caused to the victim. Normal principles of causation apply.
	- This offence can also be committed through an omission, [[DPP v Santana-Bermudez [2003] EWHC 2908]].
- Actual bodily harm
	- The definition of actual bodily harm includes 'any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort’ of the victim, and this hurt need not be serious or permanent but must be more than transient and trifling ([[R v Donovan [1934] 2 KB 498]])
	- In [[R v Chan-Fook [1994] 1 WLR 689]] the Court of Appeal overturned a conviction as the trial judge directing the jury had omitted the words ‘hurt or injury’ and said it would be actual bodily harm if the victim’s health or comfort was interfered with.
	- A momentary loss of consciousness was held to be capable of amounting to actual bodily harm as it involved an injurious impairment of the victim's sensory functions ([[T v DPP [2003] Crim LR 622]]).
	- Subsequent consideration of what can amount to 'actual bodily harm' has been given in the case of [[DPP v Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin)]] and it seems that the type of harm which can be included has extended yet further.
	- Actual bodily harm was held to include psychiatric injury in [[R v Chan-Fook [1994] 1 WLR 689]], though “… it does not include mere emotions such as fear or distress or panic nor does it include, as such, states of mind that are not themselves evidence of some identifiable clinical condition.”

### Mens Rea

In the OAPA 1861, s 47:

- no mens rea is required for the actual bodily harm;
- all that is required is the mens rea for the assault or the battery.

> 'Can a verdict of assault occasioning actual bodily harm be returned upon proof of an assault together with proof that actual bodily harm was occasioned by the assault, or must the prosecution also prove that the defendant intended to cause some actual bodily harm or was reckless as to whether such harm would be caused? The verdict of assault occasioning actual bodily harm may be returned upon proof of an assault together with proof of the fact that actual bodily harm was occasioned by the assault. The prosecution are not obliged to prove that the defendant intended to cause some actual bodily harm or was reckless as to whether such harm would be caused.'  
> Lord Ackner, [[R v Savage, R v Parmenter [1992] 1 AC 699]]

## S 20: Malicious Wounding or Inflicting Grievous Bodily Harm

The OAPA 1861, s 20 provides:

> 'Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument, shall be guilty of an offence …’

Note that s 20 creates two offences:

- malicious wounding; and
- maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Note that “maliciously” means intention or Cunningham recklessness ([[R v Venna [1976] QB 421]]) as to causing some harm, not necessarily to cause the specific serious harm that has resulted ([[R v Grimshaw [1984] Crim. L.R. 108]], [[R v Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421]])

| Element    | Details                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Actus reus | Wound, or infliction of grievous bodily harm. |
| Mens rea   | D must intend or be reckless as to the causing of some harm.                                              |

### Wound

In [[C (a minor) v Eisenhower [1984] QB 331]] it was held that the rupture of blood vessels internally is not sufficient to constitute a wound. There must be a break in the continuity of both layers of the skin. Both the dermis and epidermis must be broken.

It is important to realise that if there is proof of a wounding, the actual injury need not be severe; any breaking of the skin will suffice.

As ‘maliciously’ is an adverb, the word ‘wound’ as in the section is a verb. Wound (a verb) means to cause a wound (a noun).

Normally the wounding will be such that causation will not be an issue. Occasionally, however, it may be, for example where:

- D chases the victim, causing them to fall and cut their head; or
- D throws a knife and V tries to intercept it.

### Infliction of Grievous Bodily Harm

This word has proved difficult to determine in the past due to questions as to what was necessary to amount to an 'infliction', i.e. was an assault a pre-requisite?

Essentially infliction now bears the same meaning as 'cause' and the normal rules of causation should apply.

| Case                                   | Ratio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[R v Wilson [1984] AC 242]]           | It was decided that there could be an infliction of grievous bodily harm contrary to the OAPA 1861, s 20 without an assault being committed.                                                                                                                                           |
| [[R v Burstow [1997] 1 Cr. App. R. 144]]                        | Where the accused made nuisance telephone calls, but never actually attacked the victim. The House of Lords upheld the conviction for inflicting grievous bodily harm (psychological injury). The House of Lords held that 'inflict' did not require an assault to be committed first. |
| [[DPP v Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (Admin)]] | The House of Lords held that the words 'grievous bodily harm' simply mean 'really serious harm'. In [[Saunders [1985] Crim LR 230]], it was decided that it would not be a misdirection to leave out the word 'really'; the words 'serious harm' would suffice.                             |
| [[R v Ireland; Burstow [1998] AC 147]] | Psychiatric injury may amount to GBH if sufficiently serious, but its cause and effect will need to be proved by expert evidence.                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[R v Bollom (2004) 2 Cr App R 6]]     | The Court of Appeal held that, in deciding whether or not the injuries sustained were 'grievous', the jury should consider the effect of the injuries on the victim, taking into account the victim's age and health. The jury can also look at the totality of the injuries. This case concerned a baby with multiple cuts and bruises which on their own would not have been enough, but taken together, could amount to serious harm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Mens Rea

D must intend or be reckless as to the causing of harm. The issue is the extent of the harm that must be intended or foreseen.

In [[R v Savage, R v Parmenter [1992] 1 AC 699]], The House of Lords reaffirmed the interpretation of maliciously as laid down [[R v Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421]]:

> 'It is quite unnecessary that the accused should have foreseen that his unlawful act might cause physical harm of the gravity described in the section, i.e., a wound or serious physical injury. It is enough that he [foresaw] … that some physical harm to some person, albeit of a minor character, might result.' (Per Lord Diplock.)

## S 18: Wounding or Causing Grievous Bodily Harm with Intent

The OAPA 1861, s 18 provides:

> 'Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause grievous bodily harm to any person, with intent … to do some grievous bodily harm to any person … shall be guilty of an offence …'

Again, note that the OAPA 1861, s 18 creates two offences:

- malicious wounding with intent to cause GBH; and
- maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause GBH.

| Element    | Offence                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Actus reus | Wound, or causing grievous bodily harm |
| Mens rea   | D must intend to cause grievous bodily harm.                                       |

### Actus Reus

- Wound
	- This bears the same meaning as under the OAPA 1861, s 20 so there must be a break in the continuity of both layers of the skin. Both the dermis and epidermis must be broken. Any breaking of the skin will suffice, [[C (a minor) v Eisenhower [1984] QB 331]]
- Causation
	- Traditionally, it was accepted that the word 'cause' was wider than that of 'inflict' used under the OAPA 1861, s 20.
	- However, since the case of Wilson, there appears to be little significance in the use of different words under the OAPA 1861, ss 20 and 18 and the normal rules of causation apply.
- Grievous bodily harm
	- This bears the same meaning as under the OAPA 1861, s 20 so serious harm, Saunders.

### Mens Rea

The mens rea element is the key distinguishing feature between the OAPA 1861, ss 18 and 20. Under the OAPA 1861, s 20 it is enough to intend or foresee (i.e. be reckless as to) some harm, however slight. For the OAPA 1861, s 18 the defendant must actually intend to cause harm which amounts in law to grievous bodily harm (serious harm). Recklessness is not enough.

```ad-important
Where the actus reus is a wound, the mens rea is still intention to cause GBH. Intention to wound is not enough.
```

Intention can be direct (aim, purpose, R v Moloney) or oblique, [[R v Woollin]]. Juries are not entitled to find s 18 by oblique intent unless they feel sure:

- serious injury was a virtual certainty as a result of the defendant’s action (objective element); and
- the defendant appreciated that (subjective element).

```ad-example
- GBH
	- Permanent loss of sensory function
	- Permanent disability
	- Broken bones
	- Fractured skull
	- Substantial blood loss
- Wound- breaking both layers of skin, the dermis and epidermis
```
