# Omissions

## General Rule

The general rule is that a defendant cannot be criminally liable for a failure to act, as there is no general duty to act to prevent harm â€“ [[R v Smith (William) (1826) 2 C&P 449]]:

> 'Omission, without a duty, will not create an indictable offence.'

This element will examine the circumstances in which a defendant may commit the actus reus of an offence and be convicted because they have omitted or failed to act when under a duty to do so.

## Criminal Liability

In order to secure a conviction based upon a failure to act, the prosecution must prove that:

1. the crime is one which is capable of being committed by an omission. Some offences can only be committed by an act, e.g. unlawful act manslaughter ([[R v Lowe [1973] QB 702]])
2. the accused was under a legal duty to act;
3. the accused breached that duty;
4. the breach caused the actus reus of the offence to occur; and
5. should the offence so require, that the accused had the required mens rea.

This element will concentrate on the second of these requirements, so that you will be able to establish whether a legal duty to act exists. Common situations when the defendant will be under a legal duty to act are by: statute, special relationship, voluntary assumption, contract, the defendant creating a dangerous situation or public office. These principles of law can then be applied to offences such as gross negligence manslaughter.

## Legal Duties to Act

There are situations in which a legal duty to act is imposed.

### Statutory Duty to Act

Under statutes, innumerable offences can be committed by an omission.

Many examples can be found in the less serious/summary only offences. Such an example can be found in the [Road Traffic Act 1988, s 6(4)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/6), where it is an offence to fail to provide a specimen of breath.

### Duty to Act in Special Relationships

Examples of special relationships are:

- doctors and patients
- parents and their children
	- [[R v Gibbons and Proctor (1918) 13 Cr App R 134]]
	- [[Re A (Children (Conjoined Twins) [2000] 4 All ER 961 (CA)]]
- spouses
	- [[R v Hood [2004] 1 Cr App R (S) 431]]

### Voluntary Assumption of Responsibility

A person is not generally under a duty to care for another in distress. However, if a person voluntarily assumes a duty towards another, the law will hold that person liable if they fail to carry out that duty.

The basis on which the courts have held a voluntary assumption of a duty of care to exist is often factually specific as can be seen by the cases that follow:

- [[R v Nicholls (1874) 13 Cox CC 75]]
- [[R v Gibbons and Proctor (1918) 13 Cr App R 134]]
- [[R v Instan [1893] 1 QB 450]]
- [[R v Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB 354]]
- [[R v Ruffell [2003] EWCA Crim 122]]

### Breach of Contractual Duty

The duty can be owed by the defendant either to the party with whom the defendant is contracted or to a third party.

[[R v Pittwood (1902) 19 TLR 37]].

### Defendant Creates Dangerous Situation

If a person accidently started a fire in a house, the person has a duty to take reasonable steps to counteract the dangerous situation created. The steps need only be reasonable, so a person would not be expected to risk their own life to save the lives of others, but they would be expected to take reasonable steps, such as summoning help, warning any occupants of the house that it is on fire, and so on.

- [[R v Miller [1983] 2 AC 161]]
- [[R v Evans [2009] 1 WLR 1999]]

### Public Office Holders

[[R v Dytham [1979] QB 722]]

## Omissions and Causation

- The relationship between omissions and causation in this context means that if the defendant had acted, D could have made a causal difference.
- The defendant cannot cause by omission.
- The defendant can fail to uncause when D has a duty to uncause, but this is different to causing.

```ad-example
If V self-injects dangerous drugs into their own arm and suffers an overdose, the cause of V's death is their own act of self-injection. The drugs are causing V to die. But if the supplier of the drug is present when V overdoses, the supplier will have a duty to try to uncause what V has caused.
```
