# Causation

## Aspects

There are two aspects to causation, both of which must be proved by the prosecution:

- Factual causation – the jury must be satisfied that the acts or omissions of the accused were in fact the cause of the relevant consequence.
- Legal causation – it must be established that the acts or omissions of the accused were a legal cause of that consequence.

In deciding the issue of causation, the jury must apply legal principles.

### Killing

While the general rules on causation are relevant to all result crimes, we will study this law within the offences of murder and involuntary manslaughter here.

The _actus reus_ of murder is the ‘unlawful killing of a human being under the Queen’s Peace’.

The word ‘killing’ suggests that murder is a result crime which requires the prosecution to show that the defendant’s acts or omissions caused the death of the victim.

To do this, the tests of factual and legal causation must be satisfied.

### Factual Causation

It must be proved that but for the acts or omissions of the accused, the relevant consequence would not have occurred in the way that it did, [[R v White [1910] 2 KB 124]].

See also [[R v Dyson (1908)]].

### Legal Causation

The law will step in to prevent a person from being responsible for all acts that arise from their actions. For example, if X asks Y to a party and on the way to the party Y is stabbed by Z, it is clear that, but for X's invitation, Y would not have been on the way to the party, which led Y to being stabbed by Z. However, X should not be held responsible for the stabbing, and will not be the legal cause of the attack.

The law will check the culpability of the defendant before imposing liability, and it will require that the defendant is the ‘operating and substantial’ cause of the prohibited consequence: [[R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr App R 279]].

#### Key Principles

When determining the legal cause, the law may have regard to some of the following factors. The key legal causation principles are:

- The defendant's act must be the 'substantial' cause of the prohibited harm, [[R v Hughes [2013] UKSC 56]].
- The consequence must be caused by the defendant's culpable act, [[R v Dalloway (1847) 2 Cox CC]].
- The defendant's act need not be the only cause of the prohibited consequence, [[R v Benge (1865) 4 F & F 504]].

```ad-example
A woman pulls a gun on a man who runs into the road, gets hit by a van and dies. Did the woman cause the man’s death?

Factual causation

‘But for’ the woman pulling a gun on the man, the man would not have run into the road, got hit by a car and died, R v White. The woman is the factual cause of the man’s death.

Legal causation

The woman is the substantial cause of the man’s death as she was more than a minimal cause, R v Hughes. She does not have to be the only cause of the man’s death, so it doesn’t matter that it was the van that actually struck the man, R v Benge.
```

## Novus Actus Interveniens

A novus actus interveniens is a subsequent event or act of either the victim or a third party which renders the defendant’s part in the consequence very small, breaking the chain of causation and meaning that the defendant is not criminally liable.

The courts have been required to consider the question of whether the chain of causation has been broken in a number of different contexts such as:

- medical negligence
- acts of a third party
- acts of the victim
- thin skull rule
- natural events.

### Medical Negligence

- Only if an intervening act is so overwhelming as to make the original act part of the history can it break the chain of causation: [[R v Smith (1959) 2 QB 35]]
- Overall, the courts are reluctant to allow medical malpractice to break the chain of causation: [[R v Cheshire [1991] 3All ER 670]]

### Acts of Third Parties

There may only be a break in the chain of causation if the actions of the third party were 'free, deliberate and informed' ([[R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr App R 279]]).

### Acts of the Victim

There are three types of acts of the victim that we will consider:

- ‘fright and flight’ cases
- refusing medical treatment
- suicide.

#### 'Fright and Flight'

When under attack or the threat of attack from the defendant, it is plausible to consider that the victim may attempt to escape from the attack or threat. However, it has been necessary for the law to consider when such escape attempts can amount to a _novus actus interveniens_.

The issue falls around the question as to whether the escape was foreseeable by the reasonable person. If it is not, then the defendant is entitled to an acquittal and is no longer deemed to be the legal cause of the prohibited result.

From the case of [[R v Roberts (1972) 56 Cr App R 95 (CA)]], in determining whether the victim's action was a foreseeable mode of escape, the jury would essentially have the same knowledge as the defendant had at the time D committed the act. As the court in [[R v Williams and Davis [1992] 1 WLR 380]] approved the case of _Roberts_ it is generally believed that the characteristics Stuart Smith LJ was referring to were those characteristics which would be visible to a reasonable man present at the time of the defendant’s act.

#### Refusing Medical Treatment

The courts have also considered what the position would be where the victim refuses medical treatment, which results in their death.

Cases:

- [[R v Blaue [1975] 1 WLR 1411]]
- [[R v Holland (1841) 2 Mood & R 351]]
- [[R v Dear [1996] Crim LR 595 (CA)]]

#### Suicide

Whether a victim’s suicide has been caused by the defendant is a question of fact that juries should apply their common sense to, [[R v Wallace [2018] EWCA Crim 690]].

The victim’s suicide may not break the chain of causation if:

- V nonetheless dies from the original wound, [[R v Dear [1996] Crim LR 595 (CA)]]; or
- the act was reasonably foreseeable, e.g., where the defendant causes a brilliant pianist to lose her fingers, or a keen sportsman to be paralysed (applying the rule in [[R v Roberts (1972) 56 Cr App R 95 (CA)]] and [[R v Williams and Davis [1992] 1 WLR 380]]); or
- the D’s unlawful act was a significant and operating cause of death and at the time of the attack it was reasonably foreseeable that the victim would die by suicide as a result of V’s injuries, [[R v Wallace [2018] EWCA Crim 690]].

The victim’s suicide may break the chain of causation if:

- the injuries inflicted by the defendant have healed, but the victim goes on to die by suicide (distinguishing [[R v Dear [1996] Crim LR 595 (CA)]]); or
- it was a voluntary and informed decision of the victim to act, [[R v Kennedy (No 2) [2007] UKHL 38]].

### Thin Skull Rule

The 'thin skull' rule provides that a person who inflicts harm on another cannot escape liability if the victim, owing to some pre-existing infirmity or peculiarity, suffers greater harm than would have been expected as a result of what the accused has done.

Put simply, the defendant must take the victim as they find them ([[R v Hayward [1908] 21 Cox 692]]).

See also [[R v Blaue [1975] 1 WLR 1411]].

### Natural Events

Natural events will only break the chain of causation if they are 'extraordinary' and not reasonably foreseeable.

For example, if D knocks V unconscious and leaves V on the beach then V is drowned by the incoming tide, D has legally caused V's death. The natural event of the tide coming in is reasonably foreseeable.

### Test to Use

When dealing with a situation that is similar to facts of previously decided cases, reference should be made to the relevant case for direction on what is required for the new intervening act to break the chain of causation. Usually this will be straightforward. However, in the event of new situations arising, the Court of Appeal in [[R v Girdler [2009] EWCA 2666]] has directed use of common sense when deciding which test to use.
