# Inchoate offences

## Introduction

'Inchoate' means unfinished or incomplete. An inchoate offence occurs when the defendant takes some steps towards committing a crime, but the full offence is not committed.

We have inchoate offences to prevent harm, to people or property, for example. It allows the police to arrest a person for attempted criminal damage, for example, before any damage actually occurs.

We will consider attempts to commit a crime in this element. An attempted offence is when a defendant has not completed a crime but has taken enough steps that the behaviour becomes criminal, such as attempted murder.

There are other types of inchoate offences, such as conspiracy to commit a crime, but that is beyond the scope of this module.

## Scope

Merely thinking you will commit a criminal offence is not enough to be liable for an inchoate offence. The defendant’s conduct must reach a certain threshold that warrants criminal liability.

If you thought about punching a colleague (a battery) but you don’t act on that thought, you won’t be criminally liable for an inchoate offence.

Even if you tried to find out where that colleague is in your building and thought about how to avoid the video cameras, this preparation and planning won’t make you criminally liable for an offence.

Once you take steps to do so, an inchoate offence occurs (an attempt), as the safety of your colleague is at risk.

## Elements

Criminal liability for an attempt:

| Element                    | Attempt                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Actus reus                 | An act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of an offence.                                    |
| Mens rea                   | An intention to commit the full offence e.g. for attempted murder, the defendant must have an intention to kill. |
| Absence of a valid defence | A defendant cannot be convicted for a non-existent crime, Taaffe.                                                |

Attempting to commit a crime was a long-standing common-law offence, however it has now been reformed though legislation.

```ad-statute
title: Criminal Attempts Act 1981 (CAA 1981) s 1

(1) If, with intent to commit an offence to which this section applies, a person does an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of an offence, he is guilty of an attempt to commit that offence.

(2) A person may be guilty of an attempt to commit an offence to which this section applies even though the facts are such that the commission of the offence is impossible.

(3) In any case where:
- (a) apart from this subsection a person's intention would not be regarded as having amounted to an intent to commit an offence; but
- (b) if the facts of the case had been as he believed them to be, his intention would be so regarded.
then, for the purposes of subsection (1) above, he shall be regarded as having had an intent to commit that offence.
```

### Actus Reus

> 'An act which is more than merely preparatory.'

The question of whether the actions of the accused are more than merely preparatory is one of fact to be decided by the jury, providing the judge is satisfied that the actions are capable of being more than merely preparatory: Criminal Attempts Act 1981, s 4(3).

There are no clear rules on whether conduct is merely preparatory (not an attempt) or more than merely preparatory (an attempt) so we must look to case law for guidance.

In [[R v Gullefer [1990] 3 All ER 82]] Lord Lane CJ stated:

> 'An attempt begins when the merely preparatory acts come to an end and the defendant embarks on the crime proper or the actual commission of the offence.’

> [!example]  
> Not an attempt - merely preparatory
> - Being outside a post office with a threatening note and fake gun (not attempted robbery, [[R v Campbell (1990) 93 Cr App R 350]])
> - Being in school toilets with a knife and rope but no schoolchildren (not attempted false imprisonment, [[R v Geddes [1996] Crim LR 894]])
>
> Attempt - more than merely preparatory
> - Getting into a car with a loaded gun and pointing it at the victim (attempted murder, [[R v Jones (1990) 91 Cr App R 351]])
> - Looking at a padlock with cutting equipment in the hedge (attempted burglary, [[R v Tosti [1997] Crim LR 746]])

### Mens Rea

The accused must intend to bring about the consequences required for the full offence.

This can be illustrated by the case of [[R v Whybrow [1951] 35 Cr App R 141]]. The mens rea of murder is intention to kill or intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Here, the charge was attempted murder, and therefore it was necessary to prove that the defendant intended to kill. Intention to cause grievous bodily harm was not enough for attempted murder.

In [[R v Toole]] it was held that if the substantive offence has the mens rea of either intention or recklessness as to the actus reus, to convict of the attempted offence proof of intention is required.

The charge in this case was attempted arson, and no property was burnt. It was necessary to show an intention to damage property by fire.

#### Oblique Intent

In [[R v Walker & Hayles (1989) 90 Cr App R 226]] the court held that the jury may (but do not necessarily have to) find intention where they are satisfied that the defendant foresaw the result as a virtual certainly.

#### Conditional Intent

A conditional intention counts as an intention. So where a defendant only intends to commit an offence subject to certain condition(s), the defendant will still have the sufficient mens rea for an attempt, [[AG's Ref (Nos 1 & 2 of 1979) [1980] QB 180]].

An example of this type of intention is where D picks up a bag and looks through it, but decides that there is nothing worth taking. D could be convicted of attempted theft as they have the intention to steal.

#### Intention to Achieve Only What is Missing From the Full Offence

What if the mens rea of the offence includes an element which does not relate to the actus reus? The mens rea for an attempt to commit this offence is then an intention to achieve what is missing from the actus reus, plus rest of the mens rea for the full offence. This principle applies to attempted aggravated criminal damage. Illustrated as follows.

> [!example]  
> Aggravated criminal damage (full offence)  
> _Actus reus:_
> - Damage to property
>
> _Mens rea:_
> - Intention or recklessness as to damaging property
> - Intention or recklessness as to endangering life by the damage
>
> **Attempted** aggravated criminal damage  
> _Actus reus:_
> - More than merely preparatory act
>
> _Mens rea:_
> - **Intention** to damage property  
> Intention to achieve what is missing from the _actus reus_. D must intend to bring about the consequences required for the full offence. Recklessness is not enough for this part of the _mens rea._
> - Intention **or recklessness** as to endangering life by the damage  
> _Mens rea_ which does not relate to the _actus reus. Mens rea_ for the full offence. Recklessness is sufficient for this part of the _mens rea_.

See also [[Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1992 [1994] 2 All ER 121]]: the defendant had the state of mind for the full offence and they intended to do the physical element which was missing.

### Impossibility

Where a defendant sets out to commit a crime, which is in fact impossible to commit, can the prosecution nevertheless seek D’s conviction for an attempt or will the impossibility of committing the full offence provide a defence?

There are three main types of impossibility:

- non-existent crime;
- through inadequacy; and
- in fact.

#### Non-existent Crime

This arises where the accused believes that what they are doing is an offence, whereas it is in fact lawful.

You cannot turn a lawful act into an unlawful act. Therefore a prosecutor, seeking to convict a defendant of an offence, relying on the defendant's intent to do something else which is not in itself a crime, will not succeed: [[R v Taaffe [1983] 2 All ER 625]].

#### Impossibility Through Inadequacy

Impossibility through inadequacy arises where the crime itself is perfectly feasible, but the defendants adopt, or seek to adopt, a method that cannot work, e.g., 'poisoning' someone with a substance that, unknown to them is harmless, or trying to open a bombproof safe with explosives which cannot blow it open.

Logic clearly shows that such an argument cannot succeed in any situation: a defendant who sets out to kill should not get off simply because they choose a method that is doomed to fail. Such a defendant will be convicted of an appropriate inchoate offence such as attempted murder.

#### Impossibility in Fact

The [Criminal Attempts Act 1981, s 1(2) & (3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/47/section/1) in relation to statutory attempt have reversed the common law position on impossibility in fact. This is now no longer a defence to attempt.

So, for example, if D stabs V, but V is already dead, then D will be liable for attempted murder.

This is illustrated in the House of Lords case of [[R v Shivpuri [1987] AC 1]].

> [!summary]  
> The _actus reus_ element of an attempt is ‘an act which is more than merely preparatory’. The jury will decide if the defendant’s conduct was more than merely preparatory. There are no clear rules on whether conduct is merely preparatory (not an attempt) or more than merely preparatory (an attempt). Guidance can be taken from case law such as:
> - Not an attempt - Being outside a post office with a threatening note and fake gun (not attempted robbery, **_Campbell_**)
> - Attempt - Getting into a car with a loaded gun and pointing it at the victim (attempted murder, **_Jones_**)
>
> The _mens rea_ element of an attempt is an intention to commit the full offence, e.g., with attempted murder, the defendant must have an intention to kill.
>
> Impossibility through inadequacy and in fact is no defence to an attempt (**s 1(2)&(3) Criminal Attempts Act 1981**) e.g., if you try to poison someone with a substance that unknown to you is harmless you could still be criminally liable for attempted murder. However, a defendant cannot be convicted for attempting a non-existent crime, **_Taaffe_.**
