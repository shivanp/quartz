# Diminished responsibility

## Introduction

- Diminished responsibility is one of the two special defences to murder. ‘Special defence’ means diminished responsibility can only be used as a defence to murder, no other offences.
- Diminished responsibility is a partial defence, meaning if it is successful, the defendant is not acquitted but convicted of a lesser offence, known as voluntary manslaughter, [Homicide Act (HA) 1957, s2(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/11/section/2). This means that the judge will have discretion in sentencing and the defendant will avoid the mandatory life sentence handed down to those convicted of murder ([Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1965/71/contents).
- The burden falls upon the defence to prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant was acting under diminished responsibility: s 2(2) HA 1957.
- Diminished responsibility is not available as a defence to a charge of attempted murder, [[R v Campbell [1987] 84 Cr App R 255]]. But didn't seem to be attempted murder??

```ad-statute
title: [Homicide Act 1957, s 2(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/11/section/2) (as amended by the [Coroners and Justice Act (CJA) 2009, s 52](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/52))

(1) A person ("D") who kills or is a party to the killing of another is not to be convicted of murder if D was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which-
(a) arose from a recognised medical condition,
(b) substantially impaired D's ability to do one or more of the things mentioned in subsection (1A), and
(c) provides an explanation for D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.
(1A) Those things are—
(a) to understand the nature of D's conduct;
(b) to form a rational judgment;
(c) to exercise self-control.
(1B) For the purposes of subsection (1)(c), an abnormality of mental functioning provides an explanation for D's conduct if it causes, or is a significant contributory factor in causing, D to carry out that conduct.’
```

We will consider four key aspects to diminished responsibility:

- Abnormality of mental functioning
- Recognised medical condition
- Substantial impairment of D’s ability to do one or more things
- Provides an explanation for D’s acts and omissions.

### An 'abnormality of Mental Functioning'

[The Coroners and Justice Act (CJA) 2009](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/contents) made modest reforms to the language of diminished responsibility, for example requiring an abnormality of mental functioning rather than an abnormality of mind.

In the absence of any statutory definition, guidance on the meaning of abnormality of mental functioning is taken from [[R v Byrne [1960] 2 QB 396]]. A defendant would be suffering from an abnormality of the mind if they had a 'state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal’.

### Arising From a Recognised Medical Condition

- This clause has hugely simplified the defence but it is not completely straightforward.
- A defendant might be suffering from an undiagnosed recognised medical condition at the time of the killing which will be sufficient to satisfy this element.
- It is not enough to be suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning and have a recognised medical condition. The abnormality must be caused by the recognised medical condition and not by something else, such as hatred, jealousy or bad temper.
- Alcohol Dependency Syndrome (ADS) is a recognised medical condition.
	- [[R v Dowds [2012] EWCA Crim 281]]

### Substantial Impairment of D’s Ability

The abnormality of mental functioning must have substantially impaired the defendant's ability to do one of the things stated within the HA 1957, s 2(1A).

The meaning of ‘substantially’ was considered by the Supreme Court in [[R v Golds [2016] UKSC 61]]. Substantially means ‘more than merely trivial’. **_Golds_** also said that it was not enough that his ability was substantially impaired. It must be substantially impaired by the abnormality of mental functioning.

The impact is not substantial if it had not made any great difference ([[R v Simcox [1964] Crim LR 402]])

```ad-example
- **Law Commission, Report No 304** provided the following examples:

- A boy aged 10 who has been left to play very violent video games for hours on end for much of his life, loses his temper and kills another child when the child attempts to take a game from him. When interviewed, he shows no real understanding that, when a person is killed they cannot simply be later revived, as happens in the games he has been continually playing.

- A woman suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, following violent abuse suffered at her husband's hands, comes to believe that only burning her husband to death will rid the world of his sins.

- A mentally sub-normal boy believes that he must follow his older brother’s instructions, even when they involve taking take part in a killing. He says, "I wouldn’t dream of disobeying my brother and he would never tell me to do something if it was really wrong“.

- A depressed man who has been caring for many years for a terminally ill spouse, kills her, at her request. He found it progressively more difficult to stop her repeated requests dominating his thoughtsA man says that sometimes the devil takes control of him and implants in him a desire to kill, a desire that must be acted on before the devil will go away.
```

### To Exercise Self-control

The question of whether the defendant's ability is substantially impaired is one of fact and is for the jury to decide, however, guidance can be taken from the above examples. The above definitions tend to allow the jury a wide discretion, and much will depend on the extent to which the jury feel the defendant is morally culpable.

### Provides an Explanation for D’s Acts and Omissions

The abnormality of mental functioning:

- Must provide an explanation for D's acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing, s 2(1)(c); and
- Provides an explanation for D's conduct if it causes, or is a significant contributory factor in causing, D to carry out that conduct, s 2(1B) CJA 2009.

A causal link between the abnormality of mental functioning arising from a recognised medical condition and the killing must be established. It is clear from the wording of this section that it need not be the only cause. The defence can still operate, even if the jury consider that alcohol may have played a part, [[R v Dietschmann [2003] 1 AC 1209]]. Another element will cover this in more detail.

### Medical Experts

All four of the elements of the defence are concerned with psychiatric matters ([[R v Brennan [2014] EWCA Crim 2387]]).

### Summary

- Once the D has fulfilled the actus reus and mens rea of murder, D’s conviction can be reduced to voluntary manslaughter (s 2(3)), if D proves, on the balance of probabilities, that they were acting under diminished responsibility, [s 2(2) HA 1957](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/5-6/11/section/2) Medical evidence will be helpful for all elements of the defence, [[R v Brennan [2014] EWCA Crim 2387]].
- Diminished responsibility has four elements:
	- D must have an abnormality of mental functioning (s 2(1)), meaning 'state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal’, [[R v Byrne [1960] 2 QB 396]].
	- The abnormality of mental functioning must:
	- Arise from a recognised medical condition (s 2(1)(a)) which can be diagnosed or not at the time of the killing. D must not be acting out of hatred, jealousy or bad temper.
	- Have substantially impaired (meaning ‘more than merely trivial’, [[R v Golds [2016] UKSC 61]]) the defendant's ability (s 2(1)(b)) to understand the nature of D’s conduct, form a rational judgment and/ or exercise self-control, s 2(1A).
- Provide an explanation for D’s conduct (s 2(1)(c)), even if it is not the only cause, s 2(1B) and [[R v Dietschmann [2003] 1 AC 1209]].
- Diminished responsibility is not available for attempted murder, [[R v Campbell [1987] 84 Cr App R 255]].
