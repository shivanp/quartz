# Parties to a crime

## Introduction

Defendants do not always work alone. A conviction for a criminal offence may not necessarily require the accused to do the act that forms the actus reus of the crime.

For example, Fred could break into Ahmed’s house and commit burglary. However Mary could also be liable for the offence if she:

- assisted Fred by driving him to Ahmed’s house or provided a hammer with which to break the window to gain entry;
- encouraged him to carry out the burglary;
- procured the offence by suggesting Fred commit the burglary.

All these modes of participation could make Mary liable for the offence as an accessory.

Alternatively, the parties might take part in a joint enterprise. Fred and Mary may break into Ahmed’s house together. Both enter the house, both intend to steal from the house, and both will be liable for burglary. If, in the course of the break-in, Fred confronts Ahmed and stabs him, killing him, Fred will probably be guilty of murder. Depending on her mens rea, Mary might also be guilty of murder as an accessory.

## Principal Offenders

It is necessary to distinguish between the principal offender and accessories, otherwise referred to as secondary parties.

The principal (P) is the person who, with appropriate mens rea, commits the actus reus of the offence. It is always possible to have more than one principal: if Fred and Mary break into a house together and both have an intention to steal, they will be joint principals for the burglary.

## Innocent Agents

In certain circumstances, a person may be guilty of an offence as a principal, even if another person actually performs the actus reus. This occurs where the person acting can be described as an ‘innocent agent’.

Examples of this include where the person carrying out the actus reus is under the age of criminal liability or is deceived as to what they are doing.

See [[R v Michael (1840) 9 C & P 356]] and [[R v Stringer and Banks (1991) Crim LR 639]]

## Secondary Parties

The [Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 s 8](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/94/section/8) identifies the ways in which someone can be an accessory to a crime. It provides as follows:

> Whosoever shall aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence, whether the same be an offence at common law or by virtue of any Act passed, shall be liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.

The Supreme Court in [[R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8]] stated that the principles governing those who set out on a joint enterprise are the same as for those who aid, abet, counsel or procure. There are therefore five ways in which someone can be liable as an accessory.

1. To aid
2. To abet
3. To counsel
4. To procure
5. To be a party to a joint enterprise.

With the exception of procuring, these actions can be summarised as ‘assisting or encouraging the commission of the principal’s offence’. This was the term used in *R v Jogee*.

```ad-important
title: Accessory liability
_Actus reus_

Any of the following five ways:
- To aid P in committing the offence
- To abet P in committing the offence
- To counsel P in committing the offence
- To procure P to commit the offence
- To be a party to a joint enterprise with P regarding one offence and during the enterprise P commits a second, different offence

_Mens rea_
- An intention to assist or encourage the principal’s conduct.
- If the crime requires a _mens rea_, an intention that the principal will do the _actus reus_ with that _mens rea_. (Procuring would appear to be an exception to this rule.)
- Knowledge of existing facts or circumstances necessary for the offence to be criminal.
```

## Withdrawal

A secondary party may change their mind and want to withdraw their help or encouragement.

The general rule is that it is not enough to just have a change of mind. Something must be done and, at the very least, the withdrawal must be communicated to the principal or a law enforcement agency. Further acts may be required depending on the circumstances of the case.

In [[R v O’Flaherty [2004] Cr App R 20]] Mantell LJ stated:

> ‘[F]or there to be withdrawal, mere repentance does not suffice. To disengage from an incident, a person must do enough to demonstrate that he or she is withdrawing from the joint enterprise. This is ultimately a question of fact and degree for the jury. Account will be taken inter alia of the nature of the assistance and encouragement already given and how imminent the infliction of the fatal injury or injuries is, as well as the nature of the action said to constitute withdrawal.’

Examples:

- [[R v Rook [1993] 2 AL ER 955]] – the minimum required for withdrawal is unequivocal communication of intention to withdraw.
- [[R v Becerra (1975) 62 Cr App R 212]] – depending on the point of time, communication of intention to withdraw could involve stopping the principle attacking the victim.

Where the secondary party has supplied the principal offender with the means of committing the offence, more is required than a simple communication of an intention to withdraw.

### Withdrawal From Spontaneous Violence

In [[R v Mitchell and King [1999] Crim LR 496]] it was suggested in that the test is less onerous for acts of spontaneous violence.

R v Mitchell and King has been strongly criticised on the grounds that if the principal, P, does not know that D has withdrawn, they may still be encouraged to commit the offence by (what they believe is) D’s support. Thus, D will still be abetting.

R v Mitchell and King was confined to its facts by the Court of Appeal in [[R v Robinson [2000] EWCA Crim 8]], where it was pointed out that A, B and D had left the scene and that D’s return was in effect a new attack.

However, the Court of Appeal in [[R v O’Flaherty [2004] Cr App R 20]], not having been referred to R v Robinson, said, obiter, that communication was not necessary for withdrawal from spontaneous violence.

## Conviction of Secondary Party and Acquittal of Principal

Conviction of a secondary party and acquittal of the principal is possible and could occur when the principal has been acquitted due to insufficient evidence or the principal could not be found.

As long as it is clear that someone has committed the offence to which D was a secondary party, D can be convicted.

Another occasion when D can be convicted and the principal acquitted is where the principal has done the actus reus with the mens rea, but has a defence, as in [[R v Bourne (1952) 36 Cr App R 125]]. Bourne procured his wife to do the actus reus with the mens rea of the offence, but she had the defence of marital coercion.

The general rule is that if it cannot be proved which of two people committed the crime, both must be acquitted.

However, if it can be proved that the one who did not commit the crime as the principal was a secondary party to the crime, then both can be convicted ([[R v Russell and Russell [1987] 85 Crim App R 388]]).

### Interaction with Attempt

It is not an offence to attempt to aid, abet, counsel or procure an offence – [s 1(4)(b) Criminal Attempts Act 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/94/section/4).

It is an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure an attempt to commit an offence, [[R v Hui Chi-Ming [1991] 3 All ER 897]].

```ad-summary
This element provides an overview to a variety of parties there can be to a crime: principal offender, accessories and a party to a joint enterprise.
- The principal (P) is the person who, with appropriate mens rea, commits the actus reus of the offence.
- Secondary participation- an accessory (A) aids, abets, counsels, procures the principal offence. Alternatively, A is engaged in a joint enterprise when P commits a second, different offence e.g. P and D commit burglary as principals, P murders the homeowner, D becomes an accessory to P’s murder.

Other key principles regarding accessorial liability covered in this element were:
- Withdrawal- something must be done and communicated to the principal in the case of pre-panned violence (but not necessarily spontaneous violence) or a law enforcement agency.
- Conviction of a secondary party and acquittal of the principal is possible.
- If it can be proved that the person who did not commit the crime as the principal was a secondary party to the crime, then both can be convicted.
- It is not an offence to attempt to aid, abet, counsel or procure an offence.
- It is an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure an attempt to commit an offence.
```

## Secondary Parties

The [Accessories and Abettors Act 1861 s 8](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/94/section/8) identifies the ways in which someone can be an accessory to a crime. It provides as follows:

> Whosoever shall aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of any offence whether the same be an offence at common law or by virtue of any Act passed, shall be liable to be tried, indicted and punished as a principal offender.

The principal (P) is the person who, with appropriate mens rea, commits the actus reus of the offence.

The Supreme Court in [[R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8]] stated that the principles governing those who set out on a joint enterprise are the same as for those who aid, abet, counsel or procure. There are therefore five ways in which someone can be liable as an accessory.

To aid, to abet, to counsel, to procure or to be a party to a joint enterprise.

With the exception of procuring, these actions can be summarised as ‘assisting or encouraging the commission of the principal’s offence’. This was the term used in R v Jogee.

### Actus Reus

In [[Attorney General’s Reference (No 1 of 1975) 2 All ER 684]] Lord Widgery stated:

> ‘We approach s 8 of the 1861 Act on the basis that the words should be given their ordinary meaning, if possible. We approach the section on the basis also that if four words are employed here, 'aid, abet, counsel or procure', the probability is that there is a difference between each of those four words and the other three, because, if there were no such difference, then Parliament would be wasting time in using four words where two or three would do.’

However, despite Lord Widgery’s implication that the words used in the Act are ordinary words, capable of being understood without explanation, some discussion of the terms, and particularly the differences between them, will be of assistance.

### Procuring

In [[Attorney General’s Reference (No 1 of 1975) 2 All ER 684]], it was stated:

> ‘To procure means to produce by endeavour.’

[[Beatty v Gillibanks (1882) 9 QBD 308]]: There must be a causal link between D’s act and the commission of the offence.

Note this is not full factual and legal causation.

### Aiding

This is perhaps the easiest term to understand. It requires the accessory to give help, support or assistance to the principal offender in carrying out the principal offence.

Examples include:

- supplying materials or tools to commit the offence, [[Thambiah v R [1966] AC 37]]
- giving information which helps the principal to commit a crime, [[A-G v Able [1984] QB 795]]
- holding down a victim in assault, [[R v Clarkson [1971] 3 All ER 344]].

There need be no causation in the sense that but for the assistance the crime would not have happened: [[R v Bryce [2004] 2 Cr App R 35]].

There need be no consensus, e.g., if D sees P committing a crime and comes to P’s assistance by, for example, talking to or restraining a police officer who would have prevented P from committing the crime, D is guilty even if D’s assistance is unforeseen and unwanted by and unknown to P.

An accessory before the fact is one who helps before the crime. An accessory before the fact would come under the category of ‘aiding’.

An accessory after the fact has been abolished. Such a person would now be convicted of assisting an offender under [s 4 Criminal Law Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/58/section/4).

### Counselling

This has been held to mean giving advice or encouragement before the commission of the offence.

In [[R v Calhaem [1985] QB 808]] it was held that ‘there is no implication that there should be any causal connection between the counselling and the offence.’ There does not need to be a causal link e.g., but for the counselling, the crime would not be committed.

However, there must be contact between the parties and a connection between the counselling and the offence. The act done must be within the scope of the advice and the principal offender must know of the counselling, i.e., there must be consensus.

> ‘Once encouragement or assistance is proved to have been given, the prosecution does not have to go so far as to prove that it had a positive effect on P’s conduct or on the outcome – [[R v Calhaem [1985] QB 808]]. In many cases, that would be impossible to prove. There might, for example, have been many supporters encouraging [P] so that the encouragement of a single one of them could not be shown to have made a difference. The encouragement might have been ignored, yet the counselled offence committed.’  
> [[R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8]]

### Abetting

This is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as ‘to incite, instigate or encourage’.

Devlin J in [[NCB v Gamble [1959] 1 QB 11]] suggested that it means encouraging **at the time the offence is being committed**. This is in contrast to counselling which is encouraging **before** the commission of the offence.

As with counselling, there need be no causal link and there must be communication. The principal must know they are being abetted.

In [[R v Giannetto [1997] 1 Cr App R 1]] Kennedy LJ considered what kind of encouragement might amount to abetting and concluded:

> ‘Suppose somebody came up to G and said, “I am going to kill your wife”, if he played any part, either in encouragement, as little as patting him on the back, nodding, saying “Oh goody”, that would be sufficient to involve him in the murder to make him guilty, because he is encouraging the murder… Any involvement from mere encouragement upwards would suffice.’

```ad-info
title: Presence at the scene
Mere presence at the scene of the crime is not necessarily enough to count as abetting ([[R v Coney [1882] 8 QBD 534]]).

However, it is possible to abet by mere presence ([[Wilcox v Jeffrey [1951] 1 All ER 464]]).
```

#### Failure to Prevent an Offence

Where D has the right or duty to control the actions of another and deliberately refrains from exercising it, D’s inactivity may be a positive encouragement to the other to perform an illegal act and would therefore be abetting.

| Case                                                   | Relationship to V |

| [[R v J F Alford Transport Ltd [1997] 3 Cr App R 326]] | Employer          |

## Secondary Parties

### Joint Enterprise

A joint enterprise is where two or more people are committing a crime together.

```ad-example
Fred and Mary may break into Ahmed’s house together. Both enter the house, both intend to steal from the house, and both will be liable for burglary. If, in the course of the break-in, Fred confronts Ahmed and stabs him, killing him, Fred will probably be guilty of murder. Depending on her mens rea, Mary might also be guilty of murder as an accessory.
```

The issue of accessorial liability arises when one of the parties goes on to commit a different crime.

Lord Philips described it in [[R v Gnango [2010] EWCA Crim 1691]] as follows: D1 and D2 have a common intention to commit crime A. D1, as an incident of committing crime A, commits crime B.

In a joint enterprise case, at the time of the accessorial offence, the accomplice was committing another offence with the principal. In a simple case of aiding, abetting etc, the accomplice is not committing an offence as a principal.

### Principles

- To be liable under this principle, there is no need to show that D2 aided or encouraged the offence. It is enough that D2 was a party to the joint enterprise and had the relevant mens rea for an accessory.
- The crime B must be committed in the course of or be incidental to crime A. If D1 and D2 got to a house to beat up a man and on the way home together D1 throws a brick through the window of a house, D2 cannot be liable for this criminal damage.
- A party cannot be liable for any offences committed before they join the enterprise.

This was stated by Lord Hughes and Lord Toulson in the Supreme Court as follows:

> ‘The mental element in assisting or encouraging is an intention to assist or encourage the commission of the crime and this requires knowledge of any existing facts necessary for it to be criminal … If the crime requires a particular intent, D2 must intend to assist or encourage D1 to act with such intent.’

This is broken down by Smith, Hogan and Ormerod into 3 parts:

- An intention to assist or encourage the principal’s conduct.
- If the crime requires a mens rea, an intention that the principal will do the actus reus with that mens rea. (Procuring would appear to be an exception to this rule.)
- Knowledge of existing facts or circumstances necessary for the offence to be criminal.

### Intention to Aid or Encourage

This has two elements. D must intend:

1. to do the act which aids or encourages; and
2. it to aid or encourage the commission of the crime.

For example, if D supplies P with a gun which P uses to commit a murder, it must be proved that D intended:

1. to give it to P rather than accidentally leaving it where P could pick it up; and
2. P to use it to cause serious harm to someone.

In [[Lynch v DPP for Northern Ireland [1975] AC 653]] it was held that intention in this context does not mean desire, so there is no need for direct intent. It is enough that D had oblique intent.

D need not have a positive intent that the crime be committed ([[R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8]]). The court gave the example of D who supplies a weapon where, at the time of supplying the weapon, D intends to give P the means to commit a crime, but it remains unclear what P might do. D would be liable even if they have no further interest in whether or not P commits the crime.

Smith, Hogan and Ormerod says this suggests that it is sufficient D intended their act **might** assist in the crime, even if it cannot be said that it definitely will do so. Perhaps the test is as suggested by Herring for conditional intent – that the jury should convict if it decides that D would not mind if the crime were committed. This is suggested by the words ‘D would be liable even if they have no further interest in whether or not P commits the crime.’

### An Intention That P Will Commit the Crime with the Mens Rea

 There are two issues here:

- Conditional intention; and
- Crimes where the mens rea does not correspond to the actus reus.

#### Conditional Intention

It was accepted in Jogee that it is enough that D has a conditional intent that P will commit a crime with the necessary mens rea.

> [!example]  
> If D supplies P with a gun to use in a burglary and intends P to use it to cause serious harm only if disturbed in the burglary, then D intends P to use the gun to cause serious harm.

This is particularly helpful in cases of joint enterprise. If D and P set out on a burglary and D intends that P will use a weapon to cause serious harm to someone if they are disturbed, D will be liable for the serious harm P causes when they are disturbed.

It was made clear in Jogee that to establish conditional intent in such a case more was required than foresight that P might cause serious harm if the condition arose. On the other hand, it cannot be required that D must know P would definitely cause serious harm as per oblique intent. The court gave little guidance on when it is possible to find conditional intent based on foresight, merely saying that conditional intent could be inferred from foresight, but need not be.

Herring suggests that the best guidance for the jury would be to consider **what D’s attitude would be if P did commit the crime**. If D is pleased or accepting of the fact that P acted that way, then the jury should find D has conditional intent the crime would be committed. If D is dismayed that P has committed the crime, then the jury cannot find conditional intention. In cases where P is dismayed, only oblique intention will suffice.

#### Crimes Where the Mens Rea Does Not Correspond to the Actus Reus

It was stated in Jogee that if D1 intends D2 to do serious harm to the victim, D1 will be liable for murder when D2 injures the victim with intent to do serious harm and the victim dies as a result.

This will be despite the fact that D1 could not be said to have intended murder to be committed.

Presumably the same rule applies to s 47 and s 20 Offences Against the Person Act 1861.

### Knowledge of the Facts or Circumstances

If the offence requires goods to be stolen, D needs to know that they are stolen.

If the offence requires lack of consent, D must know that the victim does not consent ([[Johnson v Youden [1950] 1 KB 544]]). Knowledge here includes wilful blindness; a defendant who deliberately shuts their eyes to the obvious will be deemed to have knowledge, [[R v J F Alford Transport Ltd [1997] 3 Cr App R 326]].

D need not know the exact details of the crime which will be committed. D does not need to know the identity of the victim or the day on which the crime will be committed.

In [[R v Bainbridge [1960] 43 Cr App Rep 194]] Lord Parker, quoting with approval from the direction given to the jury by the trial judge, said:

> ‘The knowledge that is required to be proved in the mind of the appellant is not the knowledge of the precise crime. In other words it need not be proved that he knew that the Midland Bank, Stoke Newington branch was going to be broken and entered, and money stolen from that particular bank, but he must know the type of crime that was in fact committed. In this case, it is a breaking and entering of premises and the stealing of property from those premises.’

It is also enough to know that the principal may commit any one of a number of crimes including the crime which the principal does in fact commit, [[DPP for Northern Ireland v Maxwell [1978] 3 All ER 1140]]. This case was approved in Jogee.

### Defendants with a Lesser Intent

Jogee – if a person is party to a violent attack on another, without an intent to assist in the causing of death or really serious harm, but the violence escalates and results in death, that person will be not guilty as an accessory to murder but can be guilty as a principal for the crime of manslaughter.

> [!summary] Accessory liability/ secondary participation  
> The principal (P) is the person who, with appropriate *mens rea*, commits the *actus reus* of the offence. This element considered the *actus reus* and *mens rea* required to be liable as an accessory.
>
> *Actus reus:* any of the following five ways:
> - **To aid P in committing the offence**- giving help, support or assistance before or at the time of the offence e.g. giving information, supplying tools or driving P.
> - **To abet P in committing the offence**- incite, instigate or encourage P at the time of the offence which must be communicated to P. Mere presence at the scene of the crime is not necessarily enough. If D has a right or duty to control the actions of another and refrains from doing so, this can be abetting e.g. parent, employer.
> - **To counsel P in committing the offence**- giving P advice or encouragement before the offence is committed. There must be contact and consensus between P and D along with a connection between the advice and the crime. Causation isn’t needed.
> - **To procure P to commit the offence**- to produce by endeavour. There must be a causal link between D’s act and P’s commission of the offence.
> - **To be a party to a joint enterprise with P regarding one offence and during the enterprise P commits a second, different offence** e.g. P and D commit burglary as principals, P murders the homeowner, D becomes an accessory to P’s murder.
>
> *Mens rea*:
>
> **An intention to assist or encourage the principal’s conduct.** D must intend:
> - to do the act which aids or encourages; and
> - it to aid or encourage the commission of the crime (oblique intent is sufficient, conditional intent may be sufficient).
>
> **If the crime requires a *mens rea*, an intention that the principal will do the *actus reus* with that *mens rea*.**
> - Conditional intention is enough here.
> - D can be liable for greater harm than intended for crimes where the MR does not correspond with the AR e.g. D might intend P do serious harm but if P does serious harm and V dies, D will be liable as an accessory to P’s murder.
>
> **Knowledge of existing facts or circumstances necessary for the offence to be criminal** e.g. if the offence requires lack of consent, D must know that the victim does not consent.
> - A defendant who deliberately shuts their eyes to the obvious has knowledge.
> - D need not know the exact details of the crime which will be committed e.g. V’s identity, the day of the crime or which of a number of crimes D knows P could commit.

## Omerod

To be a principal offender, a person must directly and immediately perform the AR of an offence. A person might also be liable as an accessory, also called a 'secondary party'. Where D is liable as an accessory, he is liable because he aided, abetted, counselled or procured P, who committed the principal offence.

A person D, other than the principal P, might also be liable for an inchoate offence - assisting or encouraging P under the Serious Crime Act 2007 or for conspiring with P that the offence would be committed. There is a crucial difference from secondary liability: D's liability for inchoate offences arises irrespective of whether P has committed the offence.

In secondary liability, D's liability is derivative on the commission of the principal offence: it arises iff the principle offence is committed. So first consider whether the principal offence has been committed, then consider whether D has fulfilled the requirements of aiding and abetting it.

We ask whether D performed the relevant conduct sufficient to constitute assisting or encouraging and did so with the mens rea required for liability as an accessory.

Within the scope of secondary liability there **used to exist at common law** a controversial and misunderstood form of liability known as joint enterprise liability. Following the seminal decision of the Supreme Court in Jogee, that doctrine no longer exists as a separate basis of liability.

So D may be liable:

1. As a principal or joint principal where he has played a part in the commission of the AR of the offence, or where he acts through an innocent agent.
2. As an accessory under s 8 Accessories and Abettors Act 1861, where D has aided, abetted, counselled or procured P in his conduct, where P committed the principal crime.
3. For the commission of a full statutory offence itself if it is defined in terms of assisting or encouraging.

### Accessories and Principals

English law treats principals and individuals who are accessories in identical terms for the purposes of procedure and punishment. It has always been sufficient to show that D was either the principal or accessory.

Supreme Court in [[R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8]] confirmed that 'in some cases the prosecution may not be able to prove whether a defendant was principal or accessory, but it is sufficient to be able to prove that he participated in the crime in one way or another'. This does not render it incompatible with [[ECHR article 6]] on the basis of the requirement that D must know in detail the nature of the case against him ([[R v Mercer [2001] All ER 187]]).

It is still important to distinguish the principal from the accessory:

1. The accessory is only liable once the principal offence has been committed
	1. So if D supplies a gun to P, who shoots V, D is only an accessory to murder once V has died.
	2. Contrasts with inchoate liability, where D would be liable as soon as he supplies the gun
2. Important because in some cases it is only an offence to do something to another and not to assist someone to do it to themselves
3. Accessories must always be proved to have mens rea, even in strict liability offences.
4. Some offences can only be committed by principals (e.g., only a driver can drink-drive)
5. Vicarious liability can be imposed for a principal offender, but not for an accessory
6. Available sentencing differs in exceptional cases.

ss 44-46 SCA 2007 overlap with secondary liability. Where D does an act which is apable of encouraging or assisting, D will be liable under ss 44-46 SCA subject to mens rea, irrespective of whether the anticipated is committed or attempted by P. The offences under these subsections are extremely wide reaching.

To be guilty the secondary party must have knowledge of any facts or circumstances necessary for the principal's conduct to be criminal
