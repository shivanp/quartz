# Mens rea

## Introduction

To establish liability, the prosecution must normally prove that the defendant had a guilty mind, at the time of committing the prohibited act.

Mens rea means ‘guilty mind’. Most offences require that the defendant not only commits the act, but also in some way has a 'guilty mind'. However, this phrase can be quite misleading, as it does not necessarily mean that the defendant is morally guilty, merely that in law the defendant has the required mental element for the crime.

The term '*mens rea*' covers a number of mental states that may need to be proved in relation to the actus reus of a crime. It is possible for a particular actus reus to have more than one type of *mens rea* required in order to complete the offence. Burglary is an example of this.

The state of mind that the prosecution must prove to secure a conviction will vary from crime to crime.

The different types of *mens rea* are summarised:

## Intention

Some offences require that the defendant must have intended a specified result.

The obvious example of this is murder, where the defendant must intend to kill the victim or intend to cause the victim serious harm : [[R v Vickers [1957] 2 QB 664]].

There are two types of intention:

- Direct intention – the **aim or purpose** of the defendant’s act, [[R v Moloney [1985] 1 All ER 1025 (HL)]]; and
- indirect/ oblique intention – used in rare cases where the defendant does something manifestly dangerous and someone dies or is seriously injured, but that was not the primary aim of the defendant.

See [[Intention]].

## Recklessness

Recklessness occurs when somebody takes an unjustifiable risk, aware of the danger that the prohibited harm may occur upon taking that risk.

More often, the defendant can be convicted, either if D intended the result, or if D was reckless as to whether the result should occur. This is a position, for example, with the offence of criminal damage.

Some offences use other words when defining the *mens rea* needed, such as the word 'maliciously'. This has been held to allow for the actus reus to be committed intentionally or in the alternative, recklessly such as the Offences [Against the Person Act 1861, s 20](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/20).

See [[Recklessness]].

## Knowledge and Belief

Under the [Theft Act 1968, s 22](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/22), a person is guilty of handling stolen goods if, 'knowing or believing them to be stolen’, that person receives the goods.

These words have been held to allow for the defendant who is absolutely certain as to the existence of a particular circumstance, or is at least possibly aware that the particular circumstance exists.

## Dishonesty

In common with most offences under the Theft Act 1968, the defendant must also be found to have been dishonest when handling the goods. This word is not actually defined in the Act.

However, the Supreme Court considered this requirement in the case of [[Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67]], and a workable test was set out.

## Negligence

Negligence is when the defendant’s actions fall below the standard of a reasonable person.

Although negligence is of great importance in civil law, it does not feature prominently in the criminal law. There are a number of statutory offences in which negligence is the basis of liability, and perhaps the best known of these is careless driving. Some criminal law offences have negligence as an element of *mens rea*, gross negligence manslaughter for example. Here, the negligence must be gross.

In [[R v Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 (CCA)]] the distinction between gross negligence and civil negligence was described:

> '… in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime against the state and conduct deserving punishment.'

There is some opinion that negligence should not feature at all, as it requires judging a person against the state of mind of a non-existent, hypothetical person rather than their own state of mind, which is surely what *mens rea* requires. Lord Diplock in [[R v Sheppard [1981] AC 394 (HL)]]:

> 'The concept of the reasonable man as providing the standard by which the liability of real persons for their conduct is to be determined is a concept of civil law, particularly in relation to the tort of negligence; the obtrusion into criminal law of conformity with the notional conduct of the reasonable man as relevant to criminal liability, though not unknown, is exceptional, and should not be lightly extended.'

## Summary

It is important to remember that any discussion concerning whether a defendant has a particular form of *mens rea* must, in practice, be linked to a specific act or consequence as required for the offence in question (i.e. the *actus reus*). It is never acceptable to simply state *mens rea* in the abstract. For example, to be convicted of committing criminal damage, the defendant must either intend to destroy/damage property belong to another, or be reckless as to the destruction/damage of the property belonging to another.

```ad-example
The Theft Act 1968, s 1 provides:

'A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.'

The _mens rea_ of the offence of theft is -   dishonestly, intention of permanently depriving.
```

```ad-example
The Criminal Damage Act 1971, s 1(1) states:

'A person who without lawful excuse destroys or damages any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.'

The _mens rea_ of the offence of basic criminal damage is - intending or being reckless as to destroying or damaging property belonging to another
