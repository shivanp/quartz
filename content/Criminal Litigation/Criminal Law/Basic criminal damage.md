# Basic criminal damage

## Basic Offence

```ad-statute
title: [s 1(1) Criminal Damage Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/1)

'A person who without lawful excuse damages or destroys any property belonging to another intending to destroy or damage any such property or being reckless as to whether any such property would be destroyed or damaged shall be guilty of an offence.'
```

The maximum sentence is ten years' imprisonment.

The offence of basic criminal damage offence may be broken down into five parts:

- Destroy or damage
- Property
- Belonging to another
- Without lawful excuse
- Intention or recklessness as to the damage or destruction of property belonging to another

### *Actus reus*: Destroy or Damage

The CDA 1971 does not provide a definition of the terms 'damage' or 'destroy’.

The term ‘destroy’ means that following D’s actions, the property ceases to exist. However, much of the case law has concerned itself with the definition of damage.

Whether property is damaged is a question of fact and degree:

In [[Samuels v Stubbs [1972] 4 SASR 200]], the court considered that it was difficult to lay down a general rule as to what constitutes damage. It held that it must be guided by the circumstances of each case, the nature of the article, and the mode by which it was affected. The court stated:

> '[T]he word … is sufficiently wide in its meaning to embrace injury, mischief or harm done to property, and that in order to constitute damage it is unnecessary to establish such definite or actual damage as renders the property useless or prevents it from serving its normal function …'

- Damage need not be permanent. It is relevant that time, effort and money is spent in restoring the property- [[Hardman v Chief Constable of Avon [1986] Crim LR 330]]
- [[Roe v Kingerlee [1986] Crim LR 735]]: if there is a cost to fix the damage, points towards damage caused.
- [[A (a juvenile) v R [1978] Crim LR 689]]: no cost, no criminal damage.

In [[Morphitis v Salmon [1990] Crim LR 48]], the court stated:

> '[Criminal damage includes] not only permanent or temporary physical harm but also permanent or temporary impairment of value or usefulness.'

[[R v Fiak [2005] EWCA Crim 2381]]: rendering objects temporarily unusable can constitute damage.

### Property

```ad-statute
title: [s 10(1) CDA 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/10)

‘In this Act “property” means property of a tangible nature, whether real or personal, including money and-

(a) including wild creatures which have been tamed or are ordinarily kept in captivity, and any other wild creatures or their carcasses if, but only if, they have been reduced into possession which has not been lost or abandoned or are in the course of being reduced into possession; but

(b) not including mushrooms growing wild on any land or flowers, fruit or foliage of a plant growing wild on any land.

For the purposes of this subsection “mushroom” includes any fungus and “plant” includes any shrub or tree.’
```

In [[R v Whitely (1991) 93 Cr App R 25]], the court held that information does not fall within the definition of 'property' contained in the CDA 1971, s 10(1).

### Belonging to Another

```ad-statute
title: [s 10(2) CDA 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/10)

‘Property shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as belonging to any person—

(a) having the custody or control of it;

(b) having in it any proprietary right or interest (not being an equitable interest arising only from an agreement to transfer or grant an interest); or

(c) having a charge on it.’
```

It can be seen that property can belong to more than one person. Where D owns property, it can still belong to another, such as a co-owner. If the property is mortgaged, it will also belong to the bank or mortgage company by virtue of s 10(2)(c).

### *Mens rea*

The *mens rea* for basic criminal damage is the intention or recklessness as to the destruction or damage to property belonging to another.

Intention is to be given its ordinary meaning, [[R v Moloney [1985] 1 All ER 1025 (HL)]], and therefore requires consideration of whether, at the time D carried out the actus reus, it was D’s aim or purpose to destroy or damage the property belonging to another.

In [[R v G and another [2003] UKHL 50]], the House of Lords stated that to convict a person of reckless criminal damage, the prosecution must prove that:

1. at the time of committing the *actus reus*, the accused was **subjectively** aware of a risk; and
2. in the circumstances known to the accused, it was **objectively** unreasonable for the accused to take that risk.

It has been confirmed that the *mens rea* extends to the whole of the actus reus.

```ad-tip
The Court of Appeal held that it is insufficient that D does an act that damages property intentionally. What must also be proved is that D knew, or was reckless as to whether, the property belonged to another.
```

While ignorance of the criminal law is no defence, ignorance of the civil law can prevent liability ([[R v Smith [1974] QB 354]]).

## Basic Arson

Arson is criminal damage by fire, however slight. Basic arson is charged under s 1(1) and s 1(3) CDA 1971.

| Element    | Arson                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Actus reus | Destroy or damage by fire property belonging to another without lawful excuse. |
| Mens rea   | Intention or recklessness as to the destruction or damage of property belonging to another by fire.                                                                               |

```ad-statute
title: [s 1(3) CDA 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/1)

‘Any offence committed under this section by destroying or damaging property by fire shall be charged as arson.’
```

## Lawful Excuse

A defendant will not commit criminal damage if they have a lawful excuse. As will be seen a lawful excuse can be:

- Any general defencewhere relevant, can apply to any offence of criminal damage/ arson under [s 5(5) CDA 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/5); or
- [s 5(2) CDA 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/5) lawful excuse defences – where relevant, can apply to basic criminal damage or basic arson (but not the aggravated form of these offences).

### S 5(2) Defences

There are two lawful excuse defences in section 5(2) CDA 1971:

| Section   | Defence                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s 5(2)(a) | operates where the defendant believes that the owner would have consented to the damage. |
| s 5(2)(b) | operates where the defendant acts to protect their or another’s property.                                                                                         |

### S 5(2)(a)

This defence is dealt with in the CDA 1971, s 5(2)(a) and (3):

- s 5(2)(a) operates where the defendant believes that the owner would have consented to the damage; and
- s 5(3) says that the defendant's belief need not be reasonable. It is only necessary for it to be honestly held.

```ad-statute
title: [s 5 CDA 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/5)

(2) ‘A person charged with an offence to which this section applies, shall, whether or not he would be treated for the purposes of this Act as having a lawful excuse apart from this subsection, be treated for those purposes as having a lawful excuse-

- (a) if at the time of the act or acts alleged to constitute the offence he believed that the person or persons whom he believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction of or damage to the property in question had so consented, or would have so consented to it if he or they had known of the destruction or damage and its circumstances; or

- (b) if he destroyed or damaged or threatened to destroy or damage the property in question or, in the case of a charge of an offence under section 3 above, intended to use or cause or permit the use of something to destroy or damage it, in order to protect property belonging to himself or another or a right or interest in property which was or which he believed to be vested in himself or another, and at the time of the act or acts alleged to constitute the offence he believed-
	- (a) that the property, right or interest was in immediate need of protection; and
	- (b) that the means of protection adopted or prosed to be adopted were or would be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.

(3) For the purposes of this section it is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not if it is honestly held.’
```

#### Mistaken Belief Due to Voluntary Intoxication

Key case: [[Jaggard v Dickinson [1980] Crim LR 717 (QBD)]]. The test is subjective, so voluntary intoxication does not exclude the defence from standing.

#### Defendant's Motive

Provided the defendant honestly believes that the owner of the property has or would have consented to the damage to property, the defendant's motive for causing the damage is irrelevant to the CDA 1971, s(5)(2)(a), even where the motive is to perpetrate a fraud. Criminal damage is not an offence of dishonesty ([[R v Denton [1982] 1 All ER 65]]).

#### Limits on Defence

[[Blake v DPP [1993] Crime LR 586]] – can't say God had given consent as an excuse.

### S 5(2)(b)

The CDA 1971, s 5(2)(b) operates where the defendant acts to protect their or another's property. The section relates only to the protection of property, as opposed to the protection of people ([[R v Baker & Wilkins [1997] Crim LR 497]]).

#### Acts to Protect Property

There are four requirements for the section 5(2)(b) defence aspects of which we will consider in greater depth:

1. [[R v Baker & Wilkins [1997] Crim LR 497]] – The defendant must act to protect property.
2. Section 5(2)(b)(i)- The defendant must believe that the property was in immediate need of protection (subjective test, see s 5(3)). See [[Johnson v DPP [1994] Crim LR 673]]
3. Section 5(2)(b)(ii)- The defendant must believe that the means of protection adopted are reasonable (subjective test, see s 5(3)).
4. [[R v Hunt [1977] Crim LR 740]]- The damage caused by the defendant must be (objectively) capable of protecting the property.
	1. Arguably, the introduction of this objective test, is inconsistent with the language used in the CDA 1971, s 5(2)(b) which indicates a subjective test, see s 5(3).
	2. This protection must not be too remote: [[R v Hill and Hall (1998) 89 Cr App R 74]]

The CDA 1971, s 5(5) preserves the availability of the general defences to criminal offences such as self-defence, and duress

> ‘This section shall not be construed as casting doubt on any defence recognised by law as a defence to criminal charges.’
