Robbery is an aggravated form of theft, and the wording of the [s 8 TA 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/8) tells us we must establish that the accused has stolen. A conviction for robbery will only follow if all the elements of theft as defined in the [TA 1968, s 1(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/1) are satisfied.

> If there is no theft, there is no robbery. You should consider whether the full offence of theft is satisfied first before moving onto whether it becomes a robbery. See [[R v Robinson [1977] Crim LR 173]].

## Actus Reus

### Force or Threat of Force

There are three ways in which this element can be satisfied, if the defendant:

- Uses force; or
- puts a person in fear of being then and there subjected to force; or
- seeks to put a person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.

This is the aggravating element which elevates a theft to a robbery.

Force is not defined in the TA 1968, and it is a matter of fact for the jury whether the defendant's actions amount to force. It is however clear that 'force' does not require violence ([[R v Dawson and James (1977) 64 Cr App R 170, CA]]).

### Force Applied Through Property

- Force used against property must cause force against the person to satisfy this element of the actus reus ([[R v Clouden [1987] Crim LR 56]]).
- If there is no direct contact, and only minimal indirect contact, this will not be considered force ([[P v DPP [2012] EWHC 1657 (Admin)]]).

### Puts a Person in Fear

There is no need to apply physical force against a person to satisfy this element. A threat by the defendant which causes the person to think that force will be used against them or at the very least apprehend that fact, will be enough.

This was confirmed by the Divisional Court in [[R v DPP [2007] EWHC 739 (Admin)]], where it was held that there is no need for the victim to fear the force they think will be used against them. This makes sense, otherwise defendants could avoid liability if they happen to threaten a particularly brave person.

The defendant can still be liable, even if the person is not aware that they are being threatened with force, provided the defendant intends to make that person think they will be subjected, then and there, to force.

This legal principle is illustrated by the case of [[R v Taylor [1996] 10 Archbold News 2 (CA)]].

### On Any Person

This element confirms that the threat or use of force does not have to be directed towards the person from whom the property is stolen. The threat or use of force can be ‘on any person’.

### Force Immediately Before or at the Time of Stealing

There is usually no problem in determining whether this requirement is satisfied.

Difficulties will arise, however, if the threat or use of force occurs after the theft has technically been committed.

This was considered in the case of [[R v Hale (1979) 68 Cr App R 415]] and the issue was dealt with by treating the appropriation as a continuous act.

## Mens Rea

The defendant must:

- act with the mens rea of theft; and
- intend to use force in order to steal.

The continuing act theory from R v Hale might be useful here, for example in cases where the defendant has started stealing before force is used.

[[R v Vinall [2011] EWCA 2652]] highlights that force must be used at the time of theft, rather than stealing as an afterthought to the force.

## Omerod

In Clouden, D's conviction for robbery was upheld, where he wrenched a shopping basket from V's hand and ran off with it. This illustrates the ambiguity over the true foundation of robbery: it is a hybrid offence protecting property and personal safety, and the courts refuse to narrow it down by defining its concepts in an unduly technical fashion.

In Hale, D and E entered V's house and while D was upstairs stealing a jewellery box, E was downstairs tying up V. Their convictions for robbery were upheld, although the appropriation of the jewellery box might have been completed before the force was used. The court regarded appropriation as a continuing act. The matter needs to be looked at in a common-sense way; while the force must be used at the time of the theft and in order to steal, the theft needs to be looked at in its entirety.

The need for the court to adopt a pragmatic approach is even greater following the extension of the concept of appropriation in Hicks.

Force converts theft into robbery only when its use or threat is in a real sense directly part of the theft and is used in order to accomplish the theft.
