| Component  | Aggravated criminal damage/ arson               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Actus reus | Destroy or damage (by fire), property (s 10(1)) |
| Mens rea   | Intention or recklessness as to the damage or destruction of property (by fire) - s 1(2)(a). Intention or recklessness as to the endangerment of life by the damage or destruction (by fire) - s 1(2)(b)                                             |

### Notes

- A defendant can commit aggravated criminal damage to their own property.
- The lawful excuse defences in the [CDA 1971, s 5(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/5) do not apply. However, a defendant might nevertheless have a lawful excuse if any of the general defences to criminal offences apply, s 5(5).
- As a matter of actus reus, it is irrelevant whether the life of another was actually endangered ([[R v Sangha [1988] 2 All ER 385]], [[R v Dudley [1989] Crim LR 57 (CA)]]).
- The danger to life must arise from the damaged property ([[R v Steer [1988] 1 AC 111 (HL)]], [[R v Webster [1995] 2 All ER 168]]).
