# Aggravated burglary

## Statute

```ad-statute
title: [s 10 Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/10)

(1) A person is guilty of aggravated burglary if he commits any burglary and at the time has with him any firearm or imitation firearm, any weapon of offence, or any explosive; and for this purpose –

(a) ‘firearm’ includes an airgun or airpistol, and ‘imitation firearm’ means anything which has the appearance of being a firearm, whether capable of being discharged or not; and

(b) ‘weapon of offence’ means any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to or incapacitating a person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use; and

(c) ‘explosive’ means any article manufactured for the purpose of producing a practical effect by explosion, or intended by the person having it with him for that purpose.

(2) A person guilty of aggravated burglary shall on conviction on indictment be liable to imprisonment for life.
```

## Purpose

Consider the maximum sentences set out in the statute for burglary and aggravated burglary.

- The maximum sentence for burglary is set out in [s 9(3) Theft Act 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/9) as:
- 14 years - where the building or part of a building was a dwelling; or
- 10 years - in any other case.
- The maximum sentence for aggravated burglary is set out in [s 10(2) TA 1968](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/10) as life imprisonment.

Burglary when in possession of a firearm, weapon of offence or explosive is deemed so serious to warrant a maximum of life imprisonment. The reason given by the Criminal Law Revision Committee at the time for this maximum sentence is that aggravated burglary could be very frightening to anyone in the building and could potentially lead to fatal consequences.

### Weapon of Offence

If you break down the wording of section 10(1)(b) a ‘weapon of offence’ can be any article:

- Made or adapted for causing injury to or incapacitating a person; or
- Which, at the time of committing the burglary, the defendant possesses with the intention of causing injury to or incapacitating a person.

See

- [[R v Stones [1989] 89 Cr App R 26]]
- [[R v Kelly [1993] 97 Cr App R 245]]

### When Must D Have Article with Them

It is important to establish that the defendant has the offending article with them at the time they commit the relevant burglary, be it a s 9(1)(a) burglary (at the point of entry) or s 9(1)(b) burglary (on commission or attempted commission of theft or grievous bodily harm). This was confirmed in the following cases.

- [[R v O'Leary [1986] 82 Cr App R 341]]
- [[R v Francis [1982] Crim LR 363]]
- [[R v Klass [1998] 1 Cr App R 453]]
