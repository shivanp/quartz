# Investigating the Target

## Buyer's Objectives

A buyer will not want to enter into a binding commitment to acquire the garget unless it has as much information as possible. *Caveat emptor* means the buyer will try to acquire as much information as possible, but will also negotiate lots of warranties and indemnities into the SPA.

Civil law counties implement a principle of buyer protection; statutory protections for a buyer in corporate acquisitions. Also the duty to negotiate in good faith includes a duty to inform. Significant at all stages, including due diligence.

In Germany, the seller has disclosure obligations towards a buyer to disclose certain material facts. Under French law, failure to disclose material facts could amount to deceit. So there is often far less due diligence in such countries.

## Types

### Business Advisers

Commercial assessment undertaken by the buyer/ professional business advisers.

### Accountants

- Buyer may instruct a firm of accountants to investigate the target and produce a report.
- Accountant report plays a role in framing the acquisition report, particularly warranties and indemnities
- Firm of accountants formally instructed by a letter of engagement.
- Report should cover:
	- Commercial activities of target
		- Details of past, present and planned activities
		- Market in which target operates
		- Pricing policy, terms of trade, supplier arrangements, customers, agents.
	- Management structure and employees
		- Directors and senior management details
		- Directors and senior management service contracts
		- Number of other employees
		- Training and recruitment.
	- Taxation
		- Target's current tax position
		- Effect of acquisition on tax affairs of target and buyer
		- Likely future tax position
		- Warranties and indemnities to obtain.
	- Profitability
		- Audited results for past few years.
	- Balance sheet strength
		- Borrowing commitments
		- Capital expenditure, capital commitments, long-term contracts, liabilities
		- Debtors and bad debts.
	- Accounting systems and policies
	- Premises
		- Location, use and tenure of each property.

Buyer may use the report as a lever for lowering the acquisition price. Practice on allowing the seller to have a copy of the report is variable. Sometimes the disclosure letter may deem matters referred to in the accountants' report to have been disclosed by the seller, and the buyer may insist on a warranty as to the accuracy of its contents.

Under English law, the buyer will have claims against the reporting accountants if the report is negligently prepared (both in contract for breach of the implied duty of reasonable skill and care, and in tort for negligent misstatement).

### Legal Advisers

Legal due diligence is usually undertaken by the buyer's legal advisers. Generally focuses on the constitutional framework of the target, terms on which the target does business, ownership of assets and restrictions, and the extent of potential liabilities.

The process may, however, be limited by legal restrictions on the disclosure of information. For example, the management of a German GmbH cannot release certain corporate information without prior shareholder approval.

#### International Team

- Might need a due diligence coordinator.
- Conflicts of interest: general practice to apply the conflict rules of the jurisdiction in which the work is done.
- Fees may vary: success/ contingency fees prohibited in many jurisdictions, some fees fixed.

## Scope of Legal Due Diligence

- Commercial aims
	- If the buyer is already familiar with the target, extensive due diligence less important.
	- Is the acquisition for expansion of a business or for investment?
- Consider risks in the market.
- Types of transaction
	- Acquisition of share capital likely to involve more extensive due diligence.
	- Buyer of assets does not generally assume the liabilities of the business. Buyer will direct investigation at specified assets and liabilities to be acquired.
- Seller may not be able/ prepared to give much contractual protection to the buyer
	- Insolvency practitioner will only give very limited contractual reassurances.
	- If the buyer can get lots of contractual protections, may not bother with very extensive due diligence.
- Practical limitations
	- Time constraints.
	- Financial resources and manpower
	- Confidentiality
		- Seller may want to keep the proposed sale a secret from its own workforce.
		- May be reluctant to hand over commercially sensitive information.
		- Consent of 3rd parties may be needed to view some information.
		- Seller must take care not to breach its own confidentiality obligations.

## Undertaking Investigation

- Public searches
	- Companies House records
	- HM Land Registry property records
	- Registered IP rights
	- Trade press, commercial information.
- Questionnaire
	- Due diligence questionnaire forwarded to the buyer.
	- Should be tailored to the business.
- Data room
	- The seller and its legal advisers make information about the target available to the buyer.
	- Aims to protect commercially sensitive material
	- Agree a list of people who can access the data room
	- Documents provided in read-only format.

## Areas of Investigation

### Corporate Information

- Companies House search, and similar in other jurisdictions.
- The obligation to file information at Companies House is placed on the company itself, and although the company and its officers are liable to fines on default, there is no provision for compensating a third party who suffers loss as a result of this information being incomplete or inaccurate.
- Information on Companies House may be out of date.

#### Constitutional Documents

- Check the company has the power to carry on the business and discuss steps to be taken at completion.
- Check articles for any restriction on share transfer.

#### Directors and Shareholders

- Starting point: confirmation statement sent by the company to the Registrar of Companies.
- Ask the company if anything has changed since this last return.
- Check if the directors hold any other directorships.

#### Internal Registers and Minutes

- Check allotments and transfers of shares have been carried out in accordance with statute and the articles.
- Subject to confidentiality, can likely view any board minutes.

### Financial Information

- Study accounts, regardless of whether a full accountants' report is commissioned.
- Work with the accountants to consider what warranties or indemnities should be included.
- IFRS has removed some of the differences in availability, content and presentation of financial information between European countries. Still differences in what accounts reflect a “true and fair view” judgment of company accounts.
- US companies use US GAAP.

#### Loans

- On an asset acquisition, check whether any assets are subject to a charge.
- On a share acquisition, request copies of all loan documentation. Check whether any loans are repayable on demand or entitle the lender to remand immediate repayment of the balance of the loan on a change of control.
- Has the seller guaranteed any obligations of the target? Buyer may be asked to procure the release of the seller from such guarantees and indemnify the seller if release is not obtained on completion.
- If group companies have guaranteed each others obligations, buyer will insist such obligations do not continue after completion.

#### Charges

- Check Charges Register at Companies House. Information on record may not be accurate or up to date (21 days from creation to register).
- If charges have not been registered, the loan becomes repayable immediately.
- Buyer may acquire a credit report.

#### Check Solvency

- Bankruptcy search at the Land Charges Department should be carried out against individual sellers of shares or of a business immediately before completion.
- Companies House search to check for corporate insolvency.
- Also ring the Central Registry of winding-up petitions.

### Key Contracts

- Share acquisition: lack of disruption with target's trade.
- Buyer will require full details and copies of all significant contracts into which the target has entered.
- On an asset sale, examine those considered vital to the business and check if they require consent to assignment/ restrictions on assignment.
- Share sale: check for any change of control clauses.
- Check expiry of contracts and whether they can be terminated on short notice.
- Check for proper execution of contracts.

#### Change of Control

- Often found in employment contracts (e.g., golden parachute clauses).
- Non-arm's length trading relationships
	- Sellers of the target may have been supplying goods or services to the target directly or through other companies in which they have an interest.
	- Where the target is a member of a group, ask for information on all goods and services supplied to/ from other members of the group.
	- May need to implement a transitional arrangement where the seller agrees to provide certain support services for a defined period.

#### IP Rights

- Ask for full details
- Carry out searches of UK IP office to establish that the target's IP rights are valid and do not infringe on IP rights owned by others.
- IP rights may have been registered in the name of a founder - check what the target actually owns.
- Transfer any IP rights to the target/ seller by (1) an assignment of the rights to the target, and (2) recording of such assignment in IP registers.
- If assignment of a right is not recorded within 6 months, only beneficial title to the right is transferred, not the legal right.

### Employees and Pensions

- The rights and obligations of employees working in a business which is acquired will usually transfer automatically to the buyer (TUPE 2006).
- Review service contracts of current employees, especially if changes are to be made.
- In the US, in the absence of an express written agreement or binding oral agreement, an employee's contract can be terminated without notice and without cause at any time.

#### Collective Arrangements

e.g., trade union recognition, workplace agreements. France and Germany have very strict rules about notification to employees of any proposed transfer.

#### Retaining Managers and Directors

Negotiate as early as possible (subject to confidentiality considerations).

#### Restrictive Covenants

- Check whether the service contracts of the target's personnel contain effective restraints on their activities after termination.
- Typical clauses: not to work in a competing business, not to solicitor or entice away customers.
- English law: valid and enforceable only if to protect a legitimate trade interest of the employer, are not against the public interest and are reasonable between the parties ([[in Tillman v Egon Zehnder [2019] UKSC 32]]).
- Non-solicitation clause should be limited to customers who have recently dealt with the target.
- Non-competition clause should be limited in duration and geographic area.
- Clauses preventing the disclosure of information after termination can only be effective in relation to highly confidential information or trade secrets ([[Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler [1986] IRLR 69, CA]]).
- If any of the directors who are leaving are also selling shares in the target, the buyer should ensure that they agree to restrictive covenants in the sale and purchase agreement (more likely to be upheld than provisions in the SPA).
- Restrictive covenants which are prima facie valid will not survive a repudiatory breach of contract by the employer. There is a danger that if the target dismisses employees in breach of contract, this may discharge former employees from compliance with restrictive covenants ([[General Billposting Co Ltd v Atkinson [1909] AC 118, HL]]).

#### Pensions

- Target must satisfy obligations to enrol workers in a pension scheme and make contributions on their behalf, under auto-enrolment regime.
- Buyer's lawyers will require full details of any pension scheme.
- Check the type of pension scheme: final salary scheme (members guaranteed a particular level of benefit on retirement) or money purchase scheme (benefit dependent on return on fund)
- Is pension scheme stand-alone or part of a larger scheme involving other employees
- US: defined contribution vs defined benefit schemes. V similar to the UK version.

### Property

- May prove impractical to carry out full structural surveys etc. 2 means of protection for the buyer:
	- Certificate of title given by seller's solicitor – chiefly that the properties have good and marketable title. Law Society standard form certificate, generally accepted in commercial transactions. If a false statement/ omission in the certificate is the result of incorrect information supplied by the client, the buyer will have no recourse against the seller's solicitor and will need to rely on a warranty against the seller.
	- Warranties in the SPA: usually sought by the buyer (e.g., that the properties are in good repair).
- Inspection/ valuation – physical inspection of properties important to the target is advisable. For leaseholds, check whether the repairing obligations under the lease have been complied with.

#### Landlord Consents

- Frequently required for the assignment of any leaseholder premises included in the sale.
- Buyer's lawyers should check whether the seller has guaranteed lease obligations.
- Seller likely to ask for an undertaking from the buyer that the buyer uses best endeavours to obtain the release of the seller from guarantees and to indemnify the seller against any liability.
- Talk to landlord (subject to confidentiality).

#### UK Leases Pre-1996

- Original tenant of leasehold remained liable to the landlord for breaches of the terms of the lease even after assignment.
- On an asset sale, the seller may, therefore, have a contingent liability after completing the assignment to the buyer of leasehold premises of which it was the original tenant. On a share sale, the buyer’s lawyers should ask whether the target company has been granted a lease at any time.
- Investigation of share purchase
- Buyer of shares will not obtain protection from searches of official registers in the same way as a buyer of business assets - since protection is afforded to a buyer of an interest in the land, whereas on a share acquisition there is no change in ownership.
- Does not have the benefit of any priority period in which to complete the acquisition without further matters appearing on the register.
- Not entitled to receive compensation from a local authority which fails to register a local land charge (Local Land Charges Act 1975).

### Environmental Matters

- Share acquisition: buyer directly liable for past actions of the company, since it is taking over the identity of the target.
- The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1154), as amended by the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/110), require an environmental permit to be obtained by any person operating a regulated facility.
- Permit often issued subject to certain conditions

#### Penalties

Breach of various provisions of the environmental legislation, such as operating a regulated facility without an environmental permit, will give rise to criminal liability. Clean-up costs and any damages resulting from civil liability can prove to be extremely substantial.

#### Public Information

Information on environmental matters available to the public through registers compiled and maintained by the regulator.

#### Transfer of Environmental Permits

- Ask the seller for copies of all relevant environmental permits.
- Check they are in force and cover all relevant operations.
- Transfer of an environmental permit to a new operator is only possible if the regulator is satisfied the transferee is competent to operate the regulated facility in accordance with the terms of the permit.

Other searches may also be done, e.g., site visits, desktop survey, environmental audit.

#### Bribery Act 2010 and Modern Slavery Act 2015

The Bribery Act 2010 (BA 2010) came into force on 1 July 2011 and is enforced chiefly by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The Act creates four offences – broadly, those of offering a bribe, accepting a bribe, bribing a foreign public official and, for commercial organisations, failing to prevent bribery. All transactions are covered.

Breach of the BA 2010 carries stiff criminal penalties – for individuals, up to 10 years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine, and unlimited fines for companies. Obtain warranty protection from the seller in the usual way. Particularly important since the bribery is unlikely to be glaringly obvious.

Any organisation which has a turnover of £36 million or more is obliged to publish a transparency statement under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The statement must confirm either the steps the company has taken during the previous financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in its supply chain, or that the company has taken no such steps.

## Due Diligence Reports

In large transactions, legal advisers may be expected to produce a legal due diligence report. Information revealed in the report will be used in negotiation of the acquisition documentation and warranties/ indemnities required by buyer.

- Interim reports may be produced for the buyer summarising areas of importance
- A full audit is rare because very expensive to produce.
- The usual form of report is “by exception”. Focuses on matters material to the proposed acquisition, or those which are unusual/ unexpected.

### Format of Report

An executive summary should set out the key findings of the report. May include key proposals to be fulfilled before the acquisition can proceed. The buyer will have claims against legal advisers if the report is negligently prepared.

The buyer of shares or assets may have relied on statements, forecasts and opinions by parties other than the seller. Remedy against third parties available if the information is false or misleading.

#### Caparo

[[Caparo Industries v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 (HL)]].

Caparo, which was a shareholder in Fidelity plc, acquired control of the company relying on the audited accounts. Caparo claimed that the accounts were inaccurate and misleading in showing a pre-tax profit, when in fact the company had made a loss. It sued the company’s auditors for negligence in auditing the accounts (and certifying them as ‘true and accurate’). Caparo alleged that the auditors owed it a duty of care either as a potential investor, or as an existing shareholder. The Court of Appeal held that the auditors owed Caparo a duty of care as a shareholder but not as a potential investor.

The House of Lords emphasised that the imposition of a duty of care in economic loss cases required ‘proximity’ of relationship as well as foreseeability of loss (a third criterion being that it must not be unreasonable to impose a duty of care). In determining the question of proximity, there was no single general principle, and the court should be guided by established categories of negligence. A review of previous cases in this area led the House of Lords to identify three conditions for proximity to exist. It must be shown that the maker of the statement knew the following:

1. that the statement would be communicated to the person relying on it or to a clearly defined class of person to whom that person belonged; and
2. this would be done specifically in connection with a particular transaction or a particular type of transaction; and
3. the person would be very likely to rely on it in deciding whether to enter into the transaction.

#### Morgan Crucible

[[Morgan Crucible plc v Hill Samuel and Co Ltd [1991] 2 WLR 665]].

Following a takeover bid for a listed company by the plaintiffs (claimants), the chairman of the listed company incorporated various statements and profit forecasts in documents issued to shareholders and to the press as a defence to the bid. The plaintiffs increased their bid and successfully acquired control of the company. Some of the financial statements and forecasts were misleading, and the company was not as valuable as this information had led the plaintiffs to believe. They sued the chairman, the auditors and the merchant bank advising the board in negligence.

 On an application to amend the statement of claim after the decision in Caparo (the original claim had also been based on financial statements made prior to the bid and the plaintiffs wished to restrict it to statements, etc made after the bid), the Court of Appeal granted leave on the grounds that the amended claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. The Court was of the view that it was arguable that there was a sufficient degree of proximity since the defendants intended the plaintiffs to rely on the representations in deciding whether to make an increased bid. (The case settled before reaching trial.)

### Main Report

The main report is usually divided into sections covering each area of the target business. Each issue investigated is identified, together with the results of that investigation and any possible impact there may be for the proposed acquisition.
