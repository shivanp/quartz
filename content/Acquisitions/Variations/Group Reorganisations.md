# Group Reorganisations

## Group Companies

Groups of companies are popular:

- Each company has a separate legal personality and limited liability
- Risky businesses packaged into separate subsidiaries.

Groups can come about in various ways:

- Enterprise formed as a group
- Splitting up a large concern (hiving down)
- M&A

In company law, each company within the group is treated as a separate entity with its own assets and liabilities.

### Extension of Restrictions to Group Companies

- Membership of holding company prohibited
	- s 136 CA 2006 prohibits a subsidiary/ nominee from being a member of its holding company and renders any transfer/ issue of holding company shares to a subsidiary/ nominee void, except where the subsidiary is acting as a trustee or as an authorised dealer in securities.
- SPTs prohibited
	- Section 190 of the CA 2006 requires the passing of an ordinary resolution of the members of a company where a director of the company or its holding company acquires an asset from the company or disposes of an asset to the company which is ‘substantial’.
	- If the director is a director of its holding company, an ordinary resolution of the holding company is also necessary to approve the transaction.
	- No approval is required under s 190, however, by any company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary (s 190(4)(b)).
	- See workshop 9 for an example.
- Loans to directors
	- s 197 CA 2006: shareholder approval is required for a company to make loans to its directors
	- If a loan is to be made to a director of the company’s holding company, the approval of the members of the holding company must also be sought.

```ad-statute
title: s 192 - Exception for transactions with members or other group companies

Approval is not required under section 190 (requirement of members' approval for substantial property transactions)—
- (a) for a transaction between a company and a person in his character as a member of that company, or
- (b) for a transaction between—
	- (i) a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, or
	- (ii) two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same holding company.
```

### Definition of Group

```ad-statute
title: s 1159 CA 2006 - Meaning of “subsidiary” etc

(1) A company is a “subsidiary” of another company, its “holding company”, if that other company—
- (a) holds a majority of the voting rights in it, or
- (b) is a member of it and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, or
- (c) is a member of it and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other members, a majority of the voting rights in it,

or if it is a subsidiary of a company that is itself a subsidiary of that other company.

(2) A company is a “wholly-owned subsidiary” of another company if it has no members except that other and that other's wholly-owned subsidiaries or persons acting on behalf of that other or its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
```

Indirect holdings are taken into account, so this may include voting rights held through other subsidiaries, certain nominees and trustees.

### Group Indebtedness

A parent company is not liable for the debts of an insolvent subsidiary; the parent may even take priority to other creditors if, for example, it has loaned money to the subsidiary and taken security over its assets. Intra-group loans are common within groups of companies,

#### Guarantees

When a subsidiary is entering an agreement, a creditor may seek some form of guarantee/ security from the parent/ other company in the group which has a stronger financial standing.

### Group Accounts

CA 2006 imposes additional obligations on group companies.

#### Definition for Accounting

A slightly different definition of a group is used for accounting purposes from that used for other purposes (s 1162).

Differences:

1. The terms ‘parent undertaking’ and ‘subsidiary undertakings’ are employed. The definition of ‘undertaking’ includes companies, partnerships and unincorporated associations;
2. a parent/subsidiary relationship arises in a similar way to a holding company/subsidiary relationship . A company will be a parent undertaking for accounting purposes if:
	1. it has the right to exercise a dominant influence over the ‘subsidiary undertaking’, or
	2. it is managed on a unified basis with the ‘subsidiary undertaking’.

#### Obligation to Prepare Accounts

A parent company constituted in England and Wales is obliged to prepare consolidated annual accounts for the group, i.e., a profit and loss account and balance sheet incorporating the results, assets and liabilities of the parent and all the subsidiary undertakings in the group.

- Group accounts must be approved by the directors of the parent company and audited by its auditors.
- There is no obligation to produce group accounts where the group comes within the definition of a ‘small’ group.
- An intermediate parent company which is itself included in consolidated accounts does not generally have to produce group accounts; it must, however, file a copy of these consolidated accounts with the Registrar of Companies together with its own accounts.

### Taxation

The group is treated as a single entity for tax purposes. This is super beneficial for companies – it allows them to take greater advantage of reliefs as a whole.

## Group Reorganisations

Each company is a separate legal entity and should enter into an agreement for the transfer of assets only after due consideration. Any such transfer should be properly documented, and any tax considerations carefully examined.

### Why Transfer Assets Intra-group

- Improve efficiency
- Prepare a group company/ division for sale to a 3rd party
- Accommodate a new acquisition.

#### Transfers Before Sale to 3rd Party

A transfer may also be required in order to create a packaged unit for sale to an external third party. For example, the buyer may want to acquire a division, but the parties prefer the transaction to proceed as a share acquisition. Hive up/ hive down may be necessary.

```ad-action
If the intra-group transfer of assets is to be followed by a sale to an external third party, the third party buyer should investigate the terms of the intra-group transfer in case there are any latent tax liabilities or breaches of company law provisions.
```

### Documenting Transfer

- An intra-group transfer should be properly documented with details of the assets being transferred.
- Check contracts to ensure they will not be affected by clauses that may enable termination in the event of a change in control of the company.
- May involve obtaining consents from 3rd parties, as in an asset acquisition.

## Regulatory Issues on Intra-group Transfers

### Directors Duties

Duty owed to own company

- Directors of each company owe a duty to their own company (s 172).
- Directors of a particular company are not entitled to sacrifice the interests of that company for the interests of other members of the group ([[Charterbridge Corporation v Lloyds Bank Limited [1970] Ch 62]]).
- Even if the transfer does give rise to a potential breach of duty, if it is in the interests of other companies within the group, the breach may be ratified by the shareholders (provided it is lawful, within the objects of the company and the company is solvent).

#### Transfer at Book Value

- Intra-group transfers have traditionally been undertaken on the basis of the value of the assets as specified in the company’s accounts.
- A transfer at book value is potentially a breach of duty – seek confirmation from the holding company that the reorganisation is in the best interests of the group.

#### Distributions in Kind

- Intra-group transfer at an undervalue can also give rise to company law issues as a distribution in kind.
- For this deemed distribution in kind to be lawful, it must be made in accordance with the statutory provisions governing distributions, i.e., there must be sufficient distributable profits available for the distribution to be made.
- A deemed distribution in kind can be ratified by the shareholders, thereby rendering the distribution lawful.
- However, if the amount of the distribution exceeds distributable profits then the amount of the excess will be regarded as an unlawful reduction of the transferor’s capital and this will not be capable of ratification ([[Aveling Barford v Perion Ltd [1989] BCLC 626]]).
- s 845 CA 2006 provides that the amount of the distribution is calculated by reference to the book value of the asset.
	- If the asset is transferred at book value, distribution will be the amount by which the book value exceeds the consideration received for the asset.
	- If transfer is for less than book value, the distribution will be the amount by which the book value exceeds the consideration actually received by the company (s 846).
		- If the company had no, or insufficient, distributable profit available, the distribution will be unlawful and the amount of the unlawful distribution will be the full difference between the market value of the asset and the consideration actually received by the company (s 846).
		- Any member of the company who knows or has reasonable grounds for believing that the distribution is unlawful is liable to repay the distribution (s 847(2)(a)).

## Tax Implications of Intra-group Transfers

A transfer of assets between group companies is subject to the same general taxation principle as a sale to an external third party. A transfer of assets is taxed according to the nature of the asset transferred.

A group of companies may be treated as a single entity and such transfers may be treated as ‘tax neutral’ if they are within a particular tax group. There is no universal definition of a group for tax purposes.

### Classification of Subsidiaries

Groups are defined for tax purposes by reference to the percentage of ordinary share capital which companies hold in their subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are described, inter alia, as ‘51% subsidiaries’, ‘75% subsidiaries’ and ‘90% subsidiaries’ (CTA 2010, ss 1154–1157).

Certain ‘economic ownership tests’ must also be satisfied.

#### Ordinary Share Capital

Includes all the issued share capital of a company, other than capital the holders of which have a right to a dividend at a fixed rate but no other right to share in the profits of the company (s 1119).

Shares with no voting rights or carrying no rights to a dividend may still be classed as ordinary shares for this purpose.

#### Owned Directly or Indirectly

Indirect ownership means ownership through another company (note you might have to multiply % shareholdings to calculate the indirect holding).

#### Beneficial Ownership

The company must be the beneficial owner of the appropriate percentage of the share capital in the other company. A company which enters into an unconditional contract (or a conditional contract if the condition can be waived by the buyer) for the sale of the entire share capital of a subsidiary ceases to have beneficial ownership of the shares.

### Transfer of Income Assets

The transfer of a division is likely to involve the transfer of income assets such as stock or work in progress. In a group reorganisation such assets will often be transferred at cost and so would not give rise to a taxable profit.

In the event that an income profit has been made, there is scope to offset this profit against any trading losses that may have been made in another company.

#### Group Relief - S 131 CTA 2010

Group relief enables a company (the surrendering company) which has incurred a trading loss in an accounting period, or which has charges on income or loan relationship debits, such as interest payments, to surrender these to another member of the group (the claimant company). This reduces liability to corporation tax.

- The claimant company must first deduct its own charges on income and any current or brought forward losses.
- Historically only losses in the current period could be transferred, but as of 2017 losses carried forward to subsequent accounting periods can also be surrendered to other group companies.
- If the claimant company pays the surrendering company for the use of the trading losses, etc, the payment itself does not affect the tax position of either company, provided it does not exceed the amount of losses surrendered (CTA 2010, s 183).

#### Applicable Groups

- Two companies are members of a group for the purposes of this relief if one is a 75% subsidiary of the other, or if both are 75% subsidiaries of a third (CTA 2010, s 152).
- The surrendering and claimant companies should both be ‘UK related’ (CTA 2010, s 134)

#### Joining Leaving Group

s 154 of CTA 2010 is designed to prevent the artificial manipulation of group relief by the forming of groups on a temporary basis in order to obtain relief.

A company will not be regarded as a member of the group if ‘**arrangements**’ are in existence for the transfer of that company to another group: relief is not available during any period when such arrangements are in force ([[Shepherd (Inspector of Taxes) v Law Land plc [1990] STC 795]]).

```ad-question
When is there an arrangement?
```

1. Arrangements will not normally come into existence in the case of a straightforward sale of a company before the date of the acceptance (subject to contract or on a similar conditional basis) of the offer;
2. where a disposal of shares requires approval of shareholders, no arrangement will come into existence until that approval has been given or the directors are aware that it will be given;
3. ‘arrangements’ might exist if there is an ‘understanding between the parties in the character of an option’ for a potential buyer to acquire shares.

### Transfer of Capital Assets

If capital assets are transferred within a defined group then the transfer will be deemed as tax neutral (TCGA 1992, s 171).

Such a disposal is treated as being for such a consideration as not to give rise to either a capital gain or loss, i.e., the consideration is treated as being equal to the original acquisition cost of the asset.

```ad-important
If that asset is transferred out of that defined group, or the company that received that asset leaves the defined group within six years of receiving that asset, then a tax charge will arise.
```

#### Definition of Group

Definition of a group for the purposes of transfer of capital assets – s 170 TCGA 1992.

- Principal company forms a group with all its 75% subsidiaries
- the group also includes any 75% subsidiaries of those subsidiaries (and so on) if they are ‘effective 51% subsidiaries’ of the principal company;
- for a subsidiary to be an ‘effective 51% subsidiary’, the principal company must be beneficially entitled to more than 50% of any profits available (multiplying % entitlements) for distribution to equity holders of the subsidiary and more than 50% of any assets available for distribution to equity holders on a winding up;
- a company which is a 75% subsidiary of another company cannot itself be a principal company unless it is prevented from being part of a group because it fails the ‘effective 51% subsidiary’ test.

```ad-statute
title: s 170(7) TCGA 1992
For the purposes of this section and sections 171 to 181, a company (“the subsidiary”) is an effective 51 per cent. subsidiary of another company (“the parent”) at any time if and only if—

- (a) the parent is beneficially entitled to more than 50 per cent. of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of the subsidiary; and

- (b) the parent would be beneficially entitled to more than 50 per cent. of any assets of the subsidiary available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up.
```

#### Degrouping Charge on Company Leaving Group

A potential corporation tax charge on the postponed capital gain will be triggered if the company leaves the group within **6 years** of receiving the asset from another group member on a no gain/no loss basis.

S 179 TCGA 1992 provides that, on leaving a group, a company is treated as if it had sold and immediately re-acquired any asset which had been transferred to it from another member of the group within the previous six years.

Disposal and reacquisition is deemed to have taken place on the date the asset was last acquired intra-group.

```ad-question
title: Who bears the loss?
- The departing company used to bear the degrouping gain/ loss. 
- Finance Act 2011: different provisions now apply to degrouping charges which arise as a reult of a disposal of shares. 
- Any degrouping gain or loss will accrue to the company making the share disposal (ie the **seller**) and will be taken into account as part of the proceeds of the share disposal,
- The departing company will continue to be deemed to have made the aforementioned disposal and immediate reacquisition of the asset.
```

- Degrouping gain
	- The seller can apply its available reliefs and exemptions, most notably the substantial shareholding exemption if applicable.
		- The departing company will see an uplift in the base cost of the relevant asset (even if the gain ends up being exempt for the seller).
- Degrouping loss
	- This will not be available to the seller (i.e., to offset other gains) if the substantial shareholding exemption applies
	- The departing company will see a reduction in the base cost of the capital asset.

Upon leaving the group, a company is deemed to have sold the land for its most recent market value and immediately reacquired it at that value – so the last transaction becomes chargeable in the normal way upon a company leaving the group.

#### Variation for Share Transfer

- If shares are the asset being transferred then the substantial shareholdings exemption may be applied to the degrouping gain or loss if the company owning the substantial shareholding at the time of the degrouping would have been entitled to the exemption.
- When the holding is transferred intra-group, the company receiving the transfer is treated as having acquired it at the same time at which the transferor acquired it.
- If the shareholding has been held within the group for a continuous period of 12 months, the exiting company will qualify for the exemption.
- The company leaving the group is treated as if it had sold and then reacquired the shareholding immediately before the degrouping, though there will be no charge to tax, and the base cost of the shareholding following the deemed sale and reacquisition will be the market value of it immediately before the degrouping.

#### Transferring Asset Out of the Group

Charge to corporation tax on any resultant gain. The gain is the consideration received on transferring the asset out of the group – the price paid by the member who first brought it into the group.

#### Practical Law

Intra-group share and asset transfers are often conducted at book value (or even less). However, if the resulting consideration is less than the market value of the assets, this approach exposes the group to a number of potential company law problems, all of which carry serious penalties or consequences.

If the group elects to avoid the legal problems associated with book value transfers by transferring the assets at full market value, it will need to determine what market value is.

### Intangible Assets and Loan Relationships

ss 775-776 CTA 2009

- If intangible assets (e.g., IP) transferred within a defined group, the transfer will be deemed tax neutral.
- Defined group basically the same as that for capital assets under s 170 TCGA 1992.
- If the receiving company leaves the defined group it is subject to a degrouping charge.

```ad-important
Rather than arising at the start of the accounting period in which it leaves the group, as for a capital asset, the resulting degrouping charge arises immediately before the transferee leaves the group.
```

### Stamp Duty and SDLT

Complete relief from stamp duty is available on a transfer of shares between companies where one company is a 75% subsidiary of the other or both are 75% subsidiaries of a third company (Finance Act 1930, s 42, as amended).

To check:

- Direct and indirect shareholdings
- Economic ownership tests

For the purposes of SDLT, intra-group transactions are deemed to take place at market value regardless of the actual consideration given (Finance Act 2003, s 53). However, it is generally possible to claim group relief (subject to certain anti-avoidance provisions). The group relief for SDLT purposes is broadly the same as for stamp duty (Finance Act 2003, Sch 7).

SDLT group relief can be clawed back if, within three years of the effective date of the intra-group land transaction, the transferee leaves the group of which it and the transferor were members and it, or a relevant associated company, holds the land that was transferred intra-group (Finance Act 2003, Sch 7, para 3).
