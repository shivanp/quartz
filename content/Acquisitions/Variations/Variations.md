# Asset Acquisitions

## Agreeing What to Transfer

Consider an asset acquisition where the buyer's objective is to continue to run the target business after its acquisition, either as a stand-alone business or by incorporation of the acquired assets.

### Common Law Approach

Terms of the acquisition set out in the SPA, possibly with further details in the schedules. Usual to include a definition of the “business” of the target, together with provisions dealing with the transfer of goodwill. Parties will often include a list of assets specifically excluded (usually including cash, debtors, creditors).

In E&W, on an asset acquisition, each asset/ liability must be specifically identified and individually transferred in the manner required for the particular asset/ liability. Exception: certain employment obligations and environmental liabilities which transfer with the land.

US asset acquisition requires compliance with applicable bulk sales statutes. Enacted by the majority of US states to protect the buyer in an asset acquisition. To protect the buyer from claims by the seller's creditors, the seller must complete a list (usually be affidavit) of existing creditors.

Bulk sale statutes generally require that each of the creditors is given notice a certain period before the transfer of the business takes place. If the registration process is not completed by a buyer, creditors of the seller may obtain a declaration that the sale was invalid as against them and repossess goods.

### Timing

SPA should specify timing of the completion of an asset acquisition. Usually specifies that the transfer of all required assets will take place simultaneously at completion. Sometimes a formal transfer of assets at completion is not possible (e.g., if consent to the transfer is required). Then the SPA usually provides that the seller will hold the asset on trust for the benefit of the buyer pending the formal transfer (but able to use it for the purposes of business in the meantime).

An “effective time” of transfer may be specified (in large multi-jurisdictional transfers).

## Transfer of Assets

### Contracts

#### Passing Benefit and Burden

The buyer should ensure it receives the benefit of all contracts entered into between the seller and 3rd parties, which are important to enable the business to continue trading after the completion of the acquisition.

Under English law, can do this by assigning the benefit of the contract. If legal assignment is required, notice must be given to the other contracting party (s 136 LPA 1925). This is desirable – otherwise the 3rd party can continue making payments to the seller.

> [!warning]
> This method only transfers the benefit of the contract, so the seller will still be liable to the 3rd party for any outstanding obligations.

> [!example]
> In an exclusive distribution agreement, if the seller is the distributor, the benefit under the agreement is the receipt of goods for resale in a given territory; the burden is payment for the goods. Under English law, the right to receive the goods can be legally assigned by giving notice under s 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (unless the contract says consent is required), but the obligation to pay for the goods remains with the seller.

To get around this, the existing contract can be **novated**. Involves the other party to the contract agreeing to release the seller from the contract, allowing the buyer to take over the benefit and burden. The parties to the novation agreement will be the buyer, the seller and the 3rd party.

> [!note]
> Because this involves the cooperation of the third party, can be time-consuming. 

### Debtors and Creditors

Sums owed to the seller by third parties (debtors) are an asset of the business; sums owed by the seller to third parties (creditors) are a liability of the business.

#### Transfer to Buyer

In E&W, the debtors and creditors may be transferred to the buyer. Full details should be included in a schedule or appendix to SPA. For the assignment of debts to be a legal assignment (not an equitable one), s 136 LPA 1925 requires written notice of the assignment to be given to each debtor.

Seller will remain liable to its creditors after completion, unless creditors agree to release it. So when parties have agreed to transfer creditors, the seller should seek an indemnity from the buyer against such liability.

But it can be tricky to transfer debtors and creditors:

- Complications of accurately defining the debts and liabilities involved
- Must give notice to all creditors
- Difficult to value book debts

The seller may be prepared to warrant that the debts are fully recoverable.

#### Retention by Seller

Possible for debtors and creditors to remain with the seller. Buyer will be keen to preserve goodwill of the ongoing business. So will want the seller to pay creditors promptly and not be too wild in chasing debtors. Buyer may insist on a retention from the purchase price to be released once creditors have been paid. Should consider getting an undertaking from the seller not to issue proceed debt recovery proceeding for a specified period/ give the buyer the option to buy debts from the seller at the end of this period.

But the seller may no longer have means to collect the debts after completion (e.g., if its employees have been transferred to the buyer). So often the buyer agrees to collect debts as the agent of the seller. The buyer will be required to use reasonable endeavours to collect the debts without being obliged to commence legal proceedings.

SPA should specify what happens to sums received by the buyer after completion, in respect of business conducted before completion.

# Share Acquisitions

## Transfer of Shares

### The Company

The buyer will want to seek reassurances about the target company through the provision of warranty statements. The list of warranties in a share SPA is likely to be longer than with an asset acquisition due to the greater risk which a buyer of shares assumes.

# Private Equity

## Overview

- Investment in the share capital of a private company
- Provision of finance to new developing businesses/ underperforming companies (both private and public).
- Lightly regulated; conflicts of interest and over-leveraging.
- The EU has passed the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (2011/61/EU), which was implemented in the UK by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/1773) (AIFMR 2013) which came into force on 22 July 2013.
- Implements a harmonised regulatory framework across the EU for EU-established managers of alternative investment funds (AIFMs)
	- Must be authorised
	- Adherence to strict capital requirements
	- Systems for managing risk, liquidity and conflicts
	- Disclosures
- Managing an alternative investment fund is a regulated activity (RAO 2001)

### Provider

- Specialist PE funds created whereby the investors agree to form a limited partnership to provide funds to be invested.
- Legislative Reform (Private Fund Limited Partnerships) Order 2017 created “private fund limited partnerships”, which have simplified regulation.
- Fund will have a statement about the investments it can and cannot make.
- Allocation is a decision made by a PE provider (i.e., PE house/ PE fund manager).
	- PE fund delegates investment management duties to the PE fund manager, benefitting from expertise.
	- PE provider makes profits through making and managing and divesting investments. Receives fees for doing so.
	- Typically, there is an annual management fee and performance fee (commonly 2/20)
- Investors in PE fund make profit primarily through capital growth.

### Decision to Invest

PE provider will follow an agreed internal procedure for approving an investment. This can impact the timetable of an investment. Typically:

1. Investment paper presented to an investment committee
2. Acquisition offer made on the basis of the initial approval.
3. Investment of funds provided through corporate investment structures.
4. Often there are layered structures (“structural subordination”) in tax-efficient jurisdictions.

### Types of Investments

Broadly 3 categories of PE investments:

1. Start-up capital
2. Development capital
3. Buyouts.

For (1) and (2), the investment is usually a subscription for shares in the existing company. For (3), depends (e.g., management buyout, institutional leveraged buyout).

The method chosen depends both on the type and size of the buyout.

| Type of buyout                 | Method of investment                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small management buyout        | Direct subscription of shares                             |
| Large management buyout        | Lots of debt finance, corporate structure may be created. |
| Institutional leveraged buyout | Complex corporate structure.                                                           |

## Management Buyout

> [!defn] "MBO"
> A transaction by which the target is acquired by some or all of its management, usually through the vehicle of a new company established for this purpose (‘Newco’).

- May proceed as share or asset acquisitions
- Usually requires external funding – a business plan is drawn up to seek PE funding.
- Often several PE providers invited to bid.
- Financing is a mix of equity finance from the management team and PE provider, and debt finance secured on the assets of the target.
- In a management buyout instigated by existing management, PE provider expects the management team to provide a substantial investment to ensure the team is committed financially.
- PE provider usually takes a majority shareholding, but may accept a minority if it has the option of taking more control.

### Investment

Investment made through a new corporate vehicle (Newco). PE provider and management team subscribe for ordinary shares in Newco, though rights are carefully negotiated.

PE provider gets some redeemable preference shares carrying preferential rights to receive income by dividends and return of capital on a winding up of Newco.

Parties to the venture enter into an Investment Agreement. Sets out the basis of investment, any required restrictions, and relevant provisions. Traditional MBO: the investment agreement also includes extensive warranties about the target business and the business plan drawn up by the team. Sometimes the PE provider insists on the management team also warranting key information.

### Conflicts of Interest

> [!warning]
> Take care to ensure the actions of the management team do not breach any obligations of good faith or confidentiality to the target. 

1. Management team wants to get the best price
2. But they also owe duties to the company and its shareholders and employees.

> [!action]
> Upon deciding to initiate an MBO, approach the board to declare the director's interest and seek consent to proceed.

#### Consideration

Under English law, management buyouts may also give rise to consideration of s 190 of the CA 2006 and the need for shareholders’ approval where a company buys an asset from or sells an asset to a director.

If the director will hold shares in the corporate vehicle created for the purpose of the buyout (Newco) then this could fall within the classification of a company ‘connected’ with the director under s 254 CA 2006. Although a single director is unlikely to hold the relevant 20% holding required for Newco to be a company connected with the director under s 254(2), the legislation refers to a 20% holding by a director and/or the director’s connected persons. So might need shareholder approval under s 190 (SPT).

### Warranties

Another feature of MBO transactions is warranty provision. More negotiation than a traditional asset or share sale. Seller likely to resist extensive warranties included in the SPA on the basis that the managers buying the target are likely to know more than the shareholders. But remember, warranties are about risk allocation and discovery.

## Institutional Leveraged Buyouts

PE provider hoping to acquire a majority shareholding in a private company with the potential to generate substantial profits. PE provider managing funds created by institutional investors. Often there are multiple PE providers bidding for the right to acquire the company.

### Debt/ Equity Ratio

Ratio is a commercial question. Consider the internal rate of return; the lower the amount of equity, the greater the gains per share. Often there is lots and lots of debt (especially since debt was cheap until recently).

> [!important]
> Private companies are not subject to prohibitions on financial assistance. So any borrowing for the acquisition of target's shares can be secured on the assets of target. Where a public company is acquired by a PE fund, the public target is first immediately converted to a private company (to allow this to happen). 

### Management Team

#### Leveraged Buyout

Often a mix of the existing managers and external managers brought in by the PE provider. Provided with a financial incentive – usually through a class of equity shares called “sweet equity”. Management can sell this when the target is sold.

Management team expected to give warranties in relation to its business plan and information about the target. Usually driven by a concern to establish the management team's full commitment to the process (rather than risk allocation). Sellers usually provide full warranties and claims made against sellers.

### Common Structures

To accommodate varying interests and maximise security/ tax planning, the PE provider will not invest directly into the acquired company. Corporate structure used.

1. Holding/ top company acting as the investment vehicle.
2. Wholly owned subsidiary A which undertakes the bank borrowing needed to provide the balance of the acquisition cost.
3. Actual purchase of the target made by subsidiary A or its subsidiary, subsidiary B

The companies undertaking the debt finance and the purchase of the target company will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of the top company. The equity investment is placed in the top company, which will be responsible for overseeing the operation of the investment, as governed by the terms of the investment agreement and by appropriate provisions in its articles.

## Key Documentation

3 key parties to any buyout:

1. PE provider
2. Debt financiers
3. Management team.

Each has their own aims and objectives, and seek to manage the risks they agree to take on as part of the buyout, through:

1. Corporate buyout structure
2. Terms of documentation governing investment
3. Rights attaching to equity shares acquired.

### Investment Agreement

Contractual document setting out the agreed terms of the proposed investment, ongoing management of the target, and terms of any proposed realisation.

Terms take precedence over any other documentation required (e.g., loan agreements, service contracts) – and explicitly states this.

Intended primarily to cover the terms of the equity investment, but debt finance providers often also party to it. On a management buyout, the providers of debt finance will enter the facility agreements setting out the terms on which they are prepared to loan the required funds and the terms of any charges/ security.

On larger leveraged buy-outs, in addition to simple loans the debt providers may also provide debt with an option to convert into equity, or even a level of debt which is unsecured.

#### Terms of the Investment

Specifies how the money required for the proposed purchase will be raised. Includes how much money is invested by the PE provider and management team, as well as the proportion raised by borrowing.

PE investor:

- Small proportion of ordinary shares
- Remainder in preference shares.
- Occasionally debt securities.

Details of proposed acquisition, including conditions precedent to the transaction. So various parties all sign the investment agreement, but each party becomes committed to making its investment and proceeding with the acquisition only once other parties have made respective investments.

Management warranties expected on a traditional MBO, and also on an institutional leveraged buyout if the existing management are given the opportunity to take an equity stake.

#### Governance

Investment agreement sets out the agreed structures for the ongoing management of the target. Depends on whether the PE provider has taken a majority stake.

If PE provider has a minority stake, the provider will want strict restrictions on the activities of the target. If it already has a majority, doesn't care so much (already has control).

Institutional leveraged buyout: provider will require a majority stake and will require provisions to monitor the investment and take control of the top company/ subsidiaries if needed.

Restrictions imposed vary with each transaction. The agreement may provide for

- the right to appoint/ dismiss board members,
- right to obtain information, and
- right to veto certain decisions.

Restrictions reflected in the articles of the top company and expressed as rights attaching to a particular class of shares.

#### Realisation of Investment

The investment agreement will usually include provisions relating to the intended realisation of the investment – usually a 5-year horizon. A listing is the most desirable outcome for the PE provider. Documentation will provide for the conversion of a particular class of shares into ordinary shares prior to the shares being admitted to trading. Otherwise, a sale to another PE provider/ a trade sale may occur.

##### Warranties

Buyer will expect the seller to provide warranties about the company. But a PE provider will not be prepared to give such warranties, as the money it realises from the investment must be returned to the private equity funds and cannot be subject to a possible later charge. So the investment agreement will include words to this effect.

##### Transfer of Shares

The investment agreement also includes agreed forms of the constitution of the company in which the investment is taking place. Usually prohibits the transfer of shares by the management team, except for mandatory sale if the director leaves (dismissal/ retirement/ death). Price paid for shares depends on if the manager is a “good” or “bad” leaver. On a traditional MBO, provisions heavily negotiated.

The agreed constitution also includes provisions relating to the **permitted** transfer of shares (drag along/ tag along provisions).

- Drag along provision imposed on any minority management shareholders.
	- Enables PE provider to force minority shareholders to sell their shares when realising investment.
- Tag along
	- Minority shareholder allowed to join in any sale of shares where an offer has been made to the private equity provider.

### Associated Documentation

#### Investment

- The parties to the transaction must agree the terms of the constitution of the top company. Sets out the agreed class rights of each type of share to be issued.
- The constitution includes any agreed restrictions on the transfer of shares and provisions regarding mandatory sales where a manager is dismissed or offer for shares received.
- The managers will be employees of the top company, and the terms of their service contracts must be negotiated.

#### Debt Finance

- The bank may be a party to the investment agreement on an institutional buyout if it is subscribing for debt securities that can be converted into equity securities.
- There is separate banking documentation to govern the provision of debt finance. This usually includes a bank facility agreement specifying the amount of money lent.
- The bank requires a package of documentation detailing the security over assets of the target.
- Also an inter-creditor agreement setting out an agreed order of priority.

#### Acquisition

The acquisition process is the same as on a trade acquisition, but the focus is on investment potential. Many PE deals progress by structured auction, where the seller controls the process and summarises due diligence.

Buyer-led due diligence can be problematic (especially for warranty provision), if the management comprises existing managers. Common for investors to take out warranty and indemnity insurance to cover an element of the risk inherent in private equity transactions. The buyer and seller then enter an SPA as normal.

# Group Reorganisations

## Group Companies

Groups of companies are popular:

- Each company has a separate legal personality and limited liability
- Risky businesses packaged into separate subsidiaries.

Groups can come about in various ways:

- Enterprise formed as a group
- Splitting up a large concern (hiving down)
- M&A

In company law, each company within the group is treated as a separate entity with its own assets and liabilities.

### Extension of Restrictions to Group Companies

- Membership of holding company prohibited
	- s 136 CA 2006 prohibits a subsidiary/ nominee from being a member of its holding company and renders any transfer/ issue of holding company shares to a subsidiary/ nominee void, except where the subsidiary is acting as a trustee or as an authorised dealer in securities.
- SPTs prohibited
	- Section 190 of the CA 2006 requires the passing of an ordinary resolution of the members of a company where a director of the company or its holding company acquires an asset from the company or disposes of an asset to the company which is ‘substantial’.
	- If the director is a director of its holding company, an ordinary resolution of the holding company is also necessary to approve the transaction.
	- No approval is required under s 190, however, by any company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary (s 190(4)(b)).
	- See workshop 9 for an example.
- Loans to directors
	- s 197 CA 2006: shareholder approval is required for a company to make loans to its directors
	- If a loan is to be made to a director of the company’s holding company, the approval of the members of the holding company must also be sought.

> [!statute] s 192 - Exception for transactions with members or other group companies
> 
> Approval is not required under section 190 (requirement of members' approval for substantial property transactions)—
> - (a) for a transaction between a company and a person in his character as a member of that company, or
> - (b) for a transaction between—
> 	- (i) a holding company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, or
> 	- (ii) two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same holding company.

### Definition of Group

> [!statute] s 1159 CA 2006 - Meaning of “subsidiary” etc
> 
> (1) A company is a “subsidiary” of another company, its “holding company”, if that other company—
> - (a) holds a majority of the voting rights in it, or
> - (b) is a member of it and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors, or
> - (c) is a member of it and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other members, a majority of the voting rights in it,
> 
> or if it is a subsidiary of a company that is itself a subsidiary of that other company.
> 
> (2) A company is a “wholly-owned subsidiary” of another company if it has no members except that other and that other's wholly-owned subsidiaries or persons acting on behalf of that other or its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Indirect holdings are taken into account, so this may include voting rights held through other subsidiaries, certain nominees and trustees.

### Group Indebtedness

A parent company is not liable for the debts of an insolvent subsidiary; the parent may even take priority to other creditors if, for example, it has loaned money to the subsidiary and taken security over its assets. Intra-group loans are common within groups of companies,

#### Guarantees

When a subsidiary is entering an agreement, a creditor may seek some form of guarantee/ security from the parent/ other company in the group which has a stronger financial standing.

### Group Accounts

CA 2006 imposes additional obligations on group companies.

#### Definition for Accounting

A slightly different definition of a group is used for accounting purposes from that used for other purposes (s 1162).

Differences:

1. The terms ‘parent undertaking’ and ‘subsidiary undertakings’ are employed. The definition of ‘undertaking’ includes companies, partnerships and unincorporated associations;
2. a parent/subsidiary relationship arises in a similar way to a holding company/subsidiary relationship . A company will be a parent undertaking for accounting purposes if:
	1. it has the right to exercise a dominant influence over the ‘subsidiary undertaking’, or
	2. it is managed on a unified basis with the ‘subsidiary undertaking’.

#### Obligation to Prepare Accounts

A parent company constituted in England and Wales is obliged to prepare consolidated annual accounts for the group, i.e., a profit and loss account and balance sheet incorporating the results, assets and liabilities of the parent and all the subsidiary undertakings in the group.

- Group accounts must be approved by the directors of the parent company and audited by its auditors.
- There is no obligation to produce group accounts where the group comes within the definition of a ‘small’ group.
- An intermediate parent company which is itself included in consolidated accounts does not generally have to produce group accounts; it must, however, file a copy of these consolidated accounts with the Registrar of Companies together with its own accounts.

### Taxation

The group is treated as a single entity for tax purposes. This is super beneficial for companies – it allows them to take greater advantage of reliefs as a whole.

## Group Reorganisations

Each company is a separate legal entity and should enter into an agreement for the transfer of assets only after due consideration. Any such transfer should be properly documented, and any tax considerations carefully examined.

### Why Transfer Assets Intra-group

- Improve efficiency
- Prepare a group company/ division for sale to a 3rd party
- Accommodate a new acquisition.

#### Transfers Before Sale to 3rd Party

A transfer may also be required in order to create a packaged unit for sale to an external third party. For example, the buyer may want to acquire a division, but the parties prefer the transaction to proceed as a share acquisition. Hive up/ hive down may be necessary.

> [!action]
> If the intra-group transfer of assets is to be followed by a sale to an external third party, the third party buyer should investigate the terms of the intra-group transfer in case there are any latent tax liabilities or breaches of company law provisions.

### Documenting Transfer

- An intra-group transfer should be properly documented with details of the assets being transferred.
- Check contracts to ensure they will not be affected by clauses that may enable termination in the event of a change in control of the company.
- May involve obtaining consents from 3rd parties, as in an asset acquisition.

## Regulatory Issues on Intra-group Transfers

### Directors Duties

Duty owed to own company

- Directors of each company owe a duty to their own company (s 172).
- Directors of a particular company are not entitled to sacrifice the interests of that company for the interests of other members of the group ([[Charterbridge Corporation v Lloyds Bank Limited [1970] Ch 62]]).
- Even if the transfer does give rise to a potential breach of duty, if it is in the interests of other companies within the group, the breach may be ratified by the shareholders (provided it is lawful, within the objects of the company and the company is solvent).

#### Transfer at Book Value

- Intra-group transfers have traditionally been undertaken on the basis of the value of the assets as specified in the company’s accounts.
- A transfer at book value is potentially a breach of duty – seek confirmation from the holding company that the reorganisation is in the best interests of the group.

#### Distributions in Kind

- Intra-group transfer at an undervalue can also give rise to company law issues as a distribution in kind.
- For this deemed distribution in kind to be lawful, it must be made in accordance with the statutory provisions governing distributions, i.e., there must be sufficient distributable profits available for the distribution to be made.
- A deemed distribution in kind can be ratified by the shareholders, thereby rendering the distribution lawful.
- However, if the amount of the distribution exceeds distributable profits then the amount of the excess will be regarded as an unlawful reduction of the transferor’s capital and this will not be capable of ratification ([[Aveling Barford v Perion Ltd [1989] BCLC 626]]).
- s 845 CA 2006 provides that the amount of the distribution is calculated by reference to the book value of the asset.
	- If the asset is transferred at book value, distribution will be the amount by which the book value exceeds the consideration received for the asset.
	- If transfer is for less than book value, the distribution will be the amount by which the book value exceeds the consideration actually received by the company (s 846).
		- If the company had no, or insufficient, distributable profit available, the distribution will be unlawful and the amount of the unlawful distribution will be the full difference between the market value of the asset and the consideration actually received by the company (s 846).
		- Any member of the company who knows or has reasonable grounds for believing that the distribution is unlawful is liable to repay the distribution (s 847(2)(a)).

## Tax Implications of Intra-group Transfers

A transfer of assets between group companies is subject to the same general taxation principle as a sale to an external third party. A transfer of assets is taxed according to the nature of the asset transferred.

A group of companies may be treated as a single entity and such transfers may be treated as ‘tax neutral’ if they are within a particular tax group. There is no universal definition of a group for tax purposes.

### Classification of Subsidiaries

Groups are defined for tax purposes by reference to the percentage of ordinary share capital which companies hold in their subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are described, inter alia, as ‘51% subsidiaries’, ‘75% subsidiaries’ and ‘90% subsidiaries’ (CTA 2010, ss 1154–1157).

Certain ‘economic ownership tests’ must also be satisfied.

#### Ordinary Share Capital

Includes all the issued share capital of a company, other than capital the holders of which have a right to a dividend at a fixed rate but no other right to share in the profits of the company (s 1119).

Shares with no voting rights or carrying no rights to a dividend may still be classed as ordinary shares for this purpose.

#### Owned Directly or Indirectly

Indirect ownership means ownership through another company (note you might have to multiply % shareholdings to calculate the indirect holding).

#### Beneficial Ownership

The company must be the beneficial owner of the appropriate percentage of the share capital in the other company. A company which enters into an unconditional contract (or a conditional contract if the condition can be waived by the buyer) for the sale of the entire share capital of a subsidiary ceases to have beneficial ownership of the shares.

### Transfer of Income Assets

The transfer of a division is likely to involve the transfer of income assets such as stock or work in progress. In a group reorganisation such assets will often be transferred at cost and so would not give rise to a taxable profit.

In the event that an income profit has been made, there is scope to offset this profit against any trading losses that may have been made in another company.

#### Group Relief - S 131 CTA 2010

Group relief enables a company (the surrendering company) which has incurred a trading loss in an accounting period, or which has charges on income or loan relationship debits, such as interest payments, to surrender these to another member of the group (the claimant company). This reduces liability to corporation tax.

- The claimant company must first deduct its own charges on income and any current or brought forward losses.
- Historically only losses in the current period could be transferred, but as of 2017 losses carried forward to subsequent accounting periods can also be surrendered to other group companies.
- If the claimant company pays the surrendering company for the use of the trading losses, etc, the payment itself does not affect the tax position of either company, provided it does not exceed the amount of losses surrendered (CTA 2010, s 183).

#### Applicable Groups

- Two companies are members of a group for the purposes of this relief if one is a 75% subsidiary of the other, or if both are 75% subsidiaries of a third (CTA 2010, s 152).
- The surrendering and claimant companies should both be ‘UK related’ (CTA 2010, s 134)

#### Joining Leaving Group

s 154 of CTA 2010 is designed to prevent the artificial manipulation of group relief by the forming of groups on a temporary basis in order to obtain relief.

A company will not be regarded as a member of the group if ‘**arrangements**’ are in existence for the transfer of that company to another group: relief is not available during any period when such arrangements are in force ([[Shepherd (Inspector of Taxes) v Law Land plc [1990] STC 795]]).

> [!question]
> When is there an arrangement?

1. Arrangements will not normally come into existence in the case of a straightforward sale of a company before the date of the acceptance (subject to contract or on a similar conditional basis) of the offer;
2. where a disposal of shares requires approval of shareholders, no arrangement will come into existence until that approval has been given or the directors are aware that it will be given;
3. ‘arrangements’ might exist if there is an ‘understanding between the parties in the character of an option’ for a potential buyer to acquire shares.

### Transfer of Capital Assets

If capital assets are transferred within a defined group then the transfer will be deemed as tax neutral (TCGA 1992, s 171).

Such a disposal is treated as being for such a consideration as not to give rise to either a capital gain or loss, i.e., the consideration is treated as being equal to the original acquisition cost of the asset.

> [!important]
> If that asset is transferred out of that defined group, or the company that received that asset leaves the defined group within six years of receiving that asset, then a tax charge will arise.

#### Definition of Group

Definition of a group for the purposes of transfer of capital assets – s 170 TCGA 1992.

- Principal company forms a group with all its 75% subsidiaries
- the group also includes any 75% subsidiaries of those subsidiaries (and so on) if they are ‘effective 51% subsidiaries’ of the principal company;
- for a subsidiary to be an ‘effective 51% subsidiary’, the principal company must be beneficially entitled to more than 50% of any profits available (multiplying % entitlements) for distribution to equity holders of the subsidiary and more than 50% of any assets available for distribution to equity holders on a winding up;
- a company which is a 75% subsidiary of another company cannot itself be a principal company unless it is prevented from being part of a group because it fails the ‘effective 51% subsidiary’ test.

> [!statute] s 170(7) TCGA 1992
> For the purposes of this section and sections 171 to 181, a company (“the subsidiary”) is an effective 51 per cent. subsidiary of another company (“the parent”) at any time if and only if—
> 
> - (a) the parent is beneficially entitled to more than 50 per cent. of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of the subsidiary; and
> 
> - (b) the parent would be beneficially entitled to more than 50 per cent. of any assets of the subsidiary available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up.

#### Degrouping Charge on Company Leaving Group

A potential corporation tax charge on the postponed capital gain will be triggered if the company leaves the group within **6 years** of receiving the asset from another group member on a no gain/no loss basis.

S 179 TCGA 1992 provides that, on leaving a group, a company is treated as if it had sold and immediately re-acquired any asset which had been transferred to it from another member of the group within the previous six years.

Disposal and reacquisition is deemed to have taken place on the date the asset was last acquired intra-group.

> [!question] Who bears the loss?
> - The departing company used to bear the degrouping gain/ loss. 
> - Finance Act 2011: different provisions now apply to degrouping charges which arise as a reult of a disposal of shares. 
> - Any degrouping gain or loss will accrue to the company making the share disposal (ie the **seller**) and will be taken into account as part of the proceeds of the share disposal,
> - The departing company will continue to be deemed to have made the aforementioned disposal and immediate reacquisition of the asset.

- Degrouping gain
	- The seller can apply its available reliefs and exemptions, most notably the substantial shareholding exemption if applicable.
		- The departing company will see an uplift in the base cost of the relevant asset (even if the gain ends up being exempt for the seller).
- Degrouping loss
	- This will not be available to the seller (i.e., to offset other gains) if the substantial shareholding exemption applies
	- The departing company will see a reduction in the base cost of the capital asset.

Upon leaving the group, a company is deemed to have sold the land for its most recent market value and immediately reacquired it at that value – so the last transaction becomes chargeable in the normal way upon a company leaving the group.

#### Variation for Share Transfer

- If shares are the asset being transferred then the substantial shareholdings exemption may be applied to the degrouping gain or loss if the company owning the substantial shareholding at the time of the degrouping would have been entitled to the exemption.
- When the holding is transferred intra-group, the company receiving the transfer is treated as having acquired it at the same time at which the transferor acquired it.
- If the shareholding has been held within the group for a continuous period of 12 months, the exiting company will qualify for the exemption.
- The company leaving the group is treated as if it had sold and then reacquired the shareholding immediately before the degrouping, though there will be no charge to tax, and the base cost of the shareholding following the deemed sale and reacquisition will be the market value of it immediately before the degrouping.

#### Transferring Asset Out of the Group

Charge to corporation tax on any resultant gain. The gain is the consideration received on transferring the asset out of the group – the price paid by the member who first brought it into the group.

#### Practical Law

Intra-group share and asset transfers are often conducted at book value (or even less). However, if the resulting consideration is less than the market value of the assets, this approach exposes the group to a number of potential company law problems, all of which carry serious penalties or consequences.

If the group elects to avoid the legal problems associated with book value transfers by transferring the assets at full market value, it will need to determine what market value is.

### Intangible Assets and Loan Relationships

ss 775-776 CTA 2009

- If intangible assets (e.g., IP) transferred within a defined group, the transfer will be deemed tax neutral.
- Defined group basically the same as that for capital assets under s 170 TCGA 1992.
- If the receiving company leaves the defined group it is subject to a degrouping charge.

> [!important]
> Rather than arising at the start of the accounting period in which it leaves the group, as for a capital asset, the resulting degrouping charge arises immediately before the transferee leaves the group.

### Stamp Duty and SDLT

Complete relief from stamp duty is available on a transfer of shares between companies where one company is a 75% subsidiary of the other or both are 75% subsidiaries of a third company (Finance Act 1930, s 42, as amended).

To check:

- Direct and indirect shareholdings
- Economic ownership tests

For the purposes of SDLT, intra-group transactions are deemed to take place at market value regardless of the actual consideration given (Finance Act 2003, s 53). However, it is generally possible to claim group relief (subject to certain anti-avoidance provisions). The group relief for SDLT purposes is broadly the same as for stamp duty (Finance Act 2003, Sch 7).

SDLT group relief can be clawed back if, within three years of the effective date of the intra-group land transaction, the transferee leaves the group of which it and the transferor were members and it, or a relevant associated company, holds the land that was transferred intra-group (Finance Act 2003, Sch 7, para 3).

# Auction Sale

Two main routes to sale:

1. Bilateral transaction
2. Auction sale.

## Auction Pros and Cons

### Seller Advantages

- Larger pool of investors
- Price maximisation through competition
- Better terms potentially secured – bidders are likely to keep their amendments of the sale documents to a minimum.
- Seller controls DD
- Seller can control the transaction timetable
- Can assist directors in demonstrating that the best price has been obtained.

### Seller Disadvantages

- Not all businesses suitable for sale by auction – depends on the size of the market
- Could be inappropriate where target structure is complicated/ where there are significant regulatory/ competition issues.
- Sellers' transaction costs higher (legal + banking fees)
- Significant management time commitment
- Knowledge that business is for sale may disrupt business
- Some bidders may only want to find out about the competition.
- Auction failure is public
- Additional legal concerns

### Bidder Concerns

- May be forced to pay a higher price
- Presence of other bidders reduces chances of concluding a successful deal
- Bidders receive more limited DD
- Warranties, indemnities and contractual protections lower than on bilateral sale.
- Less opportunity to for bidder to build relationships with target's management
- Greater risk of damage to target's business – if news of the sale gets out.

Bidder attempts to be selected as the preferred bidder and negotiate an exclusivity period. Bidder then tries to redress the balance towards its interests. Not possible to “lock in” a seller.

Bidders can improve chances through:

- Price
- Certainty of funds
- Following the timeline.

## Seller's Preparations

Before contacting prospective bidders, seller will engage advisers, carry out internal due diligence and prepare transaction documents.

### Deal Team

The seller should agree each member's responsibilities at an early stage.

Financial adviser has the role of:

- Soliciting bidders
- Preparing marketing
- Handling requests for access to management
- Handling DD, questions, price negotiation.

### Finding Bidders

Financial adviser will contact a wide range of financial and strategic buyers to gauge interest. Consider:

- Competition risk assessment – competition authorities may impose onerous conditions on sale.
- Transaction approvals – need for shareholder approval, investment approval or exchange control consent.
- Buyer financing – suitable assurances of full commitment of source financing from bidders financing with new debt/ equity.
- Employee consultation – may be required before completion of transaction
- Post-completion operations – seller anticipating bidders' concerns about the target's ability to operate independently.
- Transaction structure – bidders may prefer a different sale structure.
- Level of interest – beware of bidders on fishing expeditions
- Sanctions and anti-corruption issues.

### Seller Due Diligence

Internal due diligence carried out to identify potential problems before the auction is launched. It will help the seller produce an accurate information memorandum. Enables seller's disclosure letter to be prepared and sent to potential bidders.

#### Due Diligence Reports

Common for the seller's advisers to prepare a vendor due diligence report (VDD/ VDDR). These are relied on by a successful buyer. Principal purpose: to minimise the time bidders need to spend carrying out their own due diligence investigation.

More likely to be commissioned on large transactions. Financial VDD reports usually issued, and then legal/ tax/ property/ commercial sometimes issued.

Type of VDD report varies by transaction. VDD reports are initially given to potential bidders on a non-reliance basis, but on the understanding that the reports will be addressed to the successful bidder, who can then rely on them in the same way that they rely on the bidder's own due diligence reports.

Bidders are made to sign a non-reliance letter, which also excludes liability for mistakes and omissions.

The successful bidder receives a copy of the final VDD reports and is permitted to rely on them, subject to certain negotiated limitations, such as a cap on liability. The bidder's lenders and other third parties may also be permitted to rely on the final reports, on and subject to the terms set out in a reliance letter to be signed by each of them.

#### Data Room

Data room enables the seller to ensure equal access to information by all bidders.

Decisions will have to be taken on how to deal with, for example, sensitive agreements and claims. While in some cases it may be sufficient to provide summaries or to redact the sensitive parts of key contracts, alternatives include having an independent report prepared by the seller's lawyers summarising the target's contractual arrangements with suitable anonymity, or holding back key agreements until a later stage in the auction process.

The _[legal professional privilege](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/4-107-6756?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=e6c4099f36904665b8e4b53211f9bb58)_ implications need to be borne in mind before written reports are provided to bidders about actual/ pending litigation.

Sellers should also bear in mind that the treatment of the contents of the data room could be a contentious issue when negotiating the seller's warranties and related disclosures with the successful bidder. It is usual practice for the seller's draft sale and purchase agreement to state that all information in the data room is "disclosed" and qualifies the seller's warranties accordingly.

Physical data rooms rare.

### Transaction Documents

Usually include:

- Confidentiality agreement
	- Bidders prevented from speaking to one another (to stop collusion)
	- Agreement often sent out with a “teaser” document describing the target business and a few key attributes.
	- In a share sale, where the target is not a party to the confidentiality agreement, there will be a clause giving it the benefit of rights and right to enforce prospective bidders obligations under Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
- Information memorandum
	- Marketing document intended to provide prospective bidders with reasonable information about the target.
	- Contains a description of the target, financial information + projections, management + employee details, potentially customers and contracts.
	- Disclaimer that no representations or warranties are made about the information in it. Successful bidder may try to include express warranties in the sale agreement concerning the IM's contents.
- Bid process letter
	- Explains auction rules and procedure.
	- Expected number of bidding rounds, due dates, DD process, disclaimers and reservation rights.
	- What each bidder must include in their indicative offers.
	- Will often state that the highest price will not necessarily succeed to retain flexibility for the seller.
	- While English law does not recognise a more general duty of good faith which might prevent the seller's withdrawal (_[Walford v Miles [1992] 2 AC 128](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-009-7961?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=e6c4099f36904665b8e4b53211f9bb58)_), the bid process letter should always expressly reserve its right to amend or discontinue the auction process at any time.
- Data room rules and protocols
- SPA
	- Controlling the preparation of the first draft of the sale and purchase agreement can give the seller a substantial negotiation advantage.
	- Bidder may accept only minor amendments due to the competitive pressure.
	- But the first draft should still be reasonable, so sellers do not feel justified making major changes.
	- Seller should set out the scope of warranties and any applicable qualifications.
	- Seller may draft warranties on the basis that they will be insured.
	- Usually provided to bidders ~ 1 week after they have reviewed data room documents.
- Ancillary transaction documents.

## Other Considerations

### Staff

- The process may have an impact on staff morale, so special bonuses are sometimes offered (but for a public company, take care these do not infringe s 678 CA 2006 financial assistance rules).
- Seller will try to limit the number of staff who know of the sale. Site visits etc. should be discreetly handled.

### Management as Bidders

If management are potential buyers, important to ensure their cooperation is managed through the auction in case there is a conflict of interest. Required to deliver a certificate that relevant information and documents have been disclosed.

### W&I Insurance

Increasingly prevalent; useful in auction sales in helping the seller to reduce its exposure to claims under transaction warranties.

Advantages:

- Helpful if a bidder requires additional coverage in excess of the cap on seller's liability set out in the draft SPA.
- Can reduce the need for the seller to place funds in escrow for potential warranty claims.
- Bidders can accept a lower cap on the seller's liability for warranty breaches, making their bids more attractive.

### Key Stages

- Invitation to bid
- Confidentiality undertaking obtained from prospective bidders
- Distribution of an information memorandum
	- Usually with bid process letter
- First round indicative bidding
	- Intended to eliminate non-serious participants.
	- Interested parties required to submit non-binding offers for the target.
	- First round bids necessarily based on very little information.
	- Seller's financial adviser collates bids and reviews these with the seller.
- Bidder due diligence
	- Access to data room, meetings with management and site visits permitted for shortlisted bidders.
	- Meetings with each bidder usually arranged individually.
	- Bidder site visits supervised.
- Preparation of transaction documents.
- Submit + evaluate final bids
	- Bidders submit best and final offers for the target.
	- Final price, details of any conditions, mark-up of transaction documents.
- Select preferred bidder and finalise SPA
	- Seller will consider degree of conditionality attaching to bids, price, proposed amendments to draft documents, bidder track record, risk bidder is prepared to assume, whether further DD is required.
	- From a tactical perspective, a bidder may try to avoid being drawn too far on the detail of the transaction documents by reserving its position on certain issues pending additional due diligence.
	- Before deciding on the preferred bidder, the seller will often try once more to play the remaining bidders off against each other.
	- Occasionally, the seller may continue to run parallel negotiations with its second-choice bidder, with a view to maximising competitive tension and ensuring it has a reserve position.
	- While obtaining exclusivity may give the bidder some comfort that the seller will not negotiate or complete a transaction with another party for the specified exclusivity period, any agreement to negotiate and continue to negotiate with the buyer will not be enforceable.
	- It is common for the seller to be permitted to break the exclusivity period if the bidder departs in any material respect from the terms of its offer.
	- There will sometimes be a right for one party to recover their costs through _[break fees](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/3-107-6511?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=dab127673f7d412295221d0e3567ba14)_ from the other should the transaction not happen.
- Final negotiations and completion
	- essential to maintain momentum in the sale process following selection of a preferred bidder.
	- Once the sale and purchase agreement and other transaction documents have been agreed, exchange and completion of an auction transaction proceeds in much the same way as a typical bilateral transaction.

Typically, auction runs a few weeks/ months.

## Legal Considerations

### Financial Promotions

Distribution of IM to potential bidders will usually constitute a financial promotion. s 21 FSMA: it is a criminal offence for an unauthorised person to, in the course of business, communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (that is, make or issue a financial promotion) unless its contents have been approved by an authorised person, or a relevant exemption applies.

Some of the more commonly used exemptions in the context of a share sale include:

- Promotions made to investment professionals, high net worth companies, certified high net worth individuals and sophisticated investors (articles 19, 48, 49 and 50, FPO).
- Sale of a body corporate (article 62, FPO).
- One-off, non-real time communications which are tailored to the recipient's circumstances (article 28, FPO).

Sanction: fine or up to two years' imprisonment, or both.

### Criminal Liability for Misleading Statements and Market Manipulation

If the transaction involves the sale and purchase of shares in a target company, when preparing the IM, the seller and its advisers will need to bear in mind the potential for liability under FSA 2012 for making or false or misleading statements, or creating false or misleading impressions.

- s 89 FSA 2012: false or misleading statements
- s 90 FSA 2012: market manipulation

The offences under _[sections 89](https://uk.westlaw.com/7-523-3717?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ or _[90](https://uk.westlaw.com/5-523-3718?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ of the FSA 2012 are punishable by imprisonment or a fine (or both) (_[section 92](https://uk.westlaw.com/1-523-3720?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d), FSA 2012_).

### FSMA Regulated Activity

Section 19 provides that a person must not carry on a regulated activity in the UK, or purport to do so, unless they are an authorised or exempt person. See

![[Regulated activity flowchart.png]]

#### Four Tests

s 22 FSMA 2000 sets out the definition of a regulated activity, which has been substantially amended by FSA 2012.

> [!test] Is an activity regulated?
> Tests:
> 1. Are you in business?
> 2. Is there a specified activity?
> 3. Is there a specified investment, or does the specified actifvitiy relate to information about a person's financial standing or administering a benchmark?

> [!note]
> RAO 2001 is shorthand for Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001, SI 2001/544

- Particular activities and investments are specified by the Treasure in RAO 2001, s 22.
- Information about a person's financial standing includes credit references and stuff
- 'Benchmark' is defined in s 22(6A) FSMA 2000.

### Prospectus Requirements

The seller will be required to issue an approved _[prospectus](https://uk.westlaw.com/5-107-7072?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ complying with _[FSMA](https://uk.westlaw.com/5-505-5867?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ and the and the retained EU law version of the Prospectus Regulation if there is an offer of transferable securities to the public.

### Managing Bid Process

- Beware of fraudulent misrepresentation (overstating the bidding interest to another bidding party.
- Seller must be careful about the extent to which it can disregard bids. [[Blackpool & Fylde Aero Club Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council [1990] 1 WLR 1195]] – Court of Appeal decided that where a tenderer submitted a conforming tender before the deadline, it was entitled “not as a matter of mere expectation, but of contractual right” to have its tender considered along with all other conforming tender.
- Both seller and bidder alike will be anxious to avoid creating a binding contract at any point through the auction process until the sale and purchase agreement has been agreed and exchanged.
