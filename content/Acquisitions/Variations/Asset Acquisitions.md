# Asset Acquisitions

## Agreeing What to Transfer

Consider an asset acquisition where the buyer's objective is to continue to run the target business after its acquisition, either as a stand-alone business or by incorporation of the acquired assets.

### Common Law Approach

Terms of the acquisition set out in the SPA, possibly with further details in the schedules. Usual to include a definition of the “business” of the target, together with provisions dealing with the transfer of goodwill. Parties will often include a list of assets specifically excluded (usually including cash, debtors, creditors).

In E&W, on an asset acquisition, each asset/ liability must be specifically identified and individually transferred in the manner required for the particular asset/ liability. Exception: certain employment obligations and environmental liabilities which transfer with the land.

US asset acquisition requires compliance with applicable bulk sales statutes. Enacted by the majority of US states to protect the buyer in an asset acquisition. To protect the buyer from claims by the seller's creditors, the seller must complete a list (usually be affidavit) of existing creditors.

Bulk sale statutes generally require that each of the creditors is given notice a certain period before the transfer of the business takes place. If the registration process is not completed by a buyer, creditors of the seller may obtain a declaration that the sale was invalid as against them and repossess goods.

### Timing

SPA should specify timing of the completion of an asset acquisition. Usually specifies that the transfer of all required assets will take place simultaneously at completion. Sometimes a formal transfer of assets at completion is not possible (e.g., if consent to the transfer is required). Then the SPA usually provides that the seller will hold the asset on trust for the benefit of the buyer pending the formal transfer (but able to use it for the purposes of business in the meantime).

An “effective time” of transfer may be specified (in large multi-jurisdictional transfers).

## Transfer of Assets

### Contracts

#### Passing Benefit and Burden

The buyer should ensure it receives the benefit of all contracts entered into between the seller and 3rd parties, which are important to enable the business to continue trading after the completion of the acquisition.

Under English law, can do this by assigning the benefit of the contract. If legal assignment is required, notice must be given to the other contracting party (s 136 LPA 1925). This is desirable – otherwise the 3rd party can continue making payments to the seller.

```ad-warning
This method only transfers the benefit of the contract, so the seller will still be liable to the 3rd party for any outstanding obligations.
```

```ad-example
In an exclusive distribution agreement, if the seller is the distributor, the benefit under the agreement is the receipt of goods for resale in a given territory; the burden is payment for the goods. Under English law, the right to receive the goods can be legally assigned by giving notice under s 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (unless the contract says consent is required), but the obligation to pay for the goods remains with the seller.
```

To get around this, the existing contract can be **novated**. Involves the other party to the contract agreeing to release the seller from the contract, allowing the buyer to take over the benefit and burden. The parties to the novation agreement will be the buyer, the seller and the 3rd party.

```ad-note
Because this involves the cooperation of the third party, can be time-consuming. 
```

### Debtors and Creditors

Sums owed to the seller by third parties (debtors) are an asset of the business; sums owed by the seller to third parties (creditors) are a liability of the business.

#### Transfer to Buyer

In E&W, the debtors and creditors may be transferred to the buyer. Full details should be included in a schedule or appendix to SPA. For the assignment of debts to be a legal assignment (not an equitable one), s 136 LPA 1925 requires written notice of the assignment to be given to each debtor.

Seller will remain liable to its creditors after completion, unless creditors agree to release it. So when parties have agreed to transfer creditors, the seller should seek an indemnity from the buyer against such liability.

But it can be tricky to transfer debtors and creditors:

- Complications of accurately defining the debts and liabilities involved
- Must give notice to all creditors
- Difficult to value book debts

The seller may be prepared to warrant that the debts are fully recoverable.

#### Retention by Seller

Possible for debtors and creditors to remain with the seller. Buyer will be keen to preserve goodwill of the ongoing business. So will want the seller to pay creditors promptly and not be too wild in chasing debtors. Buyer may insist on a retention from the purchase price to be released once creditors have been paid. Should consider getting an undertaking from the seller not to issue proceed debt recovery proceeding for a specified period/ give the buyer the option to buy debts from the seller at the end of this period.

But the seller may no longer have means to collect the debts after completion (e.g., if its employees have been transferred to the buyer). So often the buyer agrees to collect debts as the agent of the seller. The buyer will be required to use reasonable endeavours to collect the debts without being obliged to commence legal proceedings.

SPA should specify what happens to sums received by the buyer after completion, in respect of business conducted before completion.
