# Private Equity

## Overview

- Investment in the share capital of a private company
- Provision of finance to new developing businesses/ underperforming companies (both private and public).
- Lightly regulated; conflicts of interest and over-leveraging.
- The EU has passed the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (2011/61/EU), which was implemented in the UK by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/1773) (AIFMR 2013) which came into force on 22 July 2013.
- Implements a harmonised regulatory framework across the EU for EU-established managers of alternative investment funds (AIFMs)
	- Must be authorised
	- Adherence to strict capital requirements
	- Systems for managing risk, liquidity and conflicts
	- Disclosures
- Managing an alternative investment fund is a regulated activity (RAO 2001)

### Provider

- Specialist PE funds created whereby the investors agree to form a limited partnership to provide funds to be invested.
- Legislative Reform (Private Fund Limited Partnerships) Order 2017 created “private fund limited partnerships”, which have simplified regulation.
- Fund will have a statement about the investments it can and cannot make.
- Allocation is a decision made by a PE provider (i.e., PE house/ PE fund manager).
	- PE fund delegates investment management duties to the PE fund manager, benefitting from expertise.
	- PE provider makes profits through making and managing and divesting investments. Receives fees for doing so.
	- Typically, there is an annual management fee and performance fee (commonly 2/20)
- Investors in PE fund make profit primarily through capital growth.

### Decision to Invest

PE provider will follow an agreed internal procedure for approving an investment. This can impact the timetable of an investment. Typically:

1. Investment paper presented to an investment committee
2. Acquisition offer made on the basis of the initial approval.
3. Investment of funds provided through corporate investment structures.
4. Often there are layered structures (“structural subordination”) in tax-efficient jurisdictions.

### Types of Investments

Broadly 3 categories of PE investments:

1. Start-up capital
2. Development capital
3. Buyouts.

For (1) and (2), the investment is usually a subscription for shares in the existing company. For (3), depends (e.g., management buyout, institutional leveraged buyout).

The method chosen depends both on the type and size of the buyout.

| Type of buyout                 | Method of investment                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small management buyout        | Direct subscription of shares                             |
| Large management buyout        | Lots of debt finance, corporate structure may be created. |
| Institutional leveraged buyout | Complex corporate structure.                                                           |

## Management Buyout

> [!defn] "MBO"
> A transaction by which the target is acquired by some or all of its management, usually through the vehicle of a new company established for this purpose (‘Newco’).

- May proceed as share or asset acquisitions
- Usually requires external funding – a business plan is drawn up to seek PE funding.
- Often several PE providers invited to bid.
- Financing is a mix of equity finance from the management team and PE provider, and debt finance secured on the assets of the target.
- In a management buyout instigated by existing management, PE provider expects the management team to provide a substantial investment to ensure the team is committed financially.
- PE provider usually takes a majority shareholding, but may accept a minority if it has the option of taking more control.

### Investment

Investment made through a new corporate vehicle (Newco). PE provider and management team subscribe for ordinary shares in Newco, though rights are carefully negotiated.

PE provider gets some redeemable preference shares carrying preferential rights to receive income by dividends and return of capital on a winding up of Newco.

Parties to the venture enter into an Investment Agreement. Sets out the basis of investment, any required restrictions, and relevant provisions. Traditional MBO: the investment agreement also includes extensive warranties about the target business and the business plan drawn up by the team. Sometimes the PE provider insists on the management team also warranting key information.

### Conflicts of Interest

> [!warning]
> Take care to ensure the actions of the management team do not breach any obligations of good faith or confidentiality to the target. 

1. Management team wants to get the best price
2. But they also owe duties to the company and its shareholders and employees.

> [!action]
> Upon deciding to initiate an MBO, approach the board to declare the director's interest and seek consent to proceed.

#### Consideration

Under English law, management buyouts may also give rise to consideration of s 190 of the CA 2006 and the need for shareholders’ approval where a company buys an asset from or sells an asset to a director.

If the director will hold shares in the corporate vehicle created for the purpose of the buyout (Newco) then this could fall within the classification of a company ‘connected’ with the director under s 254 CA 2006. Although a single director is unlikely to hold the relevant 20% holding required for Newco to be a company connected with the director under s 254(2), the legislation refers to a 20% holding by a director and/or the director’s connected persons. So might need shareholder approval under s 190 (SPT).

### Warranties

Another feature of MBO transactions is warranty provision. More negotiation than a traditional asset or share sale. Seller likely to resist extensive warranties included in the SPA on the basis that the managers buying the target are likely to know more than the shareholders. But remember, warranties are about risk allocation and discovery.

## Institutional Leveraged Buyouts

PE provider hoping to acquire a majority shareholding in a private company with the potential to generate substantial profits. PE provider managing funds created by institutional investors. Often there are multiple PE providers bidding for the right to acquire the company.

### Debt/ Equity Ratio

Ratio is a commercial question. Consider the internal rate of return; the lower the amount of equity, the greater the gains per share. Often there is lots and lots of debt (especially since debt was cheap until recently).

> [!important]
> Private companies are not subject to prohibitions on financial assistance. So any borrowing for the acquisition of target's shares can be secured on the assets of target. Where a public company is acquired by a PE fund, the public target is first immediately converted to a private company (to allow this to happen). 

### Management Team

#### Leveraged Buyout

Often a mix of the existing managers and external managers brought in by the PE provider. Provided with a financial incentive – usually through a class of equity shares called “sweet equity”. Management can sell this when the target is sold.

Management team expected to give warranties in relation to its business plan and information about the target. Usually driven by a concern to establish the management team's full commitment to the process (rather than risk allocation). Sellers usually provide full warranties and claims made against sellers.

### Common Structures

To accommodate varying interests and maximise security/ tax planning, the PE provider will not invest directly into the acquired company. Corporate structure used.

1. Holding/ top company acting as the investment vehicle.
2. Wholly owned subsidiary A which undertakes the bank borrowing needed to provide the balance of the acquisition cost.
3. Actual purchase of the target made by subsidiary A or its subsidiary, subsidiary B

The companies undertaking the debt finance and the purchase of the target company will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of the top company. The equity investment is placed in the top company, which will be responsible for overseeing the operation of the investment, as governed by the terms of the investment agreement and by appropriate provisions in its articles.

## Key Documentation

3 key parties to any buyout:

1. PE provider
2. Debt financiers
3. Management team.

Each has their own aims and objectives, and seek to manage the risks they agree to take on as part of the buyout, through:

1. Corporate buyout structure
2. Terms of documentation governing investment
3. Rights attaching to equity shares acquired.

### Investment Agreement

Contractual document setting out the agreed terms of the proposed investment, ongoing management of the target, and terms of any proposed realisation.

Terms take precedence over any other documentation required (e.g., loan agreements, service contracts) – and explicitly states this.

Intended primarily to cover the terms of the equity investment, but debt finance providers often also party to it. On a management buyout, the providers of debt finance will enter the facility agreements setting out the terms on which they are prepared to loan the required funds and the terms of any charges/ security.

On larger leveraged buy-outs, in addition to simple loans the debt providers may also provide debt with an option to convert into equity, or even a level of debt which is unsecured.

#### Terms of the Investment

Specifies how the money required for the proposed purchase will be raised. Includes how much money is invested by the PE provider and management team, as well as the proportion raised by borrowing.

PE investor:

- Small proportion of ordinary shares
- Remainder in preference shares.
- Occasionally debt securities.

Details of proposed acquisition, including conditions precedent to the transaction. So various parties all sign the investment agreement, but each party becomes committed to making its investment and proceeding with the acquisition only once other parties have made respective investments.

Management warranties expected on a traditional MBO, and also on an institutional leveraged buyout if the existing management are given the opportunity to take an equity stake.

#### Governance

Investment agreement sets out the agreed structures for the ongoing management of the target. Depends on whether the PE provider has taken a majority stake.

If PE provider has a minority stake, the provider will want strict restrictions on the activities of the target. If it already has a majority, doesn't care so much (already has control).

Institutional leveraged buyout: provider will require a majority stake and will require provisions to monitor the investment and take control of the top company/ subsidiaries if needed.

Restrictions imposed vary with each transaction. The agreement may provide for

- the right to appoint/ dismiss board members,
- right to obtain information, and
- right to veto certain decisions.

Restrictions reflected in the articles of the top company and expressed as rights attaching to a particular class of shares.

#### Realisation of Investment

The investment agreement will usually include provisions relating to the intended realisation of the investment – usually a 5-year horizon. A listing is the most desirable outcome for the PE provider. Documentation will provide for the conversion of a particular class of shares into ordinary shares prior to the shares being admitted to trading. Otherwise, a sale to another PE provider/ a trade sale may occur.

##### Warranties

Buyer will expect the seller to provide warranties about the company. But a PE provider will not be prepared to give such warranties, as the money it realises from the investment must be returned to the private equity funds and cannot be subject to a possible later charge. So the investment agreement will include words to this effect.

##### Transfer of Shares

The investment agreement also includes agreed forms of the constitution of the company in which the investment is taking place. Usually prohibits the transfer of shares by the management team, except for mandatory sale if the director leaves (dismissal/ retirement/ death). Price paid for shares depends on if the manager is a “good” or “bad” leaver. On a traditional MBO, provisions heavily negotiated.

The agreed constitution also includes provisions relating to the **permitted** transfer of shares (drag along/ tag along provisions).

- Drag along provision imposed on any minority management shareholders.
	- Enables PE provider to force minority shareholders to sell their shares when realising investment.
- Tag along
	- Minority shareholder allowed to join in any sale of shares where an offer has been made to the private equity provider.

### Associated Documentation

#### Investment

- The parties to the transaction must agree the terms of the constitution of the top company. Sets out the agreed class rights of each type of share to be issued.
- The constitution includes any agreed restrictions on the transfer of shares and provisions regarding mandatory sales where a manager is dismissed or offer for shares received.
- The managers will be employees of the top company, and the terms of their service contracts must be negotiated.

#### Debt Finance

- The bank may be a party to the investment agreement on an institutional buyout if it is subscribing for debt securities that can be converted into equity securities.
- There is separate banking documentation to govern the provision of debt finance. This usually includes a bank facility agreement specifying the amount of money lent.
- The bank requires a package of documentation detailing the security over assets of the target.
- Also an inter-creditor agreement setting out an agreed order of priority.

#### Acquisition

The acquisition process is the same as on a trade acquisition, but the focus is on investment potential. Many PE deals progress by structured auction, where the seller controls the process and summarises due diligence.

Buyer-led due diligence can be problematic (especially for warranty provision), if the management comprises existing managers. Common for investors to take out warranty and indemnity insurance to cover an element of the risk inherent in private equity transactions. The buyer and seller then enter an SPA as normal.
