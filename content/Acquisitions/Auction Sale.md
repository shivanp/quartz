# Auction Sale

Two main routes to sale:

1. Bilateral transaction
2. Auction sale.

## Auction Pros and Cons

### Seller Advantages

- Larger pool of investors
- Price maximisation through competition
- Better terms potentially secured – bidders are likely to keep their amendments of the sale documents to a minimum.
- Seller controls DD
- Seller can control the transaction timetable
- Can assist directors in demonstrating that the best price has been obtained.

### Seller Disadvantages

- Not all businesses suitable for sale by auction – depends on the size of the market
- Could be inappropriate where target structure is complicated/ where there are significant regulatory/ competition issues.
- Sellers' transaction costs higher (legal + banking fees)
- Significant management time commitment
- Knowledge that business is for sale may disrupt business
- Some bidders may only want to find out about the competition.
- Auction failure is public
- Additional legal concerns

### Bidder Concerns

- May be forced to pay a higher price
- Presence of other bidders reduces chances of concluding a successful deal
- Bidders receive more limited DD
- Warranties, indemnities and contractual protections lower than on bilateral sale.
- Less opportunity to for bidder to build relationships with target's management
- Greater risk of damage to target's business – if news of the sale gets out.

Bidder attempts to be selected as the preferred bidder and negotiate an exclusivity period. Bidder then tries to redress the balance towards its interests. Not possible to “lock in” a seller.

Bidders can improve chances through:

- Price
- Certainty of funds
- Following the timeline.

## Seller's Preparations

Before contacting prospective bidders, seller will engage advisers, carry out internal due diligence and prepare transaction documents.

### Deal Team

The seller should agree each member's responsibilities at an early stage.

Financial adviser has the role of:

- Soliciting bidders
- Preparing marketing
- Handling requests for access to management
- Handling DD, questions, price negotiation.

### Finding Bidders

Financial adviser will contact a wide range of financial and strategic buyers to gauge interest. Consider:

- Competition risk assessment – competition authorities may impose onerous conditions on sale.
- Transaction approvals – need for shareholder approval, investment approval or exchange control consent.
- Buyer financing – suitable assurances of full commitment of source financing from bidders financing with new debt/ equity.
- Employee consultation – may be required before completion of transaction
- Post-completion operations – seller anticipating bidders' concerns about the target's ability to operate independently.
- Transaction structure – bidders may prefer a different sale structure.
- Level of interest – beware of bidders on fishing expeditions
- Sanctions and anti-corruption issues.

### Seller Due Diligence

Internal due diligence carried out to identify potential problems before the auction is launched. It will help the seller produce an accurate information memorandum. Enables seller's disclosure letter to be prepared and sent to potential bidders.

#### Due Diligence Reports

Common for the seller's advisers to prepare a vendor due diligence report (VDD/ VDDR). These are relied on by a successful buyer. Principal purpose: to minimise the time bidders need to spend carrying out their own due diligence investigation.

More likely to be commissioned on large transactions. Financial VDD reports usually issued, and then legal/ tax/ property/ commercial sometimes issued.

Type of VDD report varies by transaction. VDD reports are initially given to potential bidders on a non-reliance basis, but on the understanding that the reports will be addressed to the successful bidder, who can then rely on them in the same way that they rely on the bidder's own due diligence reports.

Bidders are made to sign a non-reliance letter, which also excludes liability for mistakes and omissions.

The successful bidder receives a copy of the final VDD reports and is permitted to rely on them, subject to certain negotiated limitations, such as a cap on liability. The bidder's lenders and other third parties may also be permitted to rely on the final reports, on and subject to the terms set out in a reliance letter to be signed by each of them.

#### Data Room

Data room enables the seller to ensure equal access to information by all bidders.

Decisions will have to be taken on how to deal with, for example, sensitive agreements and claims. While in some cases it may be sufficient to provide summaries or to redact the sensitive parts of key contracts, alternatives include having an independent report prepared by the seller's lawyers summarising the target's contractual arrangements with suitable anonymity, or holding back key agreements until a later stage in the auction process.

The _[legal professional privilege](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/4-107-6756?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=e6c4099f36904665b8e4b53211f9bb58)_ implications need to be borne in mind before written reports are provided to bidders about actual/ pending litigation.

Sellers should also bear in mind that the treatment of the contents of the data room could be a contentious issue when negotiating the seller's warranties and related disclosures with the successful bidder. It is usual practice for the seller's draft sale and purchase agreement to state that all information in the data room is "disclosed" and qualifies the seller's warranties accordingly.

Physical data rooms rare.

### Transaction Documents

Usually include:

- Confidentiality agreement
	- Bidders prevented from speaking to one another (to stop collusion)
	- Agreement often sent out with a “teaser” document describing the target business and a few key attributes.
	- In a share sale, where the target is not a party to the confidentiality agreement, there will be a clause giving it the benefit of rights and right to enforce prospective bidders obligations under Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.
- Information memorandum
	- Marketing document intended to provide prospective bidders with reasonable information about the target.
	- Contains a description of the target, financial information + projections, management + employee details, potentially customers and contracts.
	- Disclaimer that no representations or warranties are made about the information in it. Successful bidder may try to include express warranties in the sale agreement concerning the IM's contents.
- Bid process letter
	- Explains auction rules and procedure.
	- Expected number of bidding rounds, due dates, DD process, disclaimers and reservation rights.
	- What each bidder must include in their indicative offers.
	- Will often state that the highest price will not necessarily succeed to retain flexibility for the seller.
	- While English law does not recognise a more general duty of good faith which might prevent the seller's withdrawal (_[Walford v Miles [1992] 2 AC 128](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-009-7961?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=e6c4099f36904665b8e4b53211f9bb58)_), the bid process letter should always expressly reserve its right to amend or discontinue the auction process at any time.
- Data room rules and protocols
- SPA
	- Controlling the preparation of the first draft of the sale and purchase agreement can give the seller a substantial negotiation advantage.
	- Bidder may accept only minor amendments due to the competitive pressure.
	- But the first draft should still be reasonable, so sellers do not feel justified making major changes.
	- Seller should set out the scope of warranties and any applicable qualifications.
	- Seller may draft warranties on the basis that they will be insured.
	- Usually provided to bidders ~ 1 week after they have reviewed data room documents.
- Ancillary transaction documents.

## Other Considerations

### Staff

- The process may have an impact on staff morale, so special bonuses are sometimes offered (but for a public company, take care these do not infringe s 678 CA 2006 financial assistance rules).
- Seller will try to limit the number of staff who know of the sale. Site visits etc. should be discreetly handled.

### Management as Bidders

If management are potential buyers, important to ensure their cooperation is managed through the auction in case there is a conflict of interest. Required to deliver a certificate that relevant information and documents have been disclosed.

### W&I Insurance

Increasingly prevalent; useful in auction sales in helping the seller to reduce its exposure to claims under transaction warranties.

Advantages:

- Helpful if a bidder requires additional coverage in excess of the cap on seller's liability set out in the draft SPA.
- Can reduce the need for the seller to place funds in escrow for potential warranty claims.
- Bidders can accept a lower cap on the seller's liability for warranty breaches, making their bids more attractive.

### Key Stages

- Invitation to bid
- Confidentiality undertaking obtained from prospective bidders
- Distribution of an information memorandum
	- Usually with bid process letter
- First round indicative bidding
	- Intended to eliminate non-serious participants.
	- Interested parties required to submit non-binding offers for the target.
	- First round bids necessarily based on very little information.
	- Seller's financial adviser collates bids and reviews these with the seller.
- Bidder due diligence
	- Access to data room, meetings with management and site visits permitted for shortlisted bidders.
	- Meetings with each bidder usually arranged individually.
	- Bidder site visits supervised.
- Preparation of transaction documents.
- Submit + evaluate final bids
	- Bidders submit best and final offers for the target.
	- Final price, details of any conditions, mark-up of transaction documents.
- Select preferred bidder and finalise SPA
	- Seller will consider degree of conditionality attaching to bids, price, proposed amendments to draft documents, bidder track record, risk bidder is prepared to assume, whether further DD is required.
	- From a tactical perspective, a bidder may try to avoid being drawn too far on the detail of the transaction documents by reserving its position on certain issues pending additional due diligence.
	- Before deciding on the preferred bidder, the seller will often try once more to play the remaining bidders off against each other.
	- Occasionally, the seller may continue to run parallel negotiations with its second-choice bidder, with a view to maximising competitive tension and ensuring it has a reserve position.
	- While obtaining exclusivity may give the bidder some comfort that the seller will not negotiate or complete a transaction with another party for the specified exclusivity period, any agreement to negotiate and continue to negotiate with the buyer will not be enforceable.
	- It is common for the seller to be permitted to break the exclusivity period if the bidder departs in any material respect from the terms of its offer.
	- There will sometimes be a right for one party to recover their costs through _[break fees](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/3-107-6511?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=dab127673f7d412295221d0e3567ba14)_ from the other should the transaction not happen.
- Final negotiations and completion
	- essential to maintain momentum in the sale process following selection of a preferred bidder.
	- Once the sale and purchase agreement and other transaction documents have been agreed, exchange and completion of an auction transaction proceeds in much the same way as a typical bilateral transaction.

Typically, auction runs a few weeks/ months.

## Legal Considerations

### Financial Promotions

Distribution of IM to potential bidders will usually constitute a financial promotion. s 21 FSMA: it is a criminal offence for an unauthorised person to, in the course of business, communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (that is, make or issue a financial promotion) unless its contents have been approved by an authorised person, or a relevant exemption applies.

Some of the more commonly used exemptions in the context of a share sale include:

- Promotions made to investment professionals, high net worth companies, certified high net worth individuals and sophisticated investors (articles 19, 48, 49 and 50, FPO).
- Sale of a body corporate (article 62, FPO).
- One-off, non-real time communications which are tailored to the recipient's circumstances (article 28, FPO).

Sanction: fine or up to two years' imprisonment, or both.

### Criminal Liability for Misleading Statements and Market Manipulation

If the transaction involves the sale and purchase of shares in a target company, when preparing the IM, the seller and its advisers will need to bear in mind the potential for liability under FSA 2012 for making or false or misleading statements, or creating false or misleading impressions.

- s 89 FSA 2012: false or misleading statements
- s 90 FSA 2012: market manipulation

The offences under _[sections 89](https://uk.westlaw.com/7-523-3717?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ or _[90](https://uk.westlaw.com/5-523-3718?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ of the FSA 2012 are punishable by imprisonment or a fine (or both) (_[section 92](https://uk.westlaw.com/1-523-3720?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d), FSA 2012_).

### FSMA Regulated Activity

Section 19 provides that a person must not carry on a regulated activity in the UK, or purport to do so, unless they are an authorised or exempt person. See ![[Financial Services#Regulated Activity]]

### Prospectus Requirements

The seller will be required to issue an approved _[prospectus](https://uk.westlaw.com/5-107-7072?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ complying with _[FSMA](https://uk.westlaw.com/5-505-5867?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=287b073fbf064422aba9bab6fbc11f1d)_ and the and the retained EU law version of the Prospectus Regulation if there is an offer of transferable securities to the public.

### Managing Bid Process

- Beware of fraudulent misrepresentation (overstating the bidding interest to another bidding party.
- Seller must be careful about the extent to which it can disregard bids. [[Blackpool & Fylde Aero Club Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council [1990] 1 WLR 1195]] – Court of Appeal decided that where a tenderer submitted a conforming tender before the deadline, it was entitled “not as a matter of mere expectation, but of contractual right” to have its tender considered along with all other conforming tender.
- Both seller and bidder alike will be anxious to avoid creating a binding contract at any point through the auction process until the sale and purchase agreement has been agreed and exchanged.
