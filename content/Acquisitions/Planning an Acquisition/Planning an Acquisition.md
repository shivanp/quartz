# Acquisition Types

## Introduction

Aims in an acquisition:

| Party  | Aims                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Buyer  | Acquiring exactly what it wants for the best possible price. |
| Seller | Minimising continuing obligations while aiming for highest realistic price.                                                              |

Most jurisdictions have at least two forms of corporate vehicle.

| Jurisdiction | Private companies | Public companies |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| UK           | Limited           | plc              |
| Germany      | GmbH              | AG               |
| France       | SARL              | SA/ SCA                 |

There are additional rules for acquisitions involving public companies:

- In England, public company share acquisitions have to follow a formal offer process
	- All shareholders issued with an offer document setting out terms
	- Governed by City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
	- Also applies if a scheme of arrangement is used to effect a merger.
- If a party is listed, Stock Exchange Listing Rules additionally apply.

```ad-defn
title: Asset acquisition
Involves the buyer acquiring the assets making up the business. Contract between the byer and the owner of the assets of the business. Could include tangible assets (land, machinery, stock) and intangible assets (IP, goodwill). 
```

```ad-defn
title: Share acquisition
Buyer acquires the shares in the company operating and owning the business. Contract between buyer and shareholder(s). No change in the ownership of the business - the business itself is still owned by the company. 
```

## Choice of Acquisition

- The owners of a company will often prefer to sell their shares
- Buyer will often prefer to acquire the assets of the business for the company.
- Practically, choice will not always be available.

### Seller's Perspective

| Aspect                        | Shares                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Clean break from business     | Following disposal of shares, seller loses connection with the company. Liabilities against the company continue to be enforceable against it. But note that the buyer will make detailed investigations and seek wide protections in the SPA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Legal liability to 3rd parties for debts and obligations of the business remains with the seller company. Under English law, even where the buyer has contracted to assume responsibility for liabilities in the SPA, this will not affect 3rd parties, who can still take action against the seller unless expressly released from liability. The seller would then have a right of indemnity from the buyer, but this can be difficult to enforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Warranties and due diligence  | Wider protections, generally more extensive investigation into the affairs of the target company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | No need for complex taxation warranties and indemnities; most contingent tax liabilities remain with the seller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Transfer of title             | In E&W, just need a stock transfer form to transfer title of shares. Check company's contracts in case any of them terminate on a change of control of the company/ 3rd party consent required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Each separate asset of the business must be transferred. This can be complicated, e.g., getting the consent of a landlord for the transfer of leasehold property. Some assets like stock and loose plant and machinery can be transferred by delivery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Financial services regulation | Purchase of shares classified as an investment and subject to financial services regulation. FSMA 2000 regulates investment activities, FCA oversees all financial and banking services. Under s 21 FSMA 2000, advising on or arranging the purchase or sale of shares comes under the definition of an investment activity. Breach of the restriction is an offence rendering the SPA unenforceable. Lawyers giving advice in relation to a proposed sale of shares must ensure FSMA requirements are satisfied/ transaction falls within a RAO 2001 exception. | FSMA 2000 provisions do not apply. But may need to act in a FSMA compliant way in case it changes to a share purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Employees                     | No change of employer: the target company is the employer. Seller no longer has a direct interest, other than any warranties given to the buyer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | TUPE 2006 applies: the transfer does not operate to terminate contracts of employment. Rights and obligations in respect of an employee working in an economic entity are transferred automatically to the buyer, who takes on responsibility for these employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Taxation                      | Tax consequences of a sale of shares by individuals: CGT charges, subject to exemptions/ reliefs. Where a company is owned by another, a sale of shares resulting in the selling company receiving consideration directly. Any capital gain realised likely to be exempt of corporation tax, if the seller is disposing of a substantial shareholding.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Two-tier taxation: receiving the purchase price and taking a further step (e.g., declaring dividend, liquidating company) are both separate chargeable points. Corporation tax payable on the sale of assets. Further charge when the proceeds of tsale of the assets are distributed to the shareholders. Taxation depends on whether the shareholder is an individual or a company. Individual & winding up: disposal of shares for CGT purposes. Individual and dividend: income tax charge on the shareholders. Corporate shareholder: unlikely to be taxed. Distribution on winding up will likely be covered by the substantial shareholder exemption; distribution by dividend covered by group relief on intra-company dividends. |

### Reinvesting Proceeds

#### Assets

Roll-over relief from CGT/ corporation tax under s 152 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (TCGA 1992) available on the disposal of qualifying assets used in the trade where the disposal proceeds are applied in the acquisition of replacement qualifying assets. See [[Capital Gains Tax]].

#### Shares: Individual Sellers

An individual shareholder who reinvests a chargeable gain from the disposal of shares in subscribing for shares which qualify for the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) will be able to claim a deferral relief.

#### Shares: Corporate Sellers

Capital gains arising on the disposal by companies of substantial shareholdings in trading companies are exempt from tax.

### Buyer's Perspective

Additional considerations to those listed above:

| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trade continuity                 | Company assets and outstanding contracts remain legally unaffected by the change in ownership. But buyer has no guarantee that 3rd parties will continue to deal with the company (who are not contractually obliged to do so). Some contracts contain clauses which permit a party to terminate a contract where control of the company changes hands. US state laws: sometimes consents are needed from 3rd parties. | Benefit of existing contracts not automatically transferred to the buyer on a sale of the assets. Must be transferred to the buyer through assignment/ novation. If a formal route is taken, 3rd party may try to renegotiate terms.

### Taxation

#### Base Costs for CGT

On an asset acquisition, chargeable assets have a higher base cost for CGT purposes on their subsequent disposal. When the buyer later disposes of the assets in future, it will be charged to capital tax based on any increase in value since the date of acquisition.

With a share acquisition, although shares are acquired at market value, the base cost of the assets is the cost at which they were originally acquired by the company. So corporation tax will be charged based on the increase in value of the asset since originally acquired by the company. This is a deferred tax liability (buyer should seek a discount on the shares).

#### Capital Allowances

Purchase of plant and machinery allows the buyer to obtain income deduction in the form of writing down allowances on the purchase price. Seller's point of view: disadvantage if actual price paid exceeds the tax written down value. Seller will then be subject to a balancing charge. But potentially a balancing allowance if the price paid is less than the written down value.

#### Apportionment of the Purchase Consideration

Necessary to apportion the total consideration between the various assets acquired. This is “flexible” to accrue tax advantages. Buyer should push for weight in favour of:

- Qualifying plant and machinery
- Trading stock forming a deduction against income profits for the buyer
- Capital items qualifying for capital tax roll-over relief on replacement of business assets.

#### Acquiring Tax Position of Company

Share acquisition: tax identity of the company continues. So tax liabilities may arise in relation to activities occurring in the company before the sale. Buyer generally seeks indemnity against such costs, in the “Tax Deed of Covenant”, a schedule to the SPA.

Share acquisition can enable a buyer to take advantage of tax credits within the company. s 45 Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010) permits trading losses to be carried forward and set against trading profits from the same trade in the future. If a buyer is convinced it can turn around the fortunes of the company, the accumulated losses can be viewed as an “asset”.

Carry forward of losses not possible on an asset acquisition.

#### VAT

VAT charge may arise on the disposal of business assets alone, though not on sufficient assets to enable the business to continue as a going concern. Generally not chargeable on a share sale.

#### Stamp Duty

On the acquisition of shares, buyer pays stamp duty at 0.5% (rounded up to nearest £5) on the purchase price.

On the acquisition of shares, the buyer pays stamp duty on dutiable assets only (land, shares).

# Acquisition Process

## Role of Advisers

Parties' lawyers will be expected to:

- Achieve the legal transfer of ownership from seller to buyer of either the shares or the assets of the company, as appropriate.
- Identify risks of a legal nature.

Accountant's role:

- Identify financial and tax risks
- Offer advise on the most efficient way to structure a proposed acquisition
- Put a value on the assets of a target business.

## UK Merger Control

Parties to a merger can notify the relevant authorities in advance of completion or post-completion. Often notify in advance if referral to a competition body is a possibility. Mergers regulated in the UK by Enterprise Act 2002 and in the EU by European Regulation 139/2004.

EA 2002 applies if:

1. Two or more enterprises cease to be distinct;
	- s 129(1) EA 2002: enterprise is the activities/ part of the activities of a business.
	- Business: an undertaking carried out for gain or reward, in the course of which goods and services are supplied otherwise than free of charge.
	- At least one of the enterprises must be carried out in the UK
	- Cease to be distinct if:
		- Brought under common ownership/ control
		- One of the enterprises ceases to carry on at all pursuant to some arrangement entered into to prevent competition between enterprises.
2. The time limit for a reference to the CMA has not yet expired; and
	- s 24 EA 2002: if **$>4$ months** have elapsed since merger, no reference to the CMA will be possible.
3. Either of the following is fulfilled:
	1. The market share test, or
		- Merger will result in $\geq 25\%$ of all goods and services of a particular description supplied in the UK, or a substantial part of it, being supplied by or to the same person.
			- Or if this was already the case before the merger, then after the merger the enterprise acquires an even greater market share.
	2. The turnover test.
		- The value of the annual turnover in the UK of the enterprise being taken over exceeds £70 million.

If the target enterprise carries out activities relating to certain military sector activities, quantum technology, computer processing or certain goods subject to export control, turnover test threshold reduced to £1 million and market share test satisfied by target enterprise alone meeting $25\%$ test prior to merger.

### Procedure

Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (ERRA 2013) amends Competition Act 1998 and EA 2002.

EA 2002 established a 2-stage voluntary merger notification regime:

| Phase   | Details                                                                                                                            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Parties to a merger could first refer the transaction to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) where informal guidance couuld be given. |
| Phase 2 | If OFT believed the merger posed a real prospect of a substantial lessening of competition, OFT had a duty to refer the transaction to the Competition Commission.                                                                                                                                    |

New regime: same review process, but now carried out by the CMA. OFT and Competition Commission abolished. CMA has wider powers, including making of interim orders (e.g., suspending all integration steps until clearance given).

Steps:

| Phase                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Informal discussions | Usual and advisable, to establish level of information the CMA will require                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Formal notification  | Serve a Merger Notice on the CMA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Phase 1              | Decisions taken by the CMA board, which has 40 working days to conduct its investigation and reach a conclusion. Period starts from when CMA confirms the information it has is sufficient. CMA retains the power to stop the clock if parties fail to comply with formal information requests. |
| Phase 2              | Made by an inquiry group of $\geq 3$ people selected from independent experts appointed to CMA panel by SoS. Investigations must be completed within 24 weeks of the date the reference is made, subject to a possible 8 week extension.                                                        |
| Post-phases         | CMA has the power to discuss remedies with the parties to the merger. Parties may offer formal undertakings to the CMA if this will secure approval for the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

```ad-note
There are proposals requiring mandatory notification of mergers above a certain threshold, and "standstill obligations" to halt the transaction until CMA approval is granted. But not yet in effect. 
```

### National Security and Investment Act 2021

Gives the UK Govt the ability to intervene in M&A threatening national security. Transactions could be blocked/ have conditions imposed on them. The Act came into force 04/01/22, but has retrospective effect back to 12/11/20.

Applies to businesses of any size and both UK and non-UK acquirers. Proposed transactions in “high-risk” sectors (nuclear, military, communications) require mandatory notification; other notification is voluntary.

```ad-note
June 2020: Enterprise Act 2002 amended to allow Govt. to intervene on public interest grounds in any transaction falling within the UK merger control regime, where the business is considered important to efforts to combat public health emergencies. 
```

## European Merger Control

### European Regulation 139/2004

```ad-important
The EU Merger Regulation will apply if the merger constitutes a concentration within a Union dimension. 
```

Pre-Brexit, if the merger fulfilled these criteria, the EU Merger Regulation applied, to the exclusion of any national competition law rules, and the European Commission had exclusive jurisdiction.

Post-Brexit: the CMA is no longer precluded from taking jurisdiction over UK qualifying mergers which also meet the EU Merger Regulation's thresholds. So parties may need to notify the CMA and the European Commission.

#### Concentration

Article 3 EU Merger Regulation: a concentration can arise where a change of control on a lasting basis results from:

1. the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings or parts of undertakings; or
2. the acquisition of direct or indirect control of the whole or part of an undertaking or undertakings.

- “Control” is widely defined to mean more than just voting control. Includes the situation where one party can exercise decisive influence over another. So a $25\%$ holding may suffice.
- “Acquisition” is widely defined to comprise a direct financial purchase by contract, a purchase of shares or securities, or any other resources.

#### Union Dimension

Article 1 provides that a concentration will have a Union dimension if, subject to the two-thirds rule (see below), it fulfils certain turnover criteria. There are two alternative sets of criteria to consider, namely:

Under Article 1(2):

 1. The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of all the undertakings concerned exceeds €5,000 million; and
 2. The aggregate Union-wide turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned exceeds €250 million.

Under Article 1(3):

1. The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of all the undertakings concerned is more than €2,500 million;
2. In each of at least three Member States, the combined aggregate turnover of all the undertakings concerned is more than €100 million;
3. In each of at least three Member States included for the purpose of point (b), the aggregate turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than €25 million (i.e. both the buyer and seller is >25m); and
4. The aggregate Union-wide turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than €100 million.

```ad-warning
Aggregate means aggregate within the company. Combined means between buyer and seller. 
```

```ad-note
Even if the merger does not have a Union dimension, the EU Merger Regulation provides that the parties can request the European Commission to take jurisdiction over the transaction if the merger is capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of at least three Member States.
```

#### Two-thirds Rule

A concentration will not have a Union dimension if each of the undertakings concerned achieves $>\frac{2}{3}$ of its aggregate Union-wide turnover within one and the same Member State.

### Notification

If the merger constitutes a concentration with a Union dimension, then the EU Merger Regulation provides that the parties must notify the European Commission before completion. The merger cannot complete until the European Commission clears it.

The parties must fill in Form CO, or Short Form CO to give details about the parties and proposed transaction.

Then the Commission has 25 working days to decide

1. it does not have jurisdiction because the merger does not fall within the scope of the EU Merger Regulation; or
2. it will clear the transaction (because it does not create or strengthen a dominant position in any relevant Union market); or
3. it will investigate the transaction further (because it has serious concerns that it may create or strengthen a dominant position in any relevant Union market).

### Exceptions

A Member State can intervene to request repatriation of a case if it can demonstrate that a reference back to the national authorities was necessary:

1. To protect legitimate interests, or
2. Because the merger significantly threatened competition in a distinct market in the Member State.

```ad-tip
CMA is likely to concurrently review mergers which are caught by the EU Merger Regulation. 
```

## Acquisition Procedure

### Pre-contract

- Buyer investigates target
- Terms of the proposed purchase negotiated

### Heads of Agreement

- Principal commercial terms set out in a "heads of agreement" (or “letter of intent”). May provide for a period of exclusive negotiation.
- This is not legally binding, but serves as a starting point for SPA.
- In civil code jurisdictions, the pre-contractual relationship may give rise to a duty of good faith between parties.

### Confidentiality Agreement

Parties will enter into a confidentiality agreement/ ND specifying the parties' obligations in relation to confidential information, procedures for handling it, and remedies for breach.

### Due Diligence

Before entering into a contractual commitment, the buyer should acquire as much information as possible about the business. Buyer's lawyers may produce a due diligence report on the main areas of risk identified.

### Contract

Negotiate terms. When both parties are ready, enter SPA. At the same time, the seller will hand over a disclosure letter to the buyer.

#### SPA

A first draft of the SPA is usually prepared by the buyer's lawyers and is submitted to the seller's lawyers for approval/ negotiation. The parties will agree to transfer title to the shares or the assets of the business. Then a long list of warranties/ indemnities from the seller to the buyer.

On a share acquisition the whole company is acquired, including its tax liabilities, and there will usually be a separate Tax Covenant by which the seller agrees to indemnify the buyer for any tax costs which arise as a result of events occurring prior to the sale of the company.

In some civil code jurisdictions, the first draft is prepared by the seller outlining the basis on which the seller is prepared to offer the shares or assets for sale. This also applies in England and Wales where the target is being offered for sale by way of an auction.

#### Disclosure Letter

Prepared by the seller's lawyers. The purpose of the document is to disclose matters relating to the target and its affairs which, if undisclosed, would result in the seller being in breach of warranty.

Documents referred to n the letter are attached – the “disclosure bundle”.

The disclosure letter may be written by the seller or by the seller’s lawyers. In the latter case it should incorporate an appropriate disclaimer that all information has been provided by the client and that the lawyers accept no responsibility for its contents. The letter is handed to the buyer at the same time as the parties enter into the sale and purchase agreement.

The disclosure letter is itself a negotiated document; the buyer may try to negotiate a price reduction/ specific indemnities as a result of the disclosures listed.

### Pre-completion

Completion normally takes place immediately after SPA is signed. But there may be a gap, with completion conditional on certain events. Buyer will want to ensure that there is no change in the general state of the assets/ the company.

### Completion

Title to the assets which are the subject of the acquisition is formally transferred by the seller to the buyer in return for the buyer paying the purchase price/ consideration.

Share sale in E&W:

- Seller's lawyers will hand over signed stock transfer forms
- Completion board meeting of the target company to deal with resignation/ appointment of directors and approval of share transfers.
- Method of completion usually a clause in the SPA.
- Documents to be executed at completion will be referred to in the SPA as being in the “agreed form”. Will often be annexed/ contained in schedules.

Asset sale:

- Individual assets transferred in the appropriate way
- Land included must be transferred by deed
- Assignment of IP rights is necessary
- Goodwill and the benefit of contracts may need to be formally assigned.

### Post-completion

Buyer's lawyer ensures that:

- Stock transfer forms duly stamped
- Internal registers of the target company are updated to reflect changes in members and directors
- Appropriate information filed at Companies House.
- Land Registry registrations.
- Steps to incorporate acquired assets into the existing business organisation.

## Pre-contractual Documentation

Target company or assets must be investigated and the terms of proposed SPA negotiated.

### Confidentiality Agreement

Initial draft usually prepared by seller/ seller's advisers, since the seller is most exposed to potential release of information. Generally a standard format is used, but there may be scope for negotiation. Buyer will seek to reduce restrictions imposed, especially those costing money.

Will generally include:

- Definition of confidential information
- Obligation on the buyer not to disclose or use such information except for authorised purposes in connection with the acquisition. Buyer may be prevented from soliciting customers, suppliers or employees of the target for a specified period.
- Undertaking by the buyer to return or destroy such information if the acquisition does not proceed.
- Agreement that the parties will not make any announcement or disclosure of the fact negotiations have taken place.

Often undertakings contained in a letter to the seller. Consideration must be given: this is usually the provision by the seller of the confidential information.

A confidentiality agreement provides comfort to a seller who is in a commercially sensitive position. May prove difficult for the seller to monitor breaches and assess loss. So important to specify monitoring procedures. For extremely sensitive information, do not disclose until exchange of contracts.

French law: no agreement can last for an indefinite period. So the agreement must stipulate a period for which the information is confidential.

Liquidated damages clauses usually drafted in confidentiality agreements. Common to agree a fixed amount for a breach.

### Heads of Agreement

Aims:

- Focuses the minds of parties
- Establish whether there are significant areas of agreement to make it worth continuing.

Not universally employed in acquisitions. Two main issues with heads of agreement:

1. Whether the terms are legally binding
2. Whether the buyer is granted an exclusive right to bargain with the seller.

#### Legally Binding

The intention is almost always for the heads of agreement **not** to be legally binding; the buyer will want to first conduct a detailed investigation of the target.

Normal practice is for the Heads of Agreement to be marked "subject to contract" and to include a statement that the provisions are not intended to be legally binding.

Often some clauses should be legally binding, e.g., those relating to confidentiality, exclusivity of bargaining and liability for costs in the event of an abortive transaction.

#### Civil Law Position

In Continental European civil law jurisdictions, it is possible to enter into an agreement to agree. A Heads of Agreement may be construed by courts as a binding pre-agreement. A binding contract can be avoided through careful drafting, though in some jurisdictions the contents of the letter as a whole and the subsequent conduct of parties is considered when assessing whether it is legally binding.

Most of Continental Europe imposes a general duty to negotiate in good faith: *culpa in contrahendo*. This extends to all commercial relationships, including pre-contractual ones. So even if a heads of agreement is not legally binding, it may establish a duty of good faith between the parties.

The duty of good faith usually includes obligations:

1. to inform each other where reasonable of all points which, if known by the other party, might be expected to lead it to change its views on material aspects of the transaction;
2. to observe reasonable diligence in the performance of pre-contractual obligations; and
3. to observe ethical standards of behaviour.

This could be breached by, e.g., withdrawing from negotiations without reasonable justification. The obligations can often be excluded by including, e.g., an express right of either party to terminate negotiations at any stage without incurring any obligations or liability. The remedy is usually damages based on the reliance interest (put the party back in the position they would have been had negotiations not taken place) – so legal fees etc. paid.

But in Germany and the Netherlands, can claim damages for loss of opportunity in certain circumstances.

#### Exclusivity

A buyer may be reluctant to spend time and money undertaking a full investigation into the target unless granted an exclusive bargaining right for a certain period. An agreement not to negotiate with anyone else (“lock-out agreements”) for a fixed period is enforceable provided it is sufficiently certain ([[Walford v Miles [1992] 2 WLR 174]]). But held in that case that agreements to negotiate in good faith (“lock-in agreements”), even those with a time-limit, are unenforceable because they are too uncertain.

```ad-important
An undertaking for a limited period of time to negotiate in good faith can be enforceable if the obligation is sufficiently certain. In [[Petromec Inc Petro Deep Societa Armanmento SpA v Petroleo Brasilerio SpA [2005] EWCA Civ 891]], held that an undertaking to to ‘negotiate in good faith’ on costs, set out in a formally negotiated document as part a series of binding contracts, was enforceable. This obligation was held not to be inconsistent with the ruling in Walford as the obligation was narrow in context, the terms were objectively ascertainable and it was part of a series of binding agreements.
```

The exclusivity clause should include a remedy in the event of a breach; usually the recovery of costs incurred in pursuing the acquisition. Unclear whether costs incurred before the execution of the lock-out agreement would be covered by such a provision. The English case of [[Radiant Shipping Co and Sea Containers [1995] CLC 976]] provided that costs incurred before the execution of the agreement could be recovered if this was expressly provided for, as long as it did not amount to a penalty.

The usual consideration for the exclusivity clause is the buyer's commitment to finance the due diligence investigation.

Need:

1. Time certainty
2. Consideration for the promise
3. Framed as a lock-out clause.

```ad-action
- Express exclusivity clause as an agreement not to negotiate with anyone else for a fixed period. 
- Provision for the remedy should allow for the recovery of all expenses, whether incurred before or after execution of the exclusivity provision.
```

In Europe, lock-ins are acceptable in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, the duty to negotiate in good faith complicates things.

### Choice of Law

Enforceability of choice of law provisions may be subject to international or state conventions. Within the US, the validity of a choice of law provision depends on the state's choice of law rules (e.g., Delaware is strict).

In Europe:

- Rome I Regulation (Rome I) applies to contractual obligations.
	- Reinforces parties' freedom to choose the applicable law and governing jurisdiction.
	- Subject to exceptions in consumer contracts, employment contracts and insurance contracts.
	- Article 3(1) states the right of the parties to choose the law which governs a contract but provides, under Article 3(3), that where all other elements at the time of the choice are located in a country other than the country whose law has been chosen, the choice of the parties will not prejudice the provisions of the law of that other country which cannot be derogated from by agreement.
	- So there should be some connection to the jurisdiction chosen.
- Rome II Regulation (Rome II) applies to non-contractual obligations.
	- Applies to all EU countries except Denmark.
	- A provision on the choice of law may determine the rules applicable to the relationship between the parties even before the contract is formally binding.

# Investigating the Target

## Buyer's Objectives

A buyer will not want to enter into a binding commitment to acquire the garget unless it has as much information as possible. *Caveat emptor* means the buyer will try to acquire as much information as possible, but will also negotiate lots of warranties and indemnities into the SPA.

Civil law counties implement a principle of buyer protection; statutory protections for a buyer in corporate acquisitions. Also the duty to negotiate in good faith includes a duty to inform. Significant at all stages, including due diligence.

In Germany, the seller has disclosure obligations towards a buyer to disclose certain material facts. Under French law, failure to disclose material facts could amount to deceit. So there is often far less due diligence in such countries.

## Types

### Business Advisers

Commercial assessment undertaken by the buyer/ professional business advisers.

### Accountants

- Buyer may instruct a firm of accountants to investigate the target and produce a report.
- Accountant report plays a role in framing the acquisition report, particularly warranties and indemnities
- Firm of accountants formally instructed by a letter of engagement.
- Report should cover:
	- Commercial activities of target
		- Details of past, present and planned activities
		- Market in which target operates
		- Pricing policy, terms of trade, supplier arrangements, customers, agents.
	- Management structure and employees
		- Directors and senior management details
		- Directors and senior management service contracts
		- Number of other employees
		- Training and recruitment.
	- Taxation
		- Target's current tax position
		- Effect of acquisition on tax affairs of target and buyer
		- Likely future tax position
		- Warranties and indemnities to obtain.
	- Profitability
		- Audited results for past few years.
	- Balance sheet strength
		- Borrowing commitments
		- Capital expenditure, capital commitments, long-term contracts, liabilities
		- Debtors and bad debts.
	- Accounting systems and policies
	- Premises
		- Location, use and tenure of each property.

Buyer may use the report as a lever for lowering the acquisition price. Practice on allowing the seller to have a copy of the report is variable. Sometimes the disclosure letter may deem matters referred to in the accountants' report to have been disclosed by the seller, and the buyer may insist on a warranty as to the accuracy of its contents.

Under English law, the buyer will have claims against the reporting accountants if the report is negligently prepared (both in contract for breach of the implied duty of reasonable skill and care, and in tort for negligent misstatement).

### Legal Advisers

Legal due diligence is usually undertaken by the buyer's legal advisers. Generally focuses on the constitutional framework of the target, terms on which the target does business, ownership of assets and restrictions, and the extent of potential liabilities.

The process may, however, be limited by legal restrictions on the disclosure of information. For example, the management of a German GmbH cannot release certain corporate information without prior shareholder approval.

#### International Team

- Might need a due diligence coordinator.
- Conflicts of interest: general practice to apply the conflict rules of the jurisdiction in which the work is done.
- Fees may vary: success/ contingency fees prohibited in many jurisdictions, some fees fixed.

## Scope of Legal Due Diligence

- Commercial aims
	- If the buyer is already familiar with the target, extensive due diligence less important.
	- Is the acquisition for expansion of a business or for investment?
- Consider risks in the market.
- Types of transaction
	- Acquisition of share capital likely to involve more extensive due diligence.
	- Buyer of assets does not generally assume the liabilities of the business. Buyer will direct investigation at specified assets and liabilities to be acquired.
- Seller may not be able/ prepared to give much contractual protection to the buyer
	- Insolvency practitioner will only give very limited contractual reassurances.
	- If the buyer can get lots of contractual protections, may not bother with very extensive due diligence.
- Practical limitations
	- Time constraints.
	- Financial resources and manpower
	- Confidentiality
		- Seller may want to keep the proposed sale a secret from its own workforce.
		- May be reluctant to hand over commercially sensitive information.
		- Consent of 3rd parties may be needed to view some information.
		- Seller must take care not to breach its own confidentiality obligations.

## Undertaking Investigation

- Public searches
	- Companies House records
	- HM Land Registry property records
	- Registered IP rights
	- Trade press, commercial information.
- Questionnaire
	- Due diligence questionnaire forwarded to the buyer.
	- Should be tailored to the business.
- Data room
	- The seller and its legal advisers make information about the target available to the buyer.
	- Aims to protect commercially sensitive material
	- Agree a list of people who can access the data room
	- Documents provided in read-only format.

## Areas of Investigation

### Corporate Information

- Companies House search, and similar in other jurisdictions.
- The obligation to file information at Companies House is placed on the company itself, and although the company and its officers are liable to fines on default, there is no provision for compensating a third party who suffers loss as a result of this information being incomplete or inaccurate.
- Information on Companies House may be out of date.

#### Constitutional Documents

- Check the company has the power to carry on the business and discuss steps to be taken at completion.
- Check articles for any restriction on share transfer.

#### Directors and Shareholders

- Starting point: confirmation statement sent by the company to the Registrar of Companies.
- Ask the company if anything has changed since this last return.
- Check if the directors hold any other directorships.

#### Internal Registers and Minutes

- Check allotments and transfers of shares have been carried out in accordance with statute and the articles.
- Subject to confidentiality, can likely view any board minutes.

### Financial Information

- Study accounts, regardless of whether a full accountants' report is commissioned.
- Work with the accountants to consider what warranties or indemnities should be included.
- IFRS has removed some of the differences in availability, content and presentation of financial information between European countries. Still differences in what accounts reflect a “true and fair view” judgment of company accounts.
- US companies use US GAAP.

#### Loans

- On an asset acquisition, check whether any assets are subject to a charge.
- On a share acquisition, request copies of all loan documentation. Check whether any loans are repayable on demand or entitle the lender to remand immediate repayment of the balance of the loan on a change of control.
- Has the seller guaranteed any obligations of the target? Buyer may be asked to procure the release of the seller from such guarantees and indemnify the seller if release is not obtained on completion.
- If group companies have guaranteed each others obligations, buyer will insist such obligations do not continue after completion.

#### Charges

- Check Charges Register at Companies House. Information on record may not be accurate or up to date (21 days from creation to register).
- If charges have not been registered, the loan becomes repayable immediately.
- Buyer may acquire a credit report.

#### Check Solvency

- Bankruptcy search at the Land Charges Department should be carried out against individual sellers of shares or of a business immediately before completion.
- Companies House search to check for corporate insolvency.
- Also ring the Central Registry of winding-up petitions.

### Key Contracts

- Share acquisition: lack of disruption with target's trade.
- Buyer will require full details and copies of all significant contracts into which the target has entered.
- On an asset sale, examine those considered vital to the business and check if they require consent to assignment/ restrictions on assignment.
- Share sale: check for any change of control clauses.
- Check expiry of contracts and whether they can be terminated on short notice.
- Check for proper execution of contracts.

#### Change of Control

- Often found in employment contracts (e.g., golden parachute clauses).
- Non-arm's length trading relationships
	- Sellers of the target may have been supplying goods or services to the target directly or through other companies in which they have an interest.
	- Where the target is a member of a group, ask for information on all goods and services supplied to/ from other members of the group.
	- May need to implement a transitional arrangement where the seller agrees to provide certain support services for a defined period.

#### IP Rights

- Ask for full details
- Carry out searches of UK IP office to establish that the target's IP rights are valid and do not infringe on IP rights owned by others.
- IP rights may have been registered in the name of a founder - check what the target actually owns.
- Transfer any IP rights to the target/ seller by (1) an assignment of the rights to the target, and (2) recording of such assignment in IP registers.
- If assignment of a right is not recorded within 6 months, only beneficial title to the right is transferred, not the legal right.

### Employees and Pensions

- The rights and obligations of employees working in a business which is acquired will usually transfer automatically to the buyer (TUPE 2006).
- Review service contracts of current employees, especially if changes are to be made.
- In the US, in the absence of an express written agreement or binding oral agreement, an employee's contract can be terminated without notice and without cause at any time.

#### Collective Arrangements

e.g., trade union recognition, workplace agreements. France and Germany have very strict rules about notification to employees of any proposed transfer.

#### Retaining Managers and Directors

Negotiate as early as possible (subject to confidentiality considerations).

#### Restrictive Covenants

- Check whether the service contracts of the target's personnel contain effective restraints on their activities after termination.
- Typical clauses: not to work in a competing business, not to solicitor or entice away customers.
- English law: valid and enforceable only if to protect a legitimate trade interest of the employer, are not against the public interest and are reasonable between the parties ([[in Tillman v Egon Zehnder [2019] UKSC 32]]).
- Non-solicitation clause should be limited to customers who have recently dealt with the target.
- Non-competition clause should be limited in duration and geographic area.
- Clauses preventing the disclosure of information after termination can only be effective in relation to highly confidential information or trade secrets ([[Faccenda Chicken Ltd v Fowler [1986] IRLR 69, CA]]).
- If any of the directors who are leaving are also selling shares in the target, the buyer should ensure that they agree to restrictive covenants in the sale and purchase agreement (more likely to be upheld than provisions in the SPA).
- Restrictive covenants which are prima facie valid will not survive a repudiatory breach of contract by the employer. There is a danger that if the target dismisses employees in breach of contract, this may discharge former employees from compliance with restrictive covenants ([[General Billposting Co Ltd v Atkinson [1909] AC 118, HL]]).

#### Pensions

- Target must satisfy obligations to enrol workers in a pension scheme and make contributions on their behalf, under auto-enrolment regime.
- Buyer's lawyers will require full details of any pension scheme.
- Check the type of pension scheme: final salary scheme (members guaranteed a particular level of benefit on retirement) or money purchase scheme (benefit dependent on return on fund)
- Is pension scheme stand-alone or part of a larger scheme involving other employees
- US: defined contribution vs defined benefit schemes. V similar to the UK version.

### Property

- May prove impractical to carry out full structural surveys etc. 2 means of protection for the buyer:
	- Certificate of title given by seller's solicitor – chiefly that the properties have good and marketable title. Law Society standard form certificate, generally accepted in commercial transactions. If a false statement/ omission in the certificate is the result of incorrect information supplied by the client, the buyer will have no recourse against the seller's solicitor and will need to rely on a warranty against the seller.
	- Warranties in the SPA: usually sought by the buyer (e.g., that the properties are in good repair).
- Inspection/ valuation – physical inspection of properties important to the target is advisable. For leaseholds, check whether the repairing obligations under the lease have been complied with.

#### Landlord Consents

- Frequently required for the assignment of any leaseholder premises included in the sale.
- Buyer's lawyers should check whether the seller has guaranteed lease obligations.
- Seller likely to ask for an undertaking from the buyer that the buyer uses best endeavours to obtain the release of the seller from guarantees and to indemnify the seller against any liability.
- Talk to landlord (subject to confidentiality).

#### UK Leases Pre-1996

- Original tenant of leasehold remained liable to the landlord for breaches of the terms of the lease even after assignment.
- On an asset sale, the seller may, therefore, have a contingent liability after completing the assignment to the buyer of leasehold premises of which it was the original tenant. On a share sale, the buyer’s lawyers should ask whether the target company has been granted a lease at any time.
- Investigation of share purchase
- Buyer of shares will not obtain protection from searches of official registers in the same way as a buyer of business assets - since protection is afforded to a buyer of an interest in the land, whereas on a share acquisition there is no change in ownership.
- Does not have the benefit of any priority period in which to complete the acquisition without further matters appearing on the register.
- Not entitled to receive compensation from a local authority which fails to register a local land charge (Local Land Charges Act 1975).

### Environmental Matters

- Share acquisition: buyer directly liable for past actions of the company, since it is taking over the identity of the target.
- The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1154), as amended by the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/110), require an environmental permit to be obtained by any person operating a regulated facility.
- Permit often issued subject to certain conditions

#### Penalties

Breach of various provisions of the environmental legislation, such as operating a regulated facility without an environmental permit, will give rise to criminal liability. Clean-up costs and any damages resulting from civil liability can prove to be extremely substantial.

#### Public Information

Information on environmental matters available to the public through registers compiled and maintained by the regulator.

#### Transfer of Environmental Permits

- Ask the seller for copies of all relevant environmental permits.
- Check they are in force and cover all relevant operations.
- Transfer of an environmental permit to a new operator is only possible if the regulator is satisfied the transferee is competent to operate the regulated facility in accordance with the terms of the permit.

Other searches may also be done, e.g., site visits, desktop survey, environmental audit.

#### Bribery Act 2010 and Modern Slavery Act 2015

The Bribery Act 2010 (BA 2010) came into force on 1 July 2011 and is enforced chiefly by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The Act creates four offences – broadly, those of offering a bribe, accepting a bribe, bribing a foreign public official and, for commercial organisations, failing to prevent bribery. All transactions are covered.

Breach of the BA 2010 carries stiff criminal penalties – for individuals, up to 10 years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine, and unlimited fines for companies. Obtain warranty protection from the seller in the usual way. Particularly important since the bribery is unlikely to be glaringly obvious.

Any organisation which has a turnover of £36 million or more is obliged to publish a transparency statement under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The statement must confirm either the steps the company has taken during the previous financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in its supply chain, or that the company has taken no such steps.

## Due Diligence Reports

In large transactions, legal advisers may be expected to produce a legal due diligence report. Information revealed in the report will be used in negotiation of the acquisition documentation and warranties/ indemnities required by buyer.

- Interim reports may be produced for the buyer summarising areas of importance
- A full audit is rare because very expensive to produce.
- The usual form of report is “by exception”. Focuses on matters material to the proposed acquisition, or those which are unusual/ unexpected.

### Format of Report

An executive summary should set out the key findings of the report. May include key proposals to be fulfilled before the acquisition can proceed. The buyer will have claims against legal advisers if the report is negligently prepared.

The buyer of shares or assets may have relied on statements, forecasts and opinions by parties other than the seller. Remedy against third parties available if the information is false or misleading.

#### Caparo

[[Caparo Industries v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 (HL)]].

Caparo, which was a shareholder in Fidelity plc, acquired control of the company relying on the audited accounts. Caparo claimed that the accounts were inaccurate and misleading in showing a pre-tax profit, when in fact the company had made a loss. It sued the company’s auditors for negligence in auditing the accounts (and certifying them as ‘true and accurate’). Caparo alleged that the auditors owed it a duty of care either as a potential investor, or as an existing shareholder. The Court of Appeal held that the auditors owed Caparo a duty of care as a shareholder but not as a potential investor.

The House of Lords emphasised that the imposition of a duty of care in economic loss cases required ‘proximity’ of relationship as well as foreseeability of loss (a third criterion being that it must not be unreasonable to impose a duty of care). In determining the question of proximity, there was no single general principle, and the court should be guided by established categories of negligence. A review of previous cases in this area led the House of Lords to identify three conditions for proximity to exist. It must be shown that the maker of the statement knew the following:

1. that the statement would be communicated to the person relying on it or to a clearly defined class of person to whom that person belonged; and
2. this would be done specifically in connection with a particular transaction or a particular type of transaction; and
3. the person would be very likely to rely on it in deciding whether to enter into the transaction.

#### Morgan Crucible

[[Morgan Crucible plc v Hill Samuel and Co Ltd [1991] 2 WLR 665]].

Following a takeover bid for a listed company by the plaintiffs (claimants), the chairman of the listed company incorporated various statements and profit forecasts in documents issued to shareholders and to the press as a defence to the bid. The plaintiffs increased their bid and successfully acquired control of the company. Some of the financial statements and forecasts were misleading, and the company was not as valuable as this information had led the plaintiffs to believe. They sued the chairman, the auditors and the merchant bank advising the board in negligence.

 On an application to amend the statement of claim after the decision in Caparo (the original claim had also been based on financial statements made prior to the bid and the plaintiffs wished to restrict it to statements, etc made after the bid), the Court of Appeal granted leave on the grounds that the amended claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. The Court was of the view that it was arguable that there was a sufficient degree of proximity since the defendants intended the plaintiffs to rely on the representations in deciding whether to make an increased bid. (The case settled before reaching trial.)

### Main Report

The main report is usually divided into sections covering each area of the target business. Each issue investigated is identified, together with the results of that investigation and any possible impact there may be for the proposed acquisition.
