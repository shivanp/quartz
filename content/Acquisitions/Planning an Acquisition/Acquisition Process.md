# Acquisition Process

## Role of Advisers

Parties' lawyers will be expected to:

- Achieve the legal transfer of ownership from seller to buyer of either the shares or the assets of the company, as appropriate.
- Identify risks of a legal nature.

Accountant's role:

- Identify financial and tax risks
- Offer advise on the most efficient way to structure a proposed acquisition
- Put a value on the assets of a target business.

## UK Merger Control

Parties to a merger can notify the relevant authorities in advance of completion or post-completion. Often notify in advance if referral to a competition body is a possibility. Mergers regulated in the UK by Enterprise Act 2002 and in the EU by European Regulation 139/2004.

EA 2002 applies if:

1. Two or more enterprises cease to be distinct;
	- s 129(1) EA 2002: enterprise is the activities/ part of the activities of a business.
	- Business: an undertaking carried out for gain or reward, in the course of which goods and services are supplied otherwise than free of charge.
	- At least one of the enterprises must be carried out in the UK
	- Cease to be distinct if:
		- Brought under common ownership/ control
		- One of the enterprises ceases to carry on at all pursuant to some arrangement entered into to prevent competition between enterprises.
2. The time limit for a reference to the CMA has not yet expired; and
	- s 24 EA 2002: if **$>4$ months** have elapsed since merger, no reference to the CMA will be possible.
3. Either of the following is fulfilled:
	1. The market share test, or
		- Merger will result in $\geq 25\%$ of all goods and services of a particular description supplied in the UK, or a substantial part of it, being supplied by or to the same person.
			- Or if this was already the case before the merger, then after the merger the enterprise acquires an even greater market share.
	2. The turnover test.
		- The value of the annual turnover in the UK of the enterprise being taken over exceeds £70 million.

If the target enterprise carries out activities relating to certain military sector activities, quantum technology, computer processing or certain goods subject to export control, turnover test threshold reduced to £1 million and market share test satisfied by target enterprise alone meeting $25\%$ test prior to merger.

### Procedure

Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (ERRA 2013) amends Competition Act 1998 and EA 2002.

EA 2002 established a 2-stage voluntary merger notification regime:

| Phase   | Details                                                                                                                            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Parties to a merger could first refer the transaction to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) where informal guidance couuld be given. |
| Phase 2 | If OFT believed the merger posed a real prospect of a substantial lessening of competition, OFT had a duty to refer the transaction to the Competition Commission.                                                                                                                                    |

New regime: same review process, but now carried out by the CMA. OFT and Competition Commission abolished. CMA has wider powers, including making of interim orders (e.g., suspending all integration steps until clearance given).

Steps:

| Phase                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Informal discussions | Usual and advisable, to establish level of information the CMA will require                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Formal notification  | Serve a Merger Notice on the CMA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Phase 1              | Decisions taken by the CMA board, which has 40 working days to conduct its investigation and reach a conclusion. Period starts from when CMA confirms the information it has is sufficient. CMA retains the power to stop the clock if parties fail to comply with formal information requests. |
| Phase 2              | Made by an inquiry group of $\geq 3$ people selected from independent experts appointed to CMA panel by SoS. Investigations must be completed within 24 weeks of the date the reference is made, subject to a possible 8 week extension.                                                        |
| Post-phases         | CMA has the power to discuss remedies with the parties to the merger. Parties may offer formal undertakings to the CMA if this will secure approval for the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

> [!note]
> There are proposals requiring mandatory notification of mergers above a certain threshold, and "standstill obligations" to halt the transaction until CMA approval is granted. But not yet in effect. 

### National Security and Investment Act 2021

Gives the UK Govt the ability to intervene in M&A threatening national security. Transactions could be blocked/ have conditions imposed on them. The Act came into force 04/01/22, but has retrospective effect back to 12/11/20.

Applies to businesses of any size and both UK and non-UK acquirers. Proposed transactions in “high-risk” sectors (nuclear, military, communications) require mandatory notification; other notification is voluntary.

> [!note]
> June 2020: Enterprise Act 2002 amended to allow Govt. to intervene on public interest grounds in any transaction falling within the UK merger control regime, where the business is considered important to efforts to combat public health emergencies. 

## European Merger Control

### European Regulation 139/2004

> [!important]
> The EU Merger Regulation will apply if the merger constitutes a concentration within a Union dimension. 

Pre-Brexit, if the merger fulfilled these criteria, the EU Merger Regulation applied, to the exclusion of any national competition law rules, and the European Commission had exclusive jurisdiction.

Post-Brexit: the CMA is no longer precluded from taking jurisdiction over UK qualifying mergers which also meet the EU Merger Regulation's thresholds. So parties may need to notify the CMA and the European Commission.

#### Concentration

Article 3 EU Merger Regulation: a concentration can arise where a change of control on a lasting basis results from:

1. the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings or parts of undertakings; or
2. the acquisition of direct or indirect control of the whole or part of an undertaking or undertakings.

- “Control” is widely defined to mean more than just voting control. Includes the situation where one party can exercise decisive influence over another. So a $25\%$ holding may suffice.
- “Acquisition” is widely defined to comprise a direct financial purchase by contract, a purchase of shares or securities, or any other resources.

#### Union Dimension

Article 1 provides that a concentration will have a Union dimension if, subject to the two-thirds rule (see below), it fulfils certain turnover criteria. There are two alternative sets of criteria to consider, namely:

Under Article 1(2):

 1. The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of all the undertakings concerned exceeds €5,000 million; and
 2. The aggregate Union-wide turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned exceeds €250 million.

Under Article 1(3):

1. The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of all the undertakings concerned is more than €2,500 million;
2. In each of at least three Member States, the combined aggregate turnover of all the undertakings concerned is more than €100 million;
3. In each of at least three Member States included for the purpose of point (b), the aggregate turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than €25 million (i.e. both the buyer and seller is >25m); and
4. The aggregate Union-wide turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than €100 million.

> [!warning]
> Aggregate means aggregate within the company. Combined means between buyer and seller. 

> [!note]
> Even if the merger does not have a Union dimension, the EU Merger Regulation provides that the parties can request the European Commission to take jurisdiction over the transaction if the merger is capable of being reviewed under the national competition laws of at least three Member States.

#### Two-thirds Rule

A concentration will not have a Union dimension if each of the undertakings concerned achieves $>\frac{2}{3}$ of its aggregate Union-wide turnover within one and the same Member State.

### Notification

If the merger constitutes a concentration with a Union dimension, then the EU Merger Regulation provides that the parties must notify the European Commission before completion. The merger cannot complete until the European Commission clears it.

The parties must fill in Form CO, or Short Form CO to give details about the parties and proposed transaction.

Then the Commission has 25 working days to decide

1. it does not have jurisdiction because the merger does not fall within the scope of the EU Merger Regulation; or
2. it will clear the transaction (because it does not create or strengthen a dominant position in any relevant Union market); or
3. it will investigate the transaction further (because it has serious concerns that it may create or strengthen a dominant position in any relevant Union market).

### Exceptions

A Member State can intervene to request repatriation of a case if it can demonstrate that a reference back to the national authorities was necessary:

1. To protect legitimate interests, or
2. Because the merger significantly threatened competition in a distinct market in the Member State.

> [!tip]
> CMA is likely to concurrently review mergers which are caught by the EU Merger Regulation. 

## Acquisition Procedure

### Pre-contract

- Buyer investigates target
- Terms of the proposed purchase negotiated

### Heads of Agreement

- Principal commercial terms set out in a "heads of agreement" (or “letter of intent”). May provide for a period of exclusive negotiation.
- This is not legally binding, but serves as a starting point for SPA.
- In civil code jurisdictions, the pre-contractual relationship may give rise to a duty of good faith between parties.

### Confidentiality Agreement

Parties will enter into a confidentiality agreement/ ND specifying the parties' obligations in relation to confidential information, procedures for handling it, and remedies for breach.

### Due Diligence

Before entering into a contractual commitment, the buyer should acquire as much information as possible about the business. Buyer's lawyers may produce a due diligence report on the main areas of risk identified.

### Contract

Negotiate terms. When both parties are ready, enter SPA. At the same time, the seller will hand over a disclosure letter to the buyer.

#### SPA

A first draft of the SPA is usually prepared by the buyer's lawyers and is submitted to the seller's lawyers for approval/ negotiation. The parties will agree to transfer title to the shares or the assets of the business. Then a long list of warranties/ indemnities from the seller to the buyer.

On a share acquisition the whole company is acquired, including its tax liabilities, and there will usually be a separate Tax Covenant by which the seller agrees to indemnify the buyer for any tax costs which arise as a result of events occurring prior to the sale of the company.

In some civil code jurisdictions, the first draft is prepared by the seller outlining the basis on which the seller is prepared to offer the shares or assets for sale. This also applies in England and Wales where the target is being offered for sale by way of an auction.

#### Disclosure Letter

Prepared by the seller's lawyers. The purpose of the document is to disclose matters relating to the target and its affairs which, if undisclosed, would result in the seller being in breach of warranty.

Documents referred to n the letter are attached – the “disclosure bundle”.

The disclosure letter may be written by the seller or by the seller’s lawyers. In the latter case it should incorporate an appropriate disclaimer that all information has been provided by the client and that the lawyers accept no responsibility for its contents. The letter is handed to the buyer at the same time as the parties enter into the sale and purchase agreement.

The disclosure letter is itself a negotiated document; the buyer may try to negotiate a price reduction/ specific indemnities as a result of the disclosures listed.

### Pre-completion

Completion normally takes place immediately after SPA is signed. But there may be a gap, with completion conditional on certain events. Buyer will want to ensure that there is no change in the general state of the assets/ the company.

### Completion

Title to the assets which are the subject of the acquisition is formally transferred by the seller to the buyer in return for the buyer paying the purchase price/ consideration.

Share sale in E&W:

- Seller's lawyers will hand over signed stock transfer forms
- Completion board meeting of the target company to deal with resignation/ appointment of directors and approval of share transfers.
- Method of completion usually a clause in the SPA.
- Documents to be executed at completion will be referred to in the SPA as being in the “agreed form”. Will often be annexed/ contained in schedules.

Asset sale:

- Individual assets transferred in the appropriate way
- Land included must be transferred by deed
- Assignment of IP rights is necessary
- Goodwill and the benefit of contracts may need to be formally assigned.

### Post-completion

Buyer's lawyer ensures that:

- Stock transfer forms duly stamped
- Internal registers of the target company are updated to reflect changes in members and directors
- Appropriate information filed at Companies House.
- Land Registry registrations.
- Steps to incorporate acquired assets into the existing business organisation.

## Pre-contractual Documentation

Target company or assets must be investigated and the terms of proposed SPA negotiated.

### Confidentiality Agreement

Initial draft usually prepared by seller/ seller's advisers, since the seller is most exposed to potential release of information. Generally a standard format is used, but there may be scope for negotiation. Buyer will seek to reduce restrictions imposed, especially those costing money.

Will generally include:

- Definition of confidential information
- Obligation on the buyer not to disclose or use such information except for authorised purposes in connection with the acquisition. Buyer may be prevented from soliciting customers, suppliers or employees of the target for a specified period.
- Undertaking by the buyer to return or destroy such information if the acquisition does not proceed.
- Agreement that the parties will not make any announcement or disclosure of the fact negotiations have taken place.

Often undertakings contained in a letter to the seller. Consideration must be given: this is usually the provision by the seller of the confidential information.

A confidentiality agreement provides comfort to a seller who is in a commercially sensitive position. May prove difficult for the seller to monitor breaches and assess loss. So important to specify monitoring procedures. For extremely sensitive information, do not disclose until exchange of contracts.

French law: no agreement can last for an indefinite period. So the agreement must stipulate a period for which the information is confidential.

Liquidated damages clauses usually drafted in confidentiality agreements. Common to agree a fixed amount for a breach.

### Heads of Agreement

Aims:

- Focuses the minds of parties
- Establish whether there are significant areas of agreement to make it worth continuing.

Not universally employed in acquisitions. Two main issues with heads of agreement:

1. Whether the terms are legally binding
2. Whether the buyer is granted an exclusive right to bargain with the seller.

#### Legally Binding

The intention is almost always for the heads of agreement **not** to be legally binding; the buyer will want to first conduct a detailed investigation of the target.

Normal practice is for the Heads of Agreement to be marked "subject to contract" and to include a statement that the provisions are not intended to be legally binding.

Often some clauses should be legally binding, e.g., those relating to confidentiality, exclusivity of bargaining and liability for costs in the event of an abortive transaction.

#### Civil Law Position

In Continental European civil law jurisdictions, it is possible to enter into an agreement to agree. A Heads of Agreement may be construed by courts as a binding pre-agreement. A binding contract can be avoided through careful drafting, though in some jurisdictions the contents of the letter as a whole and the subsequent conduct of parties is considered when assessing whether it is legally binding.

Most of Continental Europe imposes a general duty to negotiate in good faith: *culpa in contrahendo*. This extends to all commercial relationships, including pre-contractual ones. So even if a heads of agreement is not legally binding, it may establish a duty of good faith between the parties.

The duty of good faith usually includes obligations:

1. to inform each other where reasonable of all points which, if known by the other party, might be expected to lead it to change its views on material aspects of the transaction;
2. to observe reasonable diligence in the performance of pre-contractual obligations; and
3. to observe ethical standards of behaviour.

This could be breached by, e.g., withdrawing from negotiations without reasonable justification. The obligations can often be excluded by including, e.g., an express right of either party to terminate negotiations at any stage without incurring any obligations or liability. The remedy is usually damages based on the reliance interest (put the party back in the position they would have been had negotiations not taken place) – so legal fees etc. paid.

But in Germany and the Netherlands, can claim damages for loss of opportunity in certain circumstances.

#### Exclusivity

A buyer may be reluctant to spend time and money undertaking a full investigation into the target unless granted an exclusive bargaining right for a certain period. An agreement not to negotiate with anyone else (“lock-out agreements”) for a fixed period is enforceable provided it is sufficiently certain ([[Walford v Miles [1992] 2 WLR 174]]). But held in that case that agreements to negotiate in good faith (“lock-in agreements”), even those with a time-limit, are unenforceable because they are too uncertain.

> [!important]
> An undertaking for a limited period of time to negotiate in good faith can be enforceable if the obligation is sufficiently certain. In [[Petromec Inc Petro Deep Societa Armanmento SpA v Petroleo Brasilerio SpA [2005] EWCA Civ 891]], held that an undertaking to to ‘negotiate in good faith’ on costs, set out in a formally negotiated document as part a series of binding contracts, was enforceable. This obligation was held not to be inconsistent with the ruling in Walford as the obligation was narrow in context, the terms were objectively ascertainable and it was part of a series of binding agreements.

The exclusivity clause should include a remedy in the event of a breach; usually the recovery of costs incurred in pursuing the acquisition. Unclear whether costs incurred before the execution of the lock-out agreement would be covered by such a provision. The English case of [[Radiant Shipping Co and Sea Containers [1995] CLC 976]] provided that costs incurred before the execution of the agreement could be recovered if this was expressly provided for, as long as it did not amount to a penalty.

The usual consideration for the exclusivity clause is the buyer's commitment to finance the due diligence investigation.

Need:

1. Time certainty
2. Consideration for the promise
3. Framed as a lock-out clause.

> [!action]
> - Express exclusivity clause as an agreement not to negotiate with anyone else for a fixed period. 
> - Provision for the remedy should allow for the recovery of all expenses, whether incurred before or after execution of the exclusivity provision.

In Europe, lock-ins are acceptable in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, the duty to negotiate in good faith complicates things.

### Choice of Law

Enforceability of choice of law provisions may be subject to international or state conventions. Within the US, the validity of a choice of law provision depends on the state's choice of law rules (e.g., Delaware is strict).

In Europe:

- Rome I Regulation (Rome I) applies to contractual obligations.
	- Reinforces parties' freedom to choose the applicable law and governing jurisdiction.
	- Subject to exceptions in consumer contracts, employment contracts and insurance contracts.
	- Article 3(1) states the right of the parties to choose the law which governs a contract but provides, under Article 3(3), that where all other elements at the time of the choice are located in a country other than the country whose law has been chosen, the choice of the parties will not prejudice the provisions of the law of that other country which cannot be derogated from by agreement.
	- So there should be some connection to the jurisdiction chosen.
- Rome II Regulation (Rome II) applies to non-contractual obligations.
	- Applies to all EU countries except Denmark.
	- A provision on the choice of law may determine the rules applicable to the relationship between the parties even before the contract is formally binding.
