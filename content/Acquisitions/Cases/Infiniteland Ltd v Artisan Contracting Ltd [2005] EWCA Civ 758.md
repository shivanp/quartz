# Infiniteland Ltd v Artisan Contracting Ltd [2005] EWCA Civ 758

In the circumstances, where the claimants had sought damages for breach of warranty arising out of a share sale agreement in respect of three companies, the judge had been entitled to find that the warranty had been qualified by the disclosure in relation to the claimant's knowledge of an exceptional item which had affected the operational profit shown in one company's profit and loss account, and that there had been no breach of warranty as so qualified.

## Summary

The effect of the terms of a disclosure letter accompanying a share sale agreement was that the disclosure requirement was satisfied in relation to such matters as might fairly be expected to come to the knowledge of the reporting accountants from due diligence examination of the documents supplied.

## Abstract

The appellants (C) appealed against a decision ([2004] EWHC 955) dismissing their claim for damages for breach of a share sale agreement and breach of warranty. The agreement was for the sale of the shares in three companies. The vendor (D) gave a number of warranties in clause 7 of the agreement. The agreement was accompanied by a disclosure letter making general and specific disclosures. C paid the first instalment of the balance of the purchase price, but before it had paid the second instalment, one of the companies (Bickerton) that C had purchased went into insolvent liquidation. C brought proceedings claiming that there had been a breach of warranty in that Bickerton's accounts had showed a trading profit when they should have shown a loss and a breach of the share sale agreement based on alleged overvaluation in the accounts of construction contracts that Bickerton was undertaking.

The judge held that C's investigating accountant knew that the accounts were misleading in that the profit and loss account of Bickerton required adjustment, and that D could rely on the accountant's knowledge to defeat the warranty claim because his “actual knowledge” was to be imputed to C under clause 7.4 of the agreement. The judge further held that the disclosure letter and documents to which it referred did not make adequate disclosure of the respects in which Bickerton's profit and loss account did not give a true and fair view. The judge held that in any event, no “principal accounts” as required by the agreement were in existence when the warranties were given. The judge dismissed the contracts valuation claim on the basis that although the contracts had been overvalued, C had failed to invoke the net asset value adjustment procedure in accordance with its terms.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) there was ample evidence to support the judge's finding that the investigating accountant knew that the accounts were misleading in respect of the trading profits of Bickerton and needed to be adjusted.

(2) The judge was wrong to hold that the disclosure letter and documents to which it referred did not make adequate disclosure, _[New Hearts Ltd v Cosmopolitan Investments Ltd [1997] 2 B.C.L.C. 249, [1996] 3 WLUK 121](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7AAF80E0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bfc7e211377f4846a516225c86dca4f1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. The disclosure letter was written in the context that documents and other written material had been supplied to reporting accountants engaged by C to carry out due diligence in advance of the proposed purchase. C did not stipulate for disclosure specific to each individual warranty. It was content to rely on its accountants identifying from the documents disclosed the matters about which it needed to be informed. The disclosure requirement was satisfied in relation to such matters as might fairly be expected to come to the knowledge of the reporting accountants from due diligence examination of the documents supplied. There was ample material in those documents and in the specific disclosure to indicate that the amount of profits had been overstated. The warranty that the accounts gave a true and fair view was qualified by the disclosure made in the disclosure letter, and on that basis there was no breach of warranty.

(3) It was not necessary to decide whether the judge was right in his construction of clause 7.4.

(4) The judge was wrong to rely on the no principal accounts point as an answer to the warranty claims.

(5) The judge was right to reach the conclusion he did on the contracts valuation issue. The instant case was not one in which the contractual machinery could fairly be said to have broken down, but one in which C had failed to take the steps which it was required to take under the contract in order to establish its entitlement to an adjustment of the consideration, _[Gillatt v Sky Television Ltd (formerly Sky Television Plc) [2000] 1 All E.R.
