# Employment and Regulatory Concerns

## Employees

Common law: an employer is free to offer employment to whoever they choose ([[Allen v Flood and Taylor [1898] AC 1]]). This is restricted by statute; the employer may not discriminate against a person on obvious grounds (race, sex, religion, sexual orientation, disability etc.).

s 39 Equality Act 2010: unlawful to discriminate in recruitment, employment terms, opportunities for promotion and training, dismissal etc. Protected characteristics listed in s 4.

Types of discrimination:

1. Direct discrimination (s 13)
2. Indirect discrimination (s 19)
3. Harassment (s 26)
4. Victimisation (s 27).

### Written Statement of Terms

s 1 Employment Rights Act 1996: the employer must, within 2 months of employment, give the employee a written statement of terms and conditions. This should include:

- Identity of parties
- Commencement date
- Remuneration details
- Hours of work
- Holiday, sick pay, pensions
- Notice required
- Job description, etc.

### Employee Obligations

Statutory obligations to employees include

- Allowing employees time off work
	- Ante-natal care
	- Trade union duties
	- Public duties
	- Maternity, paternity, adoption and parental leave
	- Caring for dependents
- Allowing employees to sometimes request flexible working
- Allowing an employee to return after maternity leave
- Reasonable care of employees' health and safety at work.

### Informing and Consulting

Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/3426): employees of companies with $\geq 50$ employees have the right to be informed and consulted about certain key decisions.

### Dismissal of Employees

Potential claims include the common law claim for wrongful dismissal and statutory claims of unfair dismissal and claim for a statutory redundancy payment.

### Wrongful Dismissal

> [!important]
> Likely to apply if the employer terminates a contract for an indefinite term with no notice/ inadequate notice, or if a fixed-term contract is terminated before its expiry date.

Most employment contracts are for an indefinite term and terminable, by either side giving correct contractual notice.

In a fixed-term contract, the contract is not usually terminable by notice. In the case of a fixed-term contract without a break clause, termination of the contract prior to its expiry date will be a breach of contract and the employee may claim wrongful dismissal.

#### Notice Period

- The applicable notice period will usually be expressly agreed in the contract.
- If an expressly agreed notice period is shorter than the statutory minimum required by **s 86 ERA 1996**, the longer statutory period must be given.
- If there is no express provision, there is an implied term that the employee is entitled to **reasonable notice**
- For more senior employees, a longer period will be implied.
- But any implied period is still subject to the s 86 minimum.

> [!test] s 86 ERA 1996 notice period
> For time of continuous employment $T$, the statutory minimum notice period is $P$ weeks, where:
> 
> $P = \begin{cases}  
> 1 , & \text{if } 1 \text{ month} \leq T < 2 \text{ years}\\  
> T , & \text{if } 2 \text{ years} \leq T < 13 \text{ years},\\  
> 12, & \text{if } T \geq 13 \text{ years}  
> \end{cases}  
> $
> 

A claim for wrongful dismissal requires a dismissal in breach of contract.

Where an employee resigns, they will have no claim. If they resign without sufficient notice/ terminate before the expiry date of a fixed-term contract, the employee will be in breach.

#### Repudiatory Breach

If the employer has committed a repudiatory breach of contract, the employee is entitled to treat the contract as discharged. They can leave with or without notice and bring a claim for wrongful dismissal, since they have been “**constructively dismissed**” by breach of contract.

The employee must leave within a reasonable period of the employer's breach, otherwise they will be deemed to have affirmed the contract.

[[Repudiatory breach]] can be caused by:

- Unilaterally altering the employee's contract
- Breaching an implied duty of good faith towards employees
	- e.g., imposing unreasonable work demands on the employee, publicly humiliating them.
- Employee revealing confidential information/ wilfully disobeying orders.
	- So it is a defence available to an employer in a wrongful dismissal claim that the employee committed a repudiatory breach of an express or implied term of the contract
	- Defence available even if the employer did not know of the employee's breach at the time of termination of the contract.

#### Damages

- Damages for wrongful dismissal are damages for breach of contract.
- The aim is to put the employee in **the position they would have been in**, so far as money can do this, had the contract not been broken.
- Starting point is the salary/ wages which would have been earned during the proper notice period/ remainder of the fixed term.
- Damages for other fringe benefits can also be claimed (e.g., pension rights, use of a company car).
- Damages will not be awarded for loss of future prospects/ injured feelings.
- The employee is under a duty to mitigate their loss (by applying for other jobs).
- Claim can be brought in the High Court/ County Court/ Employment Tribunal.
- Where an employer has made a payment in lieu of damages, this will be deducted from any damages.
- Restriction of £25,000 on tribunal awards.

### Unfair Dismissal

- s 94 ERA 1996: an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed.
- Claim before employment tribunal
- Employee must prove
	- They are a “qualifying employee” (2 years' continuous employment ending with the effective date of termination). — s 108 ERA 1996
	- They have been dismissed
		- Includes actual and constructive (repudiatory breach of employment contract) dismissal.
- Burden of proof moves to the employer
	- must show that the reason for the dismissal was one of 5 permitted reasons:
		1. **Capability** or qualifications of the employee for doing work of the kind employed to do
		2. **Conduct** of the employee
		3. Employee was **redundant**
		4. **Illegality – employee could not continue to work without contravening a statutory enactment (e.g., bus driver losing driving licence)
		5. Some **other substantial reason** (e.g., personality clash between employees).
- s 98(4) ERA 1996: if employer demonstrates a fair reason, the tribunal must decide whether in the circumstances, the employer acted reasonably.
- Any procedural defects will be considered
	- In capability cases, the employer should have warned the employee about their standard of work.
	- In conduct cases, the employer should allow the employee to state their case.
		- Guidance on how to deal with misconduct is given by (non-binding) ACAS Code of Practice.
	- It's not "last in, first out".

#### Remedies

- Reinstatement
	- Being given same job back
- Re-engagement
	- Being given another comparable/ suitable job with the same/ an associated employer.
- Compensation
	- Basic award
		- Calculated by reference to a statutory formula, including age, pay and length of service.
		- $\text{Final gross weekly pay} \times \text{multiplier}$
		- Final gross weekly pay subject to a maximum of £571.
		- Multiplier is, for age of employee $E$:
			- 0.5 for years worked $E<22$
			- 1 for years worked $22\leq E < 41$
			- 1.5 for $E \geq 42$
		- If you work for 20 years, statutory maximum is ~£17,000.
	- Compensatory award
		- A further amount as the tribunal considers just and equitable, considering:
			- Loss of immediate and future wages,
			- Loss of fringe benefits,
			- Loss of statutory protection.
		- Maximum of £93,878, excluding fringe benefits.
		- Adjusted up/down by $\leq 25\%$ if either party unreasonably failed to follow ACAS recommended code of discipline and grievance.
		- Unfair compensatory award capped at lower of 52 weeks' pay and £93,878.

### Redundancy

If the employer does not pay a redundancy payment, or the employee disputes the calculation, the employee may refer the matter to an employment tribunal (within a 6-month time limit).

#### Conditions

To claim a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must prove:

1. Dismissal – actually, constructively or by failure to renew a fixed-term contract
2. 2 years' continuous employment

This raises a **presumption** that they have been dismissed for **redundancy**. An employee may be show a reason other than redundancy, but then this may lead to a claim for unfair dismissal.

> [!defn] Redundancy
> s 139 ERA 1996: redundancy involves either:
> 1. Complete closedown of the business
> 2. Partial closedown of the business
> 3. Overmanning or a change in the type of work undertaken.

Upon fulfilling this definition, an employee may have a prima facie entitlement to a redundancy payment. An employee may lose their entitlement if they unreasonably refuse an offer of suitable alternative employment.

#### Amount

Statutory redundancy payment, calculated in the same way as the basic award for unfair dismissal.

### Overlapping Claims

Multiple claims may be made, depending on the circumstances. If multiple claims against the employer are successful: compensation should not be awarded for the same loss twice.

#### Discriminatory Dismissals

If an employer unlawfully discriminates when dismissing an employee, the employee can claim uncapped compensation, which can include compensation for injured feelings.

### Settlement Agreements

Many complaints are agreed, usually because the employer pays the employee a sum of money.

| Statute        | Details                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| s 203 ERA 1996 | Any provision in an agreement is void so far as it seeks to exclude or limit ERA 1996, or to stop someone bringing proceedings |
| s 18  ERA 1996 | Someone can be stopped from bringing proceedings if a settlement agreement has been entered into.                                                                                                                               |

For a settlement to be binding:

1. In writing, identify adviser, relate to complaint and state the relevant statutory conditions are satisfied.
2. Employee/ worker must have received advice from a relevant independent adviser as to the terms and effects of the proposed agreement.
3. Must be a contract of insurance or an indemnity provided.

s 203 ERA 1996: must relate only to the matter in dispute and cannot purport to exclude all possible claims.

### Directors and Members

A director or shareholder can also be an employee of the company ([[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Bottril [2000] 1 All ER 915]]). If a director is awarded a service contract for a fixed term exceeding 2 years, the members must approve by ordinary resolution → if not, the contract is terminable on **reasonable notice**.
