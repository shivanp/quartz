# Completion

SPA is a contractual agreement setting out the acquisition terms. On exchange, the parties undertake to perform the agreed steps to transfer legal interest in the shares/ assets. Usually, exchange and completion are simultaneous.

| Stage                | Details                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signing and exchange | The parties make a legal commitment to proceed with the transaction by delivering their signed share purchase agreement to the other party by way of exchange |
| Completion/ closing  | The necessary formalities to conclude the transaction are performed. For example, the seller delivers a duly executed stock transfer form for the target shares and the buyer pays the purchase price to the seller                                                                                                                                                                             |

It is usual for the SPA to set out the details of each party's completion obligations.

## Reasons for Conditionality

Approvals, consents and clearances should ideally be obtained before signing of the SPA, but can take time. SPA may be made conditional on:

1. HMRC clearance (e.g., on roll-over relief from capital tax on a securities exchange)
2. CMA notification that buyer will not be subject to a Phase 2 investigation
3. Regulatory licence for the industry (e.g., environmental licence)
4. a substantial customer or landlord providing its consent to an assignment/ confirming it will not exercise a contractual right to terminate.
5. Corporate buyer shareholders passing a resolution for the issue of shares in consideration for the target.
6. Clearance under National Security and Investment Act 2021.

Parties may not want to make the required applications (and make the deal public) until after the contract is signed.

## Risk Allocation on Conditional Contracts

If completion is to be made conditional, the agreement must state:

- Each party's obligations
- Date by which each condition must be met
- Any right to terminate prior to completion.

The buyer will seek a contractual right to withdraw from the purchase if a major problem occurs prior to completion.

### Conditions Precedent

Typical CPs include:

1. An obligation on one party to take all reasonable steps to try to procure the satisfaction of the condition as early as possible
	- Implied in certain jurisdictions
2. A long-stop date by which conditions must be satisfied. If not satisfied by this date, provision for the agreement to terminate automatically without liability attaching to either party.
3. If conditions are satisfied prior to the long-stop, provision for completion within a specific period.

In France & Germany, a condition precedent may be unenforceable if its fulfilment depends solely on one party.

### Management Restrictions

After exchange of a conditional SPA, the buyer is contractually committed to proceeding with the acquisition. The buyer runs the risk that the seller may neglect the business, knowing that the buyer must go ahead with the purchase. The buyer will therefore require undertakings from the seller about how the target company or business will be run in the period between signing and completion.

The buyer runs the risk that the seller may neglect the business, knowing that the buyer must go ahead with the purchase. May:

- Require undertakings from the seller about how the target company or business will be run in the period.
- Require seller to allow it to attend board meetings
- Require undertakings that the seller will not:
	- Lend or borrow money except for routine matters in the ordinary course of business
	- Grant any mortgage/ charge/ debenture over assets
	- Settle any claim/ dispute
	- Acquire or agree to acquire any property
	- Commit to capital expenditure
	- Enter into hire purchase agreements
	- Alter employment terms of employees/ directors
	- Appoint any additional directors of the target.

### Repetition of Warranties

> [!note]
> A buyer often seeks to protect its position by requiring that the representations and warranties made in the sale and purchase agreement are repeated as at the date of completion.

A strong buyer may include this as an additional CP (giving the buyer the right to withdraw from the purchase in the event of breach). Should be strongly resisted by the seller/ limited to material breaches.

Consideration should also be given to the effect of any disclosure against such repeated warranties. The buyer is at risk in relation to disclosures made between exchange of contracts and completion because, regardless of the breach disclosed, it is still bound to complete the purchase.

### MAC Clause

In addition to the repetition of warranties, a buyer in a strong negotiating position may also seek to include a right to terminate the agreement in the event of a material adverse change in the business, assets or profits of the target.

Intended to protect the buyer against the general risk of adverse events. Should be strongly resisted by the seller (general risk should pass to the buyer on signing)/ limited to specified events.

Very standard in US transactions; unusual here. Generally interpreted narrowly in a way favouring the seller.

## Completing Acquisition

Much of the “closing” process is managed using an agreed checklist, or completion agenda. This sets out the steps and documentation required, and who is responsible for them. Regularly circulated and updated. Detail depends on the transaction.

If there is to be a delay between signing the sale and purchase agreement and completing the acquisition, the completion agenda will be an agreed document referred to in the sale and purchase agreement or set out in a schedule to it.

### Preparation

Check who should attend and that they have been correctly authorised to execute

> [!note] Power of attorney
> If an individual is unable to attend the completion meeting in person, they may execute a power of attorney giving another person the power to sign the completion documents on their behalf. The terms of the power of attorney will usually be agreed between the parties, and will often be drafted in very broad terms to include a power to sign any additional documentation that may be required in order to effect completion.

#### Seller Preparation

- Board meeting of the seller company to approve the terms of the draft SPA and to appoint an authorised signatory to execute it.
	- A single director/ committee may be appointed to attend on behalf of the company.
- A certified copy of the minutes of this meeting must be given to the buyer on completion as evidence of the seller’s representatives’ authority to act (and sign documents) on its behalf.
	- Buyer can rely on this as evidence (as a 3rd party acting in good faith)
	- Parties' lawyers will check articles of association & securities documentation regardless.
- Lawyers check whether the sale is in accordance with directors' duties.
- If sale is to a director or connected person, an ordinary resolution may be needed to approval of substantial property transaction (s 190)
- On a share sale, the buyer will require that a board meeting of the target company is held at completion to approve registration of the transfer of shares.
	- Seller should ensure BM is quorate and there is a sufficient majority.

#### Buyer Preparation

- A corporate buyer must hold a meeting to approve the terms of the draft SPA and authorise its signing and completion.
	- A single director/ committee may be appointed to attend on behalf of the company.
- A certified copy of the minutes of this meeting must be given to the buyer on completion as evidence of the buyer’s representatives’ authority to act (and sign documents) on its behalf.

| Funding of acquisition | Preparations                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equity                 | Shareholder resolutions may be required to authorise their issue. |
| Debt                   | Buyer's lawyers must confirm that requirements necessary for the provision of the finance have been complied with $\rightarrow$ funds will be available at completion.                                                                   |

- Repeat of some searches as a final check
	- Companies Registry search
	- Bankruptcy search against individual sellers
	- Trademark/ patent searches if these are important to the acquisition.
- Share acquisition: searches made against the target company itself.
- On a share purchase, the buyer may also want to inspect the statutory books of the target company to check compliance with formalities.

### Completion of Asset Acquisition

UK asset purchase: all assets must be transferred individually. SPA usually provides that transfers take place simultaneously.

#### Transfer of Title

Formalities to transfer the legal interest in the assets of a business to the buyer:

- conveyances, transfers or assignments of land and premises;
- assignments of goodwill, certain intellectual property rights (including copyrights, patents and trade marks) and the benefit of contracts.

Stock and moveable assets are transferable on delivery.

#### Documents to Hand Over

The seller will hand over:

- Where there is no delay between exchange and completion, the agreed form of disclosure letter or schedule
- where the seller is a company, a certified copy of a board resolution authorising a representative to attend to completion arrangements and to sign the documentation.
- Documents transferring title to assets
- Deeds and documents of title to the assets
- Duly executed releases of charges over the assets and confirmation of non-crystallisation of floating charges
- Financial records, customer records, promo materials, PAYE and VAT records, employee records…
	- Seller should retain a right to inspect these for a while after completion (in case needed)
- Originals, counterparts or certified copies as appropriate of licences to assign leasehold property, novation agreements and consents from third parties to assignment of contracts
- A certified copy of a special resolution of the selling company resolving to change its name if it has been agreed that the buyer will acquire the right to use the seller’s corporate name.

### Completion of Share Acquisition

Parties agree a completion timetable. Only the shares are transferred.

> [!note] Transferring a legal interest in shares
> Under English law, the following documents are required to transfer the legal interest in the shares:
>  ( a) stock transfer form; and
>  ( b) share certificate.

The buyer is not entitled to exercise its shareholders' rights until the transfer is registered by the target. The buyer will therefore require the seller to procure registration of the transferred shares, usually (in a private company) by procuring a board meeting of the target company to consider the transferred shares for registration. The existing shareholders may also be required to waive any rights of pre-emption on the transfer of shares that may exist under the constitution of the company.

#### Completion Board Meeting

Board meeting to implement any decisions the buyer requires to take immediate control of the target. The minutes of this meeting must be prepared in advance and circulated for approval.

The meeting usually deals with:

- Approval of the transfer of shares (subject to stamp duty)
- Appointment of new directors and company secretary (consents to act, disclosure of interests, service contracts)
- Acceptance of resignations of directors and company secretary.
- Acceptance of resignation of company's auditors and appointment of new auditors.
- Change in accounting reference date
- Change in registered office
- Alteration of existing bank mandates and completion of new finance arrangements.

> [!note]
> A seller of shares is under a general duty not to obstruct or delay the registration of the buyer as the holder of the shares (_[Hooper v Herts [1906] 1 Ch 549](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-106-5776?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_). However, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise, the seller is not obliged to procure that the target company actually approves and registers the transfer (_[London Founders Association Ltd v Clarke [1888] 20 QBD 576](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-106-5778?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_). As a result, the buyer typically includes a provision in the SPA which requires the seller to procure that the target company holds a board meeting at completion for the purpose of approving the transfer of the target shares to the buyer, subject only to the transfer being stamped.

Subsidiaries may also need board meetings to implements changes.

#### Completion GM

Matters that may require shareholder approval:

- Consent to SPT (s 190)
- Consent to directors' service contract $> 2$ years
- Consent to alter company articles.

Changes/ approvals to be effected by the shareholders will usually be dealt with by written resolution at the completion board meeting of the target company.

> [!note]
> The buyer does not become a member of the target company until its name is entered into the register of members (CA 2006, s 112) – after stamping of the stock transfer form. So the sellers must usually pass the resolution. 

#### Completion Documents

The parties will agree a completion agenda. Usually, the buyer takes responsibility for producing the final form SPA. Seller required to hand over:

- where there is no delay between exchange and completion, the **agreed form of disclosure letter** or schedule;
- if the seller is a company, a certified copy of a **board resolution authorising its representative** to attend to completion arrangements on behalf of the company and to sign the documentation;
- **stock transfer form** duly executed and delivered by each seller together with relevant share certificates;
	- A proper instrument of transfer is required to transfer legal title to the target shares to the buyer (s 770 CA 2006).
	- For fully paid shares, this is almost always the form prescribed by Sch 1 Stock Transfer Act 1963.
- minutes of a **completion board meeting** of the target to implement any specified board decisions if required;
- any **written resolutions** required, duly executed by the sellers
- **discharge of outstanding loans** made by the seller to the company/ vice versa
	- Deed of release of the charge
	- Letter of non-crystallisation of a floatng charge
	- Written consent of the charge holder to the sale of shares.
- statutory books of the target company (if required), title deeds to its properties, any certificates of title, documents of title for other assets, financial records, contracts, insurance policies etc.
- **Officers' and auditor's letters of resignation** if required by buyer
- **Deed of indemnity for lost share certificates** if any lost/ destroyed.
- **Power of attorney pending registration of the transfer** – allows the buyer to control the rights attached to the target shares pending registration of the transfer.
- **Waiver of seller's claim**s – waiver of any subsisting claims against the target, if required by the buyer.
- **Loan note documents** if a loan note is used to fund the transaction
- **Transitory services agreement** – if the buyer requires the seller to continue to provide certain support/ services for a limited period following completion.
- **New services agreement** for employees, if required by the buyer.

Buyer pays the purchase price on completion.

### Virtual Completion

If completion is not face to face, take care to ensure legal validity. Ensure that final versions of all documentation are sent to signatories before completion occurs, so the signatories can subsequently give authority for signed pages to be attached to a hard copy.

Historically, the non-availability of a signatory for an exchange or completion meeting might have been addressed by arranging for the absent signatory to sign separate signature pages in advance, and then attaching the pre-signed pages to the relevant documents once they were finalised. However, this practice has been curtailed following the High Court decision in [[R (Mercury Tax Group Ltd and another) v HMRC [2008] EWHC 2721 (Admin)]].

> [!action] Recommended options for virtual completion: JWP note
> 
> - **Option 1.** The signatory prints and signs the relevant signature page of the final version of the document. They then return a single email to their lawyers attaching both the entire final version of the document and a scanned copy of the signed signature page. This approach is suitable for all types of documents, including deeds.
> 
> - **Option 2.** The signatory prints and signs the relevant signature page of the final version of the document. They then return to their lawyers a scanned copy of the signed signature page only and authorise them to attach the signed page to the final version of the document. This approach is **not** suitable for deeds or real estate contracts.
> 
> - **Option 3.** The signatory pre-signs a signature page for the relevant document. They then returns this page to their lawyers to attach to the document once the final version is agreed. This approach is **not** suitable for deeds or real estate contracts.

When a party signs a document and sends this to their lawyer in advance of exchange or completion, they should give or confirm in writing the authority to deliver the relevant signed document, clearly stating any conditions.

### Authorising Execution

Where all required signatories cannot be physically present at exchange or completion, rather than signing the transaction documents in advance, the absent signatories could authorise another person to execute documents on their behalf.

2 options:

1. Authorising the third party to sign as the party's agent.
2. Granting an ordinary power of attorney. This approach tends to be more common in practice and will be the only viable option if the transaction documents include a deed, given that authority to execute a deed must be given by deed ([[Steiglitz v Eggington [1815] Holt 141]]).

> [!warning]
> It is not usually possible for an absent director to appoint an attorney to sign a document on their behalf in their capacity as a director of a company.

### Payment Arrangements

The seller will expect the buyer to pay any cash element of the transaction in cleared funds on the completion date. Check:

- The buyer has the requisite funds
- The parties have agreed a completion funds flow dealing with logistics.
- Agree timings in advance, or they can be a pain
- Consider having the buyer's lawyer undertake that funds will be transferred on completion.
- Consider setting up a special purpose escrow account in the parties' joint names and appointing a holding bank/ independent third agent as the escrow agent.

#### Using Sale Proceeds to Discharge Security Interests

Where a seller needs the sale proceeds to discharge a security interest at completion, this can cause cash flow issues.

> [!action]
> The lender's lawyers giving an undertaking to the buyer's lawyers to forward the lender's deed of release to them once the lender has received the monies following completion of the share sale may resolve this timing issue.

### Funding Acquisition

If a buyer is seeking to raise the requisite funds for the acquisition through an issue of equity or by obtaining debt finance, this can cause timing issues for completion:

> [!note] Catch-22
> - The buyer may not want to raise funds unless acquisition is certain to complete. 
> - Buyer unable to complete the transaction if it does not raise the necessary funds $\rightarrow$ wants to avoid being subject to an obligation to complete in these circumstances. 

- Acquisition funded by a placing
	- SPA often provides that completion is conditional on the allotment and listing of placing shares
	- Placing agreement says placing conditional on SPA becoming unconditional in all respects other than placing conditions
- Acquisition funded by rights issue
	- Buyer risks raising too much cash if the acquisition is subject to a condition that cannot be satisfied before the rights issue is launched.
	- Agree that if the acquisition does not complete, proceeds of the rights issue can be used for other purposes
	- Or pay in 2 instalments("trombone rights issue")

## Post-completion

### Stamp Duty and Filing

> [!important]
> On a share purchase of a company registered in England and Wales, the buyer’s lawyers must ensure that the duly executed stock transfer forms are delivered to the HMRC Stamp Office within **30 days** together with the requisite transfer duty.

Usually done immediately by the buyer's lawyers. Stamp duty is payable on the transfer of certificated shares unless the consideration for the transfer is £1,000 or less, or another exemption applies.

The buyer's lawyers may also need to file the following at Companies Registry:

- Forms notifying any change of registered office (s 87 CA 2006), directors and secretary, accounting reference period:
	- Change of registered office address (_[Form AD01](https://uk.westlaw.com/7-422-1650?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_).
	- Appointment of new director(s) (_[Forms AP01](https://uk.westlaw.com/9-422-1649?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_ and _[AP02](https://uk.westlaw.com/2-422-2044?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_).
	- Appointment of new company secretary (_[Forms AP03](https://uk.westlaw.com/1-422-1648?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_ and _[AP04](https://uk.westlaw.com/4-422-2043?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_).
	- Resignation of director(s) (_[Form TM01](https://uk.westlaw.com/3-422-1647?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_).
	- Resignation of company secretary (_[Form TM02](https://uk.westlaw.com/6-422-2042?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_).
	- Change of accounting reference date (_[Form AA01](https://uk.westlaw.com/0-422-1291?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=499185a9ecb940b1a3a505768c861e1b)_).
- Copy of any special resolution
- Copy of new articles of association.

Where shares are issued as consideration, the buyer's lawyers may also need to file:

- Ordinary resolution triggering the directors' authority to allot shares under s 550
- Ordinary resolution removing ceiling on authorised share capital (CA 1985 company)
- Ordinary resolution authorising directors to allot shares (s 551) – a company other than a private company with only one class of shares in issue
- Special resolution suspending any pre-emption rights
- Return of allotments (s 555) together with a statement of capital.

Internal administration:

- Update register of members (section 128B, CA 2006) after stock transfer forms signed
- Register of people with significant control (section 790X, CA 2006).
- Register of directors (section 167A, CA 2006).
- Register of directors' residential addresses (section 167A, CA 2006).
- Register of secretaries (section 279A, CA 2006).
- PSC register
- Maintain internal record of board minutes and resolutions.

### Outstanding Matters

There are often matters that may have been left outstanding on completion of a transaction. Agree a timetable for these and consider having indemnities in place in relation to any costs incurred. Take practical steps to implement any changes required to incorporate the target into the existing business.

#### Bibles

Often compiled after completion, containing a complete set of documents used in the acquisition.

## Execution of Deeds and Documents

English law makes a distinction between deeds and simple contracts. Execution formalities vary according to the legal personality of the executing party.

- The default position in English law favours flexibility.
- Formalities are imposed where a transaction is considered sufficiently important.
- A signatory to a contract is generally bound by its terms (in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation) irrespective of whether the party has in fact read the terms (_[L’Estrange v Graucob [1934] 2 KB 394](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-016-1583?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac)_).
- English law mandates the use of a deed in certain transactions or circumstances. There is no requirement for the signature to be witnessed.
- A deed is a written instrument which is executed with the necessary formality and by which an interest/ right or property passes or is confirmed.

Purposes of deed formalities:

- Evidential
- Cautionary
- Labelling

### Effect of a Deed

- No requirement for consideration.
	- But note the courts will not normally order specific performance of a voluntary undertaking even if it made by deed (equity does not assist a volunteer).
- Longer limitation period
	- Generally 12 years (s 8 Limitation Act 1980), except for some rent/ mortgage exceptions.
	- For a contract, limitation period is 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (s 5 Limitation Act 1980)
- Estoppel by deed
	- A party is estopped from disputing the validity or effectiveness of the grant.

### Written Contract

In a limited number of situations, the law requires an agreement to be made or evidenced in writing and, in some instances, to be signed by the parties in order to have legal effect.

- Contract for the sale of land
	- s 2 LP(MP)A applies; must be in writing, signed by or on behalf of each party, and incorporate all terms expressly agreed by the parties.
- The assignment of the benefit of a contract
	- An assignment that meets the requirements set out in _[section 136](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/2-505-5703?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac)_ of the LPA 1925 is a legal assignment
	- These include that the assignment must be in writing and signed by the assignor.  
- Transfer of legal title to certificated shares
	- s 770 CA 2006 requires a written transfer signed by or on behalf of the transferor to be lodged with the company before the new shareholder is registered as the owner of the legal title to the shares.
- Assignment of a number of IP rights
- Equitable mortgage
- Assent (legal interest in land)
- Guarantee
	- Guarantee is unenforceable unless (s 4 Statute of Frauds) -
		- It is in writing (or there is a memorandum or note of the agreement).
		- It is signed by the guarantor or at its direction.
	- Usually structured as deeds to avoid the problem of consideration.
- Declaration of trust over land (or any interest in it)
- Financial collateral arrangement
- Regulated credit agreement (Consumer Credit Act 1974)
- Agreement to waive/ settle a claim against the employer in return for payment.

### Deed

Statute demands the use of a deed for the following transactions:

- Transfers of land or interests in land.
	- Must be by deed or it will be void for the purpose of conveying/ creating a legal estate (s 52 LPA 1925).
- Leases, except
	- Those taking effect in possession for a term not exceeding 3 years at best rent reasonably obtainable without taking a fine.
	- Relevant social housing tenancies.
- Mortgages and charges.
	- A legal mortgage or charge by way of legal mortgage over land can only be created by deed (sections 52(2), 85(1) and 86(1), LPA 1925).
	- Any mortgage or charge of land or other property (whether legal or equitable) must be by deed if the mortgagee or chargee is to have the statutory powers of sale and to appoint a receiver (section 101, LPA 1925).
- Sales by mortgagee.
	- Must be by deed if the sale is to overreach subsequent mortgages and charges (section 104, LPA 1925).
- Certain actions under the Trustee Act 1925 (TA 1925).
	- The power to replace a trustee under section 36 of the TA 1925 must be exercised in writing and is typically exercised by deed, because a deed allows automatic vesting of trust property under section 40(1).
- Powers of attorney, including lasting powers of attorney.
	- An ordinary power of attorney must be executed as a deed by the donor of the power (section 1(1), Powers of Attorney Act 1971).
- Bills of sale.

Common law requires a deed for:

- Any agreement that is made without consideration.
- A gift of tangible goods, without delivery of possession
	- (_[Irons v Smallpiece (1819) 2 B&E Ald 551](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-016-1484?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac)_ and _[Cochrane v Moore (1890) 25 QBD 57](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-016-1485?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac)_).
- An express release of certain rights..

### Principles

> [!important]

However, a variation or release can take effect in equity in the absence of a deed provided that valuable consideration has been given (_[Webb v Hewitt (1857) 3 K and J 438](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-009-7407?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac)_).

The doctrine of promissory estoppel is also relevant in this context and oral evidence is also permissible to show a variation of the terms of a deed.

### Formalities

There are four key requirements for a valid deed:

- **Writing.** A deed must be in writing. This is a common law requirement modified by section 1(1)(a) of the LP(MP)A 1989 which abolished any rule of law restricting the substances on which a deed may be written.
- **Face value requirement.** It must be clear from the face of the instrument that it is intended to take effect as a deed (_[section 1(2)(a)](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/7-505-7361?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac), LP(MP)A 1989_).

- **Execution.** The instrument must be validly executed as a deed by the person making it or, as the case may be, by one or more of the parties to it (_[section 1(2)(b)](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/7-505-7361?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac), LP(MP)A 1989_).

- **Delivery.** A deed must be delivered. Although this was historically a common law requirement, the rule has been modified by statute (for example, _[section 1(1)(c)](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/7-505-7361?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac), LP(MP)A 1989_ and _[section 46(2)](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/0-506-8297?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=0e69ecc7bd0b425c8c07be4517611bac), CA 2006_).
