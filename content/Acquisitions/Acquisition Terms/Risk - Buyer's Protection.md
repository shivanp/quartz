# Risk - Buyer's Protection

## Protections Implied into the Contract

### Shares

On a share acquisition under English law, neither common law nor statute protects the buyer by implying terms into the contract. *Caveat emptor* applies.

In the absence of express provisions, an aggrieved buyer has very little comeback on the seller unless a misrepresentation can be established.

### Assets

The buyer of the assets of a business is not in such an exposed position, as it does not assume automatically all the liabilities of the business. The buyer may also get the benefit of some limited warranties under the Sale of Goods Act 1979 for some of the assets being transferred.

### Civil Code Jurisdictions

The buyer is seen as the party most at risk in the acquisition. Statutory warranties are implied into the terms of the acquisition. These outline the minimum protection to be provided to any buyer. Often expressed as a guarantee by the seller that individual warranty statements are true.

Civil code jurisdictions impose a duty of good faith between the parties throughout the negotiations for the proposed acquisition. Scope varies between countries. But even here, the buyer will usually seek additional contractual warranties, though these can often be looser/ wider than common law jurisdictions. Statutory warranties commonly included explicitly.

## Title Guarantee

The covenants are implied by the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994, and the alternative dispositions are sale with full title guarantee and sale with limited title guarantee.

Full title guarantee implies:

1. the seller has the **right to dispose** of the property;
2. the seller will do all it **reasonably** can, at its own expense, to pass to the buyer the **title** it purports to give; and
3. the property is free from all **charges, encumbrances and third party rights**, other than those of which the seller is unaware and could not reasonably be expected to be aware.

Limited title guarantee implies (1) and (2), and also that the seller has neither created nor allowed to be created any subsisting charge or encumbrance, and is not aware that anyone else has done so.

The type of guarantee to be given is to be negotiated. Implied covenants often modified by express provisions relating to the nature and perfection of title to the assets. The receiver or trustee selling assets may be prepared to offer no more comfort than a limited title guarantee.

## Warranties

Much of the SPA is taken up with specific warranties by the seller in favour of the buyer:

- Accounts
- Subsisting contracts
- Employees
- Pensions
- IP

The warranties are contractual statements about what is to be acquired. On a share acquisition, the warranties will include statements about the shares to be acquired.

As the warranties are terms of the contract, if they prove to be untrue, the buyer will have a claim for damages against the warrantor(s) for breach of contract.

The warranties are made about the state of the target as at a specified point. Where exchange and completion are simultaneous, the warranties will be statements given at the moment of completion.

Where there is a gap between exchange and completion, warranties are made at exchange when the parties become contractually bound, and may then be confirmed at completion.

### Damages Recoverable

In [[Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341]], loss will be recoverable if it is not too remote.

2 categories:

1. Loss which flows naturally from the breach
2. Loss which was fairly and reasonably in the contemplation of both parties.

The aim of contractual damages is to put the buyer in the position it would have been in if the contract had not been breached, subject to the duty to mitigate.

### General Principles

Application to breach of warranty:

The buyer's loss is the difference between the value of the shares if the warranty had been true and their actual value (i.e., the value of the shares with and without the breach). The basis for valuing the shares will be relevant in assessing the loss.  

> [!example]
> Where there is a breach of warranty which results in the assets of the target being less than expected, this may not have a direct effect on the value of the shares, unless they were valued on an assets-related basis.

### Pre-estimate of Damages

The parties often specify in the agreement how the loss should be quantified if certain warranties are broken. Common to include a clause specifying the appropriate multiplier for any shortfall.

There is commonly a clause obliging the seller to pay for any deficiency in assets or any undisclosed liability arising from a breach of warranty. Avoids the need to prove an equivalent diminution in the value of the shares.

Liquidated damages and penalties:

- Where the contractually agreed consequences of a breach are oppressive, the penalty rule applies ([[Cavendish Square Holdings BV v Talal El Makdessi [2015] UKSC 67]])

> [!test] *Makdessi* test
> The true test for a penalty is therefore now ‘whether the impugned provision is a secondary obligation which imposes a detriment on the contract-breaker out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the enforcement of the primary obligation’.
> 

In many civil code jurisdictions, warranties are likely to be structured as guarantees, whereby the seller guarantees that the individual warranties are correct. In the event that the object of the purchase does not meet the standards set out in the warranties, the buyer will be entitled to the remedies as set out in the sale and purchase agreement.

## Representations

If any statements which have been made by or on behalf of the seller prove to be untrue, the buyer may under common law have a claim for misrepresentation.

> [!note]
> Misrepresentation is a tort. 

### General Principles

A misrepresentation is a false statement of fact made by one party to the contract to the other, which induces the other party to enter into the contract. The usual remedies are rescission or damages.

#### Rescission

Rescission is a remedy aimed at putting the parties back into the pre-contract position.

Qualifications:

1. s 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 enables the court to award damages instead of rescission for innocent or negligent misrepresentation. The court may exercise this discretion if it feels that rescission is too drastic a remedy in the circumstances.
2. Equitable remedy and therefore subject to equitable bars
	1. Impossible to restore parties to their pre-contract position
	2. Bona fide third party rights acquired
	3. Innocent party takes action affirming the agreement
	4. Undue delay seeking relief.

#### Damages

If the misrepresentation is innocent or negligent, s 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 provides that the court ‘may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission’. This is a court discretion to award damages; no contractual right.

> [!question] Can the court still award damages in lieu of rescission if rescission itself has been lost due to one of the equitable bars?
> 
> No: [[Salt v Stratstone Specialist Ltd [2015] EWCA Civ 745]]

If the misrepresentation is negligent, the innocent party is **entitled** to damages under s 2(1). Under s 2(1), damages are measured on the tortious basis, which aims to put the innocent party in the position it would have been in if the tort had not been committed.

### Representations & Warranties

In an SPA, any representations made by the seller which induce the buyer to contract will invariably be included as warranties in the agreement.

It is rare for a claim for misrepresentation to be founded on a matter which is not included in the contract. It is common for the agreement to incorporate an acknowledgement by the buyer that it has not relied on any representations which are not contained in the contract (“non-reliance provision”) and an “entire agreement” clause.

If a clause attempts to exclude liability for misrepresentation (as is common), the exclusion must be reasonable to be effective (s 3 Misrepresentation Act 1967).

#### Entire Agreement Clause

In [[Thomas Witter Ltd v TBP Industries Ltd [1996] 2 All ER 573]] it was held that a contractual term purporting to confine the parties’ agreement to the terms of the contract will not, per se, exclude liability for misrepresentation.

To exclude liability for misrepresentation, an express exclusion provision in clear terms must be included in the contract (confirmed in [[Axa Sun Life Services plc v Campbell Martin Ltd and others [2011] EWCA Civ 133]]).

#### Non-reliance Provision

Estops the buyer from claiming that it entered into an agreement in reliance on pre-contractual statements made by the seller.

> [!question] Since non-reliance statements prevented liability for misrepresentation rather than strictly excluding it, are they subject to the reasonableness test in s 3 MA 1967?
> Yes, [[Springwell Navigation Corp v JP Morgan Chase Bank [2010] EWCA Civ 1221]]. The practical reality is excluding or restricting liability. 

To make such statements “reasonable”, it is common for the seller to ensure that the buyer confirms its non-reliance only in relation to non-fraudulent misrepresentation, with an express exclusion in relation to fraudulent misrepresentation. This is despite a House of Lords House of Lords decision in [[HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd v Chase Manhattan Bank [2003] UKHL 6]] suggesting this is not necessary. Held that ‘in the absence of words which expressly refer to dishonesty, it goes without saying that underlying the contractual arrangements of the parties will be a common assumption that the persons involved will behave honestly’.

> [!action]
> It is nevertheless considered good practice that the Buyer expressly agrees to waive its right to damages or recission only in relation to non-fraudulent misrepresentation.

#### Right of Rescission

Even when including an entire agreement clause and non-reliance clause, many representations which the seller makes to the buyer will be included as express warranties in the agreement. If any of these warranties are broken, the buyer will be able to claim damages for breach of contract.

> [!note]
> s 1 Misrepresentation Act 1967: where a misrepresentation has become a term of the contract, this will not affect the innocent party's right to rescind (provided there are no equitable bars). Could be important if the buyer becomes aware of the falsity of the representation after exchange but before completion.

If there is a gap between exchange and purchase, the buyer will usually negotiate a contractual right to withdraw from the contract if it becomes aware of any breaches of warranty. Backed up by obliging the seller to inform the buyer if it becomes aware of anything inconsistent with the warranties.

Advantage: buyer can rescind regardless of whether the breach of warranty was also a misrepresentation.

#### Damages

The difference in the measure of damages for breach of contract and misrepresentation may also be significant.

 - The contractual measure allows for loss of bargain and, on a share purchase, involves assessing the difference between the actual value of the shares and their value if the warranty had been true.
 - Tortious damages aim to put the buyer in the position it would have been in if it had not entered the agreement ("restitutionary"). Involves calculating the difference between the price paid for the shares and their market value.

Contractual measures often lead to higher damages (due to loss of bargain) but not always.

## Indemnities

A **warranty** is an undertaking by the seller that a particular state of affairs exists.

> [!defn]
> An **indemnity** is a promise to reimburse the buyer in respect of a designated type of liability which may arise in the future. 

On a share sale, the recipient of the indemnity receives an amount equal to the actual liability (+ costs and expenses).

> [!important]
> Another difference between a warranty and an indemnity is that, in the case of the latter, there is no duty to mitigate the loss; such a duty may, however, be incorporated in the contract.

- In the US, losses for breach of warranty are often qualified
- Many civil code jurisdictions do not recognise the distinction between warranties and indemnities.

### Taxation Indemnities

It is common for buyers of shares to seek protection from tax liabilities in the form of both warranties and indemnities.

- The warranties usually deal with the target’s compliance with tax and VAT requirements.
- The indemnities will cover specific tax charges which may arise over and above those provided for in the accounts.

> [!tip]
> Dealing with most tax matters by way of indemnity has the advantage to the buyer that there is no need to prove the link between the unexpected tax liability and the value of the shares.

## Who Gives

Some sellers may try to limit their share of liability. Others may be unwilling to accept any liability. The buyer will want all sellers to give warranties and indemnities both jointly and severally.

### Joint and Several Liability

- Where there is more than one warrantor the buyer will invariably insist that they accept joint and several liability.
- s 1 Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 gives the party called upon to discharge the liability the right to recover a contribution from the other warrantors who are liable in respect of the same damage.
	- The court determines the amount of the contribution recoverable from the others on the basis of what it considers just and equitable having regard to the extent of their responsibility for the particular damage (s 2).
	- Common for warrantors to agree how any liability should be borne between them to avoid uncertainty.
		- May be set out in a “deed of contribution” or incorporated into the SPA (expressed “as between the warrantors”).

Where there are a large number of selling shareholders., the buyer may not insist that they all give warranties and indemnities (minority shareholders often excluded).

### Trustees

Suppose some of the shares of a company are held in trust. Trustees will wish to avoid personal liability and may refuse to give any warranties or undertakings, other than that they have unencumbered title to the shares.

> [!action] Possible solution
> Limit the liability of trustees to the net value (after tax) of the capital of the trust. The danger to the buyer of the capital being distributed shortly after completion may be met by obliging the trustees to require any beneficiary receiving capital to give appropriate warranties to the buyer.

### Substantial Shareholders

Some powerful investors (PE funds) may avoid giving warranties and indemnities on the basis that they have no involvement with the management of the target company and cannot be expected to give promises in relation to matters they know nothing about.

> [!action]
> The role of warranties is to allocate risk between seller and buyer $\rightarrow$ the price negotiated is on the assumption that the warranties are true. So could have a deal where the shareholders who give a warranty get more cash than others. 

### Seller's Rights Against Management

Suppose there is a breach of warranty. The sellers may try to shift responsibility back onto the directors of the target. But these directors may be employed by the buyer. So the buyer may ask the selling shareholders to waive any right they may have to bring a claim against the management/ the target.

### Assigning Warranties and Indemnities

> [!guid] General rule
> The general position under English law is that, unless the contracting parties agree otherwise, the benefit of an agreement can be assigned to a third party without the consent of the other party to the contract.

- The seller is therefore likely to insist on an express provision stating that no assignment is permitted/ only permitted on approval.
- The buyer may try to negotiate with the seller an express right to assign the benefit of the warranties and indemnities.
- Common for the seller to agree to the buyer assigning the benefit of warranties and indemnities to members of its own group.

## Buyer's Security for Breach

The buyer is in an exposed position:

- Buyer or target may be directly liable to 3rd parties
- May be unable to recover the loss if the seller is in financial difficulties.
- Common to ask for security from the seller.

### Guarantees

Where the seller of a business or shares is a company which is part of a group, the seller’s parent company may be prepared to guarantee the seller’s obligations.

For a company owned by individuals, insist on guarantees from the shareholders.

### Retentions From Purchase Price

May be used to protect the buyer's position:

- Payment of the retention into a joint account in the names of the seller’s and buyer’s solicitors;
- The retention to be remitted to the seller on a certain date after completion, subject to any claims made before that date.
- Where a claim is made, the balance of the retention to be paid to the seller.
- The buyer to be paid the amount of the claim within a short period.
- Payment of accrued interest on the fund to the parties.
- An obligation on the buyer to pursue any claims against the seller which may delay the remittance of the fund promptly and diligently.
- Buyer obliged to provide full details of any claim backed up by an opinion of counsel.

The retention will not affect the capital tax position of parties (unless used to pay warranty claims).

## Restrictions on the Seller

The value of the buyer’s investment could be reduced substantially by the post-completion activities of the seller, whose detailed knowledge of the target would enable the seller to cause it considerable harm.

### No Express Restraints

[[Trego v Hunt [1896] AC 7]] established that on the sale of the goodwill of a business, the courts will refuse to imply a covenant by the seller not to set up in competition.

The only implied undertakings of the seller are:

1. Not to use or disclose confidential information relating to the business.
2. Not to represent itself as a successor to the business, or carrying on the same business.
3. Not to solicit customers of the business.

### Express Restrictions

As the seller is being paid for goodwill, the buyer is justified in seeking ways of preventing the seller from damaging it. But the buyer must go no further than is reasonably necessary to protect the goodwill of the target.

Common undertakings:

- Covenant not to be engaged or concerned in any competing business for a specified period after completion.
- Covenant not to try to solicit/ entice away from the target customers or suppliers who have recently dealt with the target, for a specified period after completion.
- Covenant not to try to solicit or entice away employees of the target for a specified period after completion.
- Undertaking not to use or disclose any confidential information about the target or its customers.
- Covenant not to use the name of the target.

### Validity at Common Law

> [!tip]
> Under English law, all covenants in restraint of trade are prima facie void at common law. However, the court will not strike down restrictive covenants which it considers to be reasonable to protect a legitimate interest of the buyer.

The court will consider:

| Consideration                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Duration** of the restraint      | 1-5 years after completion is common.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Geographical area** of restraint | If the covenant is appropriately worded, it may not be necessary to stipulate a geographical limit. If the business restricted is defined, specify a reasonable area of restriction.                 |
| **Activities** restricted          | Any attempt to extend the restrictions to activities which are not carried on by the target itself will fail, on the grounds that they are excessive in order to protect the goodwill of the target. in Ronbar Enterprises Ltd v Green [1954] 2 All ER 266, the court considered a clause preventing the seller carrying on a business ‘similar to’ that of the target to be too wide. The restriction should also be reasonable given the extent to which the party giving the covenant has been actively involved in the business. Non-solicitation clauses should not be so wide as to include those with no recent dealings with the target. |

### Enforcement

> [!question] What if only some of the restrictions are reasonable?
> If each restraint is contained in a separate clause or sub-clause and expressed to be separate and independent, they remaind independently enforceable. The court is sometimes prepared to "blue pencil" certain parts of a clause, leaving the remaining parts enforceable ([[Tillman v Egon Zehnder [2019] UKSC 32]]) though the court will not rewrite a clause to make it reasonable. 

### Competition Act 1998

Unlikely that UK courts will deviate from the European regime. There remains a general prohibition of anticompetitive agreements and a prohibition of abuse of a dominant position. If an agreement is found to breach s 2 or s 18 of the Competition Act 1998 , the agreement or (subject to severance) the anticompetitive terms will be unenforceable.

#### Anticompetitive Agreements

> [!statute] s 2 Competition Act 1998
> (1) Subject to section 3, agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices which—
> - (a) may affect trade within the United Kingdom, and
> - (b) have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the United Kingdom,
> 
> are prohibited unless they are exempt in accordance with the provisions of this Part.
> 
> (2) Subsection (1) applies, in particular, to agreements, decisions or practices which—
> - (a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;
> - (b) limit or control production, markets, technical development or investment;
> - (c) share markets or sources of supply;
> - (d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;
> - (e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.
> 
> (3) Subsection (1) applies only if the agreement, decision or practice is, or is intended to be, implemented in the United Kingdom.
> 
> (4) Any agreement or decision which is prohibited by subsection (1) is void.

N.B. any agreement that is exempt under EU law will also be exempt under UK legislation.

#### Abuse of a Dominant Position

The wording of s 18 of the 1998 Act concerning abuse of a dominant position is similar to that of Art 102 TFEU. There is a prohibition on the activities of one or more undertakings which amount to the abuse of a dominant position within the UK or a substantial part of it.

> [!statute] s 18 Competition Act 1998 - Abuse of dominant position.
> 
> (1) Subject to section 19, any conduct on the part of one or more undertakings which amounts to the abuse of a dominant position in a market is prohibited if it may affect trade within the United Kingdom.
> 
> (2) Conduct may, in particular, constitute such an abuse if it consists in—
> - (a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions;
> - (b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;
> - (c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;
> - (d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of the contracts.

#### Consequences

- Restrictions in breach of the 1998 Act will be void.
- The CMA is empowered to impose fines of up to 10% of an undertaking’s turnover.
- The parties may be ordered to cease or modify the agreement.
- CMA may conduct a dawn raid following a search warrant obtained from a High Court judge.

### EU Law

Restrictive covenants in the sale and purchase agreement may breach Arts 101 and 102 TFEU (particularly Art 101) if trade between Member States is affected. The European Commission’s Notice of March 2005 confirms that, on a transfer of goodwill, a non-compete period of up to two years will be appropriate, whereas a period of three years is justified where the buyer acquires know-how and goodwill.
