# SPA

## Structure of Agreement

Order of the agreement:

- parties and date;
- operative provisions;
- schedules;
- execution by the parties.

Think about if there are any language requirements (e.g., the French insist on French). If there are multiple languages, say which prevails in the event of a conflict.

## Parties

Where there is more than one seller, the details of all the sellers will usually be set out in a schedule to the agreement. Usually, all sellers give warranties. If not, parties described as sellers, warrantors and buyers. There may also be guarantors of the seller's/ buyer's obligations.

### Execution

When the parties execute the agreement, it will be dated, so creating a binding contractual agreement to buy and sell either the shares of the target company or the assets of the business.

Civil law countries do things differently, SPA is usually far shorter. This is because contracts in civil code jurisdictions rely on the underlying code and interpreting the provisions according to good faith.

## Operative Provisions

The operative provisions set out the basis on which the buyer agrees to purchase the shares or assets of the business, and on which the seller agrees to sell. Precise details often in a schedule.

## Definitions and Interpretation

Start with these clauses. Makes the document cleaner.

The buyer will usually want it to be provided expressly that references to statutory provisions are to be interpreted as including subsequent amendments to those provisions. This is dangerous for the seller, particularly in relation to its potential liability under the warranties. Means the seller risks these liabilities increasing.

## Conditions Precedent

Completion of acquisition usually simultaneous with exchange of contracts. But sometimes there are CPs.

If the agreement is conditional, it is usual to include an obligation on the parties to seek fulfilment of the condition, a longstop date by which the condition must be fulfilled or waived, and a time frame within which the acquisition must complete once the condition has been fulfilled.

## Agreement to Purchase

The agreement will also provide that the parties agree to sell/ purchase the specified shares/ assets. Usually provides that buyer is not obliged to buy any shares/ assets until it can purchase simultaneously.

## Consideration

The sale and purchase agreement will stipulate the agreed price, the form that it will take, and the timing of payment. For multiple sellers, price payable to each set out in a schedule.

On an asset sale, the amount of the consideration which is attributable to each separate asset will be specified in the agreement (the agreed apportionment is usually set out in a schedule).

### Completion Accounts

#### Reasons and Form

Parties may have based their valuation of the target on dated information. Buyer may want confirmation that the figures have not altered significantly since the original accounts.

Parties may agree to adjust the purchase price to reflect the actual net assets or earnings of the target on the completion date, as determined by a set of agreed accounts drawn up after completion.

Such completion accounts may consist of:

- Full P&L
- Balance sheet
- Statement of net assets.

#### Control

The seller’s accountant, who is likely to be the target company’s auditor up until completion, is often nominated to prepare the first draft of the completion accounts since it will already be familiar with the business.

But the buyer may prefer to do this itself (to gain familiarity with the business).

#### Typical Provisions

- Maximum amount of the purchase price, with a further adjustment payment/ repayment to be made once the completion accounts have been prepared.
- Adjustment usually made in cash. Actual adjustment depends on what the parties agree.
- Might be one-sided or two-sided, might apply a multiplier to any shortfall in earnings.
- It is also important that the sale and purchase agreement contains clear provisions guarding against possible double recovery that could occur where, for example, a reduction in net assets at completion also constitutes evidence of breach of warranty. The buyer should not be able to recover under an action for breach of warranty, whilst also benefitting from paying a smaller purchase price as a result of the completion accounts.
- Agreed mechanism for completing accounts, usually in a schedule.

```ad-example
title: Typical provisions
1. Completion accounts drawn up within 30 business days. Accountant preparing accounts instructed to do so on a basis consistent with the latest set of audited accounts. 
2. Buyer and accountant have the right to review completion accounts. 
3. In the absence of agreement as to the accounts, a limited period during which the parties will attempt to resolve any disputes;
4. in the case of continued dispute, the matter to be referred to an independent firm of accountants acting as experts. 

```

### Specific Accounting Policies

Clearly set them out. Could be GAAP, UK GAAP or IFRS. Also set out specifics to avoid any grey areas, e.g.,

- In relation to bad debts.
- Valuation of fixed assets
- Applicable depreciation policy.

Consider imposing restrictive covenants to avoid a party trying to improve the results of accounts by making unnecessary changes within their business.

The seller, for example, should be bound in the pre-completion period preventing it from, say, overstocking the business.

### Fixed Price

There is a recent trend towards fixed price, or so-called ‘locked box’, transactions where the parties agree a price for the target company (it is most commonly used in share acquisitions) which is fixed before the sale and purchase agreement is signed.

Risky for the buyer, whose only opportunity for a price adjustment after completion is by bringing a valid warranty claim.

```ad-defn
In a locked box transaction, the economic interest in the target passes to the buyer at a pre-signing date (the ‘locked box date’), and the buyer therefore has the benefit of the cash profits generated by the business from that date. The seller, however, does not receive the sale proceeds until completion, and to compensate the seller for this, the buyer will typically pay interest on the purchase price for the period between the locked box date and closing.
```

The buyer is wise to include provisions in the sale and purchase agreement to protect against ‘leakage’ – that is, the seller extracting value from the target between the date of the agreed accounts and the completion date. Could include payment of a dividend, unsanctioned transfer of assets to target shareholders, or inappropriate payment of expenses by the target.

Specify any permitted leakage in the SPA and details of whether this will result in a reduction of price.

Considerations:

- Certainty of price at an early stage
- Simplicity of process means lower costs
- Seller has increased control over setting the price. Useful especially in an auction process to compare bids.
- Seller must have a suitable balance sheet available
- Seller must ensure interest charged between locked box date and closing is not too low.
- Buyer must negotiate price adjustments earlier in the process with less knowledge of the target.
- Buyer must ensure the SPA clearly defines who is seller/ regulated person for the purposes of identifying leakage.

### Earn Outs

```ad-defn
An arrangement whereby at least part of the consideration is determined by reference to the future profitability of the target for a specified period after completion (eg for the three accounting periods following completion).
```

This avoids a buyer paying too much if the target fails to perform, but motivates sellers/ managers who are staying on post-acquisition.

Provisions usually provide for accounts to be prepared for relevant periods by the buyer's accountant, with an adjustment to the purchase price dependent on a certain level of profitability. Will be based on a multiple of the profits achieved.

Parties will agree a timetable for review of accounts, agreement of earn-out profit and payment, and how any dispute will be resolved.

Civil law: take care to draft such provisions carefully. French law requires the price to be defined, else it is void. Clauses where a party's rights are disproportionate to its obligations can also be held void under French law.

```ad-note
Seller and buyer may be pulling in different directions post-acquisition (maximising short term profit vs long-term gain). Parties may limit the tension by defining the objectives of the company post-completion. 
```

### Payment Terms

Often a fixed amount is paid in cash on the completion date, but parties free to agree other terms (e.g., deferred payment, payment through issuing of shares).

### Deferred Consideration

Seller will usually demand interest on the outstanding amount and will insist on security for payment. Purchase price often subject to an adjustment dependent on completion accounts. Buyer may insist on a retention of part of the purchase price as security in case a warranty claim arises in relation to the target. Usually only appropriate where there is an identified but unquantified liability.

#### Tax Treatment

```ad-guid
title: General rule
Seller will be charged to tax as at the date of sale on the total amount of the consideration, regardless of whether that consideration has actually been received. If the consideration is certain, the fact that some of it is deferred will not affect the seller’s tax position. 
```

Where the consideration cannot be ascertained at completion because it is dependent on future events, such as the profitability of the target after the sale (as with an earn-out arrangement), the rule set out in [[Marren (Inspector of Taxes) v Ingles [1980] 3 All ER 95]] applies and tax is charged on the disposal of two separate capital assets.

- First disposal is of the shares of the target company/ assets of the target business.
	- Seller treated as having received as consideration both the consideration actually received at completion + a "chose in action" (right to receive further payment if future profits attained).
	- Chose in action given a value by HMRC.
- Where the earn-out is received, treated as a second disposal by the seller.
	- If the payment exceeds original valuation by HMRC, seller treated as having made a capital gain, and charged to CGT/ corporation tax.
	- Loss is an allowable loss for seller's capital gains purposes.

```ad-warning
The principle applies only where the parties do not, as at Completion, have the information required to determine the deferred consideration. If consideration is deferred pending agreement of Completion Accounts, the parties do have the information required to determine the the target's financial condition as at Completion but have not yet processed the information.
```

Buyer's tax position for stamp duty purposes also dependent on whether deferred consideration is ascertainable at completion.

1. Where the consideration is certain but deferred, stamp duty is payable within 30 days of the completion date – no allowance for the deferral is made.
2. Where the amount of the deferred consideration has not yet been determined but is ascertainable at completion, for example because it is dependent on the preparation of completion accounts, the Stamp Office applies the ‘wait and see’ principle (stamp duty will be charged once the consideration has been finally determined).

```ad-action
The buyer should nonetheless submit the stock transfer forms for stamping within 30 days of completion, and make a payment on account of stamp duty, to avoid penalties and reduce interest charges (which run from 30 days after the completion date even if the consideration has yet to be ascertained).
```

1. Where the deferred consideration is unascertainable at completion, as with an earn-out arrangement, no stamp duty is payable on it unless the ‘contingency’ principle applies. Under the contingency principle, if the consideration is stated to be subject to a minimum or a maximum amount, or is to be calculated by reference to a basic or ‘benchmark’ figure, then stamp duty is chargeable on that minimum, maximum or benchmark sum. Where both a minimum and a maximum are specified, stamp duty is charged on the maximum amount.

### Security

Where part of the purchase price does remain outstanding on completion, the seller may seek security for the outstanding sums:

1. by taking a **charge** over some or all of the assets transferred to the buyer;
2. by requiring a **guarantee** of the buyer’s obligation to pay the balance of the price (e.g., from parent company/ directors);
3. by providing in the agreement that **title** to specified assets is to remain with the seller until the purchase price is paid in full;
4. by obliging the buyer to place a specified sum in a **joint deposit account** (or escrow account) on completion and defining the circumstances in which this (and accrued interest) can be released to the parties.

### Form

The buyer will usually be borrowing. Where the buyer is a company, all or part of the consideration may be satisfied by the company issuing equity securities (shares) or debt securities (loan notes) to the seller. Avoids the need to increase borrowing/ make disposals of assets to fund the acquisition.

Tax: seller on a share sale may be able to roll over any capital gain made on the disposal of shares in the target, deferring the capital tax which it would otherwise pay until disposal of the securities in the acquiring company received in exchange.

#### Shares

The seller will accept consideration in the form of shares only if the shares are readily marketable, i.e., they can in the future be realised for cash. Where shares are issued as consideration, the agreement should specify how they rank with the other shares of the acquiring company and what rights the seller will have to any dividend declared in relation to a period in which completion falls.

The buyer may insist on a clause restricting the seller from disposing of more than a specified percentage of shares within a specified period (to avoid depressing the price by selling lots of shares at once).

Where the acquiring company wishes to issue shares as consideration, but the seller only wants cash, it can be achieved through “vendor placing”. This is an arrangement whereby the acquiring company issues shares to the seller, but arranges (through its financial advisers) for the shares to be sold on immediately to institutional investors. The acquiring company undertakes in the sale and purchase agreement that the sale of the consideration shares will yield a specified sum.

#### Debt Securities

The acquiring company may issue debt securities like loan notes to the seller for the purchase price/ part of it. Usually, the seller is entitled to demand repayment of all/ part at 6 monthly intervals.

It may suit the seller to receive staggered payments in this way with interest on the balance outstanding, particularly as roll-over relief from capital tax is available in the UK on the same basis as for shares under a securities exchange.

The form of the loan note will usually be agreed between the parties and set out in a schedule to the sale and purchase agreement. ). A loan note may or may not be secured, and will usually be an acceptable form of payment for the seller only if the creditworthiness of the buyer can be assured.

## Contractual Provisions

The remaining section of the operative provisions in the sale and purchase agreement will set out the basis on which the seller will provide any contractual reassurances, or warranties, about the target business or company. The actual warranty usually appears in a schedule, but the operative provisions set out the basis on which warranties are given.

```ad-example
Typically, restrictive covenants limiting the Seller's business activities post Completion are included to protect the goodwill of the target company.
```

The agreement may also provide for specific indemnities in relation to identified problems. On a share purchase, this includes tax indemnities, where the seller agrees to indemnify the buyer in respect of any tax liability arising in the target.

Tax indemnities/ covenants may be drafted as a separate document, but more usual to incorporate them into the main body of the agreement.

## Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

Specify any ADR methods to be used and/ or provisions for litigation, including a forum selection provision and governing law provisions. Provides certainty and prevents future litigation of such issues.

Usual to also contain a notice clause specifying a mechanism for the service of notices from one party to the other as a way of exercising contractual rights/ demanding compliance with certain obligations. Pay attention to time ones, business days and national holidays.

## Schedules

The bulk of the SPA is usually attributable to schedules. Issues covered will be determined by the terms of the transaction and whether it is an asset or share acquisition. Include:

- Details of assets/ shareholdings to be transferred and prices
- Details of price adjustment mechanism
- Warranty statements about conditions of target
- Limitations on liability in relation to warranty claims
- Specific indemnities agreed between parties in relation to identified risks
- Agreed forms of documentation governing associated transactions
- Agreed restrictions on running the target business pending completion, if the agreement is exchanged conditionally (meaning a gap between exchange and completion).
- Details of the completion procedure.

## Execution

The sale and purchase agreement is purely a contract setting out the terms on which the acquisition will be undertaken, so it can simply be signed by the parties. However, to avoid any question about whether appropriate consideration has been given in relation to specific indemnities and restrictive covenants included in the agreement, the buyer may prefer the agreement to be executed as a deed.

Prior to exchange and completion, the legal advisers will confirm the parties’ capability to enter into the agreement
