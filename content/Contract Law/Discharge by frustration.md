# Discharge by frustration

## Definition

Modern definition of frustration provided by Lord Radcliffe in [[Davis Contractors v Fareham Urban District Council [1956] AC 696]]:

> “Frustration occurs whenever the law recognises that, without default of either party, a contractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. …It was not this that I promised to do.”

A frustrating event is a supervening event that is the fault of neither party, and renders the contract impossible, illegal, or radically different. From the date of the frustrating event, all future obligations re discharged by operation of law. The more foreseeable the event, the less likely it is to frustrate.

Lord Simon in [[National Carriers Limited v Panalpina (Northern) Limited [1981] AC 651]] described frustration in the following terms:

> The effect of frustration is broadly to relieve a party from further obligations under the contract, so they do not have to meet these radically different obligations. If a contract is frustrated, it is brought to an end automatically: the parties have no choice in the matter. Frustration may be raised as a defence to an action for breach of contract.

Performance might be radially different because:

- Performance is impossible
- Performance is illegal
- Common purpose is frustrated

A frustrating event is not:

- Merely an increase in expense/ onerousness
- Caused by the default of a party
- Something which the parties could reasonably have contemplated
- Something provided for in the contract

## Radically Different Performance

### Impossibility

The doctrine of frustration may be invoked in circumstances where the contract becomes impossible to perform due to the total or partial destruction of some object necessary to the performance of the contract.

- [[Taylor v Caldwell (1863) 3 B & S 826]]
- [[Appleby v Myers (1867) LR 2 CP 651]]

Impossibility might extend to situations of death or illness of one of the parties in a personal contract, especially where a specified individual is engaged to render a particular service ([[Condor v The Barron Knights Ltd [1966] 1 WLR 87]]).

### Unavailability

The concept of unavailability is common in shipping contracts. Even temporary unavailability may discharge a contract if the interruption is such as to make performance substantially different from what was originally undertaken. Thus, where a ship was requisitioned for a period of five months out of a year's charterparty, the contract was frustrated ([[Bank Line v Arthur Capel & Co [1919] AC 435]]).

Difficulty in deciding whether frustration has occurred: [[Tamplin SS Co Ltd v Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Co [1916] 2 AC 397]].

The amount of time left to run in the contract is the starting point only in establishing frustration ([[Edwinton Commercial Corporation v Tsavliris Russ (Worldwide Salvage & Towage) Ltd, The Sea Angel [2007] EWCA Civ 547]]). A multifactorial approach should be adopted when assessing whether unavailability was sufficient to amount to frustration. The factors to be considered included:

> “the terms of the contract itself, its matrix or context, the parties' knowledge, expectations, assumptions and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of contract, at any rate so far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, and then the nature of the supervening event, and the parties' reasonable and objectively ascertainable calculations as to the possibilities of future performance in the new circumstances.”

### Illegal Performance

If a change of law or state intervention renders performance illegal, this will frustrate a contract. A classic example is when war breaks out, and continuing performance would mean trading with the enemy ([[Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd [1943] AC 32]]).

### Common Purpose Frustrated

Where the common purpose for which the contract was entered into can no longer be carried out because of some supervening event, the contract may be frustrated despite the fact that it is still physically possible to carry out the contract. This must be the joint purpose of the parties ([[Krell v Henry [1903] 2 KB 740]]).

See also:

- [[Herne Bay Steamboat Co Ltd v Hutton [1903] 2 KB 683]]
- [[Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd v European Medicines Agency [2019] EWHC 335 (Ch)]]

These cases show that [[Krell v Henry [1903] 2 KB 740]] was a very narrow decision which has been distinguished, not followed.

## Limitations of Doctrine of Frustration

Viscount Simonds in [[Tsakiroglou Co Ltd v Noblee Thorl GmbH [1962] AC 93]]: the doctrine of frustration

> 'must be applied within very narrow limits'

So the law has developed a number of limitations on the doctrine:

### Increase in expense/ Onerousness

It is very rare for a contract to be held to have been frustrated by an event which leaves it possible to perform but which simply makes it much more onerous to one party. It is unlikely that a contract will be frustrated merely because of an event making the contract less valuable to one party, or more expensive to perform ([[Davis Contractors v Fareham Urban District Council [1956] AC 696]]).

### Caused by the Default of a Party

Frustration will not apply where the event was induced by one of the parties, i.e., because the event was their fault or choice. It is for the party alleging self-induced frustration to prove that it is. If they succeed in showing the frustrating event is self-induced, then the defence of frustration fails, and the defendant will be in breach of contract. This is often applied rather harshly ([[J Lauritzen AS v Wijsmuller BV (‘Super Servant Two’) [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1]]).

### Foreseeability

The doctrine of frustration is a means of allocating unforeseen risks.

In [[Edwinton Commercial Corporation v Tsavliris Russ (Worldwide Salvage & Towage) Ltd, The Sea Angel [2007] EWCA Civ 547]], Rix LJ summarised the relationship of foreseeability to the doctrine of frustration:

> “In a sense, most events are to a greater or lesser degree foreseeable. That does not mean that they cannot lead to frustration. Even events which are not merely foreseen but made the subject of express contractual provision may lead to frustration: as occurs when an event such as a strike, or a restraint of princes, lasts for so long as to go beyond the risk assumed under the contract and to render performance radically different from that contracted for. However, … the less that an event, in its type and its impact, is foreseeable, the more likely it is to be a factor which, depending on other factors in the case, may lead on to frustration.”

So if an event could have been foreseen, but provision was not made for this in the contract, the doctrine of frustration will be less likely to apply ([[Flying Music Company Limited v Theater Entertainment SA [2017] EWHC 3192 (QB)]]).

The key test is now whether the event would have informed the manner in which the parties assessed the risk of entering into the contract. Highly theoretical risks which the parties would not have taken into account would not be relevant ([[Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd v European Medicines Agency [2019] EWHC 335 (Ch)]]).

### Express Contractual Provision

The doctrine of frustration cannot override express and unambiguous contractual provision for the frustrating event. Commercial contracts usually contain a *force majeure* clause, stating what will happen to the contractual relationship should a particular set of circumstances materialise. These include, terrorism, war, or 'Acts of God'.

This allows for the continuance of the contractual relationship, in circumstances that would otherwise amount to frustration of the contract.

## Consequences of Frustration

If a frustrating event occurs, all future obligations are automatically discharged by the common law. The [Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/6-7/40/contents) deals with obligations arising prior to the frustrating event.

## S 1(2)

Section 1(2) of the Act makes the following provision

- Money paid before the frustrating event can be recovered
- Money that should have been paid before the frustrating event no longer needs to be paid.
- Expenses incurred by the payee (usually the supplier) can be recovered out of the total sum paid/payable before the event. The recovery of expenses is at the discretion of the court.

This gives the court a discretionary power to order such retention or recovery of money as it thinks just in all circumstances, to account for expenses incurred by the payee. The expenses incurred by the payee must be directly related to an attempt to perform the contract.

The amount retained or recovered is capped and cannot exceed

1. The actual expenses incurred, and
2. The amount paid or payable prior to the frustrating event.

It is for the payee to establish that the expenses were incurred, and that it is just for the court to deduct them from the sums paid or payable to him before the frustrating event.

If the supplier has expenses exceeding the amount of advanced payments actually paid or invoiced, then it cannot claim them back. If nothing was paid or payable before the frustrating event, the party will not be able to get any expenses at all.

It is also important to note the requirement that it be just for the supplier to retain the expenses. The sum retained or recovered to account for the expenses may not be the actual expenses incurred, but only what the court considers to be a just sum, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

The court has a very broad discretion as to what is a just sum ([[Gamerco SA v ICM Fair Warning (Agency) Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 1226]]).

## S 1(3)

Where the benefit conferred before the frustrating event occurs is a non-monetary benefit, s 1(3) can help. It provides that **a party who has gained a valuable benefit under the contract before the frustrating event may be required to pay a just sum for it**. So the court must

1. identify and value the benefit conferred
2. make an assessment of the just sum that should be awarded.

Leading case on interpretation of s 1(3): [[BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No.2) [1982] 1 All ER 925]]. Ratio: where the value of the benefit has been reduced to nil by the frustrating event, the provider of the 'benefit' has no claim. The defendant's benefit under s 1(3) is not necessarily the value of the claimant's performance.
