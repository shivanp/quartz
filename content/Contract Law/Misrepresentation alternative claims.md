# Misrepresentation alternative claims

## Terms of Contract

A representation may become a term of the contract if the court decides it is incorporated into the contract. If the court decides that a representation is a term, and it is false, this will give rise to an action for both breach of contract and potentially for misrepresentation.

But if the representation is not incorporated into the contract, it will remain a representation.

## Negligent Misstatement at Common Law

The law of misrepresentation intervenes in relation to false statements which induce the representee to enter into a contract.

The law of negligent misstatement is part of the law of negligence. Where there is a relationship of sufficient proximity between two parties, the court might find that one party owes a duty of care to the other to take reasonable care that statements made are accurate. Duty extends to statements made during contractual negotiations, but not limited to such statements.

Generally, if a claim of misrepresentation is available, party would not need/want to pursue a claim in negligent misstatement.

Might be needed e.g. if poor advice was given by a third party, inducing a party to enter into a contract.
