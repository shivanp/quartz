# Discharge by performance

## Entire Obligations Rule

A contractual obligation is discharged by a complete performance of the obligation. The promisee is entitled to the benefit of complete performance exactly according to the promisor's undertaking. A promisor who only performs part of their obligation is not discharged from that obligation.

Generally this doesn't work by half measures: if B has performed half their obligations for A, they cannot claim for half the payment, even if half the service is of value to the other party.

Key case: [[Cutter v Powell (1796) 6 Term Rep 320]].

## Exceptions to Entire Obligations

### Acceptance of Partial Performance

The innocent party can choose to accept part of the performance at their discretion. If the innocent party voluntarily accepts partial performance, then the party in default will be entitled to payment on a [[quantum meruit]] basis.

See [[Sumpter v Hedges (1898) 1 QB 673]].

### Substantial Performance

Where a contract has been substantially performed, it may be possible for the party who rendered such substantial performance to obtain the contract price subject to a deduction to reflect the cost of remedying the 'defect'.

If the defect is too serious, the party who rendered the defective performance will not be entitled to recover any money.

The test for defining what is 'substantial performance' is similar to the test for deciding if there has been a repudiatory breach of contract. The court asks if the defect goes 'to the root of the contract'. The purpose of the contract has to be considered; contrast:

- [[Hoenig v Isaacs [1952] 2 ALL ER 176]] (substantial performance of flat redecoration)
- [[Bolton v Mahadeva [1972] 1 WLR 1009]] (central heating installation did not work so no substantial performance).

### Divisible Obligations

Some contracts are clearly intended to be divided into parts (e.g., payment of a salary). In these cases, the performing party is entitled to payment for each part which is performed. The question of whether a contract is divisible or entire depends on the intention of parties.

### Wrongful Prevention of Performance

Where one party performs part of the agreed obligation, and is then prevented from completing the rest by some fault of the other party, they will be entitled to payment despite not having completed the rest of the obligation ([[Planche v Colborn 131 ER 305]]).

The innocent party can then either:

- Sue for damages for breach of contract, or
- Claim a *quantum merit*

## Defences to Allegations of Failure to Perform

A party being accused of failing to perform their obligations can potentially draw a defence:

### Tender of Performance

In an action for breach of contract for failing to perform an obligation, it is a valid defence for the defendant to show that they 'tendered performance'.

For a plea of tender to be successful, the promisor must show that they unconditionally offered to perform their obligations in accordance with the terms of the contract, but that the promisee refused to accept such performance.

e.g., if the seller delivered goods, but the purchaser refused to accept delivery, the seller would be relieved of liability for failing to deliver.

#### Exception

In relation to payment of a debt, a plea of tender does not discharge the debt. But it does prevent the creditor from claiming interest or damages on that debt subsequent to the tender of performance.
