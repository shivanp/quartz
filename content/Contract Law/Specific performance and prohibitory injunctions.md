# Specific performance and prohibitory injunctions

Another remedy potentially available in the case of breach of contract.

Classifying terms of a contract:

Type of term | Description
---|---
Positive term/ stipulation | Term requiring a party to do something
Negative term/ stipulation | Term requiring a party not to do something.

## Specific Performance

> An order of specific performance is issued by the court to the defendant, requiring it to carry out its obligations under a positive term of the contract.

Breaching a court order for specific performance has more severe consequences than breaching a contract. It is treated as contempt of court and can lead to imprisonment.

## Prohibitory Injunction

> A prohibitory injunction is a court order restraining a party from breaching a negative term.

Breach of a prohibitory injunction can be punished as contempt of court.

## Availability

An order for specific performance or a prohibitory injunction will not be granted if damages are an appropriate and adequate remedy ([[Adderley v Dixon (1824) 3 S & S 607]]).

To show damages are inadequate in the specific performance context, it will need to be proved that the subject matter of the contract is unique/ irreplaceable, or that an award of damages would be ineffective to provide adequate compensation.

Damages are the default, specific performance and prohibitory injunctions are discretionary and equitable remedies.

Discretionary: the court considers all relevant circumstances, and there are no clear criteria which, if satisfied, entitle a party to an injunction.

Equitable: the remedies originate from the courts of equity. Equitable principles which apply include:

1. The court will take into account the conduct of the claimant: 'he who comes to equity must come with clean hands' ([[Coatsworth v Johnson (1886) 55 LJQB 220]]).
2. The action must be brought with reasonable promptness: 'delay defeats equity' ([[Eads v Williams (1854) 4 De G Mac & g 674]]).

### Specific Performance Principles

Following principles apply to the grant of an order for specific performance:

1. Specific performance will not be awarded where it would cause undue hardship on the defendant ([[Patel v Ali [1984] 1 All ER 978]])
2. A promise given for no consideration is not specifically enforceable, even if it is made a deed
3. Specific performance will not be awarded for breach of employment contracts ([s236 Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/236)). For other contracts involving services, specific performance will not be awarded if there has been a breakdown of trust and confidence between the parties, or if the court would need to consider subjective opinions regarding performance ([[CH Giles & Co Ltd v Morris [1972] 1 WLR 307]])
4. Specific performance will not be awarded for breach of an obligation to perform a series of acts which would need the constant supervision of the court ([[Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd [1998] AC 1]])
5. Specific performance will not be awarded for breach of a contract which is not binding on both parties. So where a contract is voidable at the option of party A, party B will not get specific performance against party A.

### Prohibitory Injunction Principles

The court may decide to limit an injunction to what it considers reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.

Prohibitory injunctions are only granted where “just and convenient” ([s 37 Senior Courts Act 1981](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/37)), e.g., see [[William Robinson & Co Ltd v Heuer (1898) 2 Ch 451]].

## Substance Not Form

The court will look at the substance of the proposed remedy, rather than the superficial wording of the injunction (e.g., [[Sky Petroleum Ltd v VIP Petroleum Ltd [1974] 1 All ER 954]])
