# Guarantees and indemnities

It is possible for both a guarantee and an indemnity to be given at the same time.

Assume that A has borrowed money from B, and so A owes a contractual obligation to repay that money to B.

> A guarantee is a promise by a party to ensure that another party carries out its obligations, or a promise to fulfil those obligations itself if the other party does not do so.

> An indemnity is a promise to reimburse someone in the event that they suffer a stated loss.

Suppose C indemnifies B against non-repayment of the loan to A. Then C's obligation is a primary obligation, so C's liability might ultimately be even more than A's was. Provides greater protection for B: it can look to either A or C for payment.

## Practical Implications

- Substance not form is important
- If A's obligations cease, then if C has provided a guarantee, C's obligation under the guarantee will also cease, because it is dependent on A's obligation
- If C provides an indemnity, this would remain in place.
- If there is a change to the contract between A and B after the guarantee/ indemnity is given, then a guarantee would almost always be discharged, but an indemnity would remain in force.
- To execute a guarantee, it must be in writing and signed by the guarantor. Not necessary for an indemnity.

## Indemnities in Other Contexts

Indemnities can also exist in a two-party scenario.

Say A agrees to deliver goods to B. A can also indemnify B in relation to any loss suffered by B as a result of late delivery.

This is still a promise to reimburse someone for loss, but the obligation to delivery and indemnify are coming from the same party. An indemnity can be drafted in a way that avoids some rules of causation, mitigation, remoteness, and proof which might limit a claim for damages.
