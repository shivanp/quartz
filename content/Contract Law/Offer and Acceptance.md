# Offer and Acceptance

## Introduction

For a contract, require [[Offeror]] to make clear and certain offer, displaying intention to be bound and [[Offeree]] needs to make unequivocal acceptance.

When determining what constitutes agreement, an objective approach is used, considering what the reasonable man would say was the intention of the parties, see [[Storer v Manchester City Council [1974] 1 WLR 1403]].

## Offer

The offer must be *clear and certain, displaying an intention to be bound*.

- In [[Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] 1 WLR 294]] offer was not clear and certain
- But in [[Storer v Manchester City Council [1974] 1 WLR 1403]] was an intention to be bound.

An offer can't be accepted in ignorance of the offer ([[R v Clarke [1972] 1 All ER 219]]).

## Acceptance

In a [[Unilateral contract]], the offer is accepted by performance of the required act, whereas in a [[Bilateral contract]] the offer is accepted by unequivocal communication of acceptance, at which point each party is bound.

Acceptances must be distinguished from requests for further information ([[Stevenson Jaques & Co. v McLean (1880) 5 QBD 346]]).

There are four aspects to determining whether there has been the communication of a unequivocal acceptance needed to form a contract:

1. Acceptance must be in response to the offer.
2. Acceptance must be unqualified
	1. Must correspond exactly with the terms of the offer – mirror image rule ([[Hyde v Wrench (1840) 49 ER 132]]).
3. It may be necessary to follow a prescribed mode of acceptance.
	1. If offeror has specified a mode of acceptance using mandatory words and has explicitly excluded all other modes, then only an acceptance in the prescribed mode will bind the offeror ([[Manchester Diocesan Council of Education v Commercial and General Investments Ltd [1969] 3 All ER 1593]].
	2. Otherwise, an acceptance that is 'no less advantageous' will bind offeror ([[Tinn v Hoffman (1873) 29 LT 271]])
4. Acceptance must be communicated.
	1. The offeror cannot stipulate that they will take silence to be acceptance and thus bind the offeree.
	2. A third party can communicate acceptance on behalf of the offeree, but this must be done with the authority of the offeree.
	3. The communication of acceptance is waived in a unilateral contract ([[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1893) 1 QB 256]]).

## Invitations to Treat

**Different from an offer**. Invitation to treat is the first step in negotiations, usually an invitation for offers to be made. Cannot be treated as a binding contract.

### Advertisements

Regarded as statements inviting further negotiation or as invitations to treat, see [[Partridge v Crittenden [1968] 1 WLR 1204]]. Does make sense (vendor may have limited stock, can't be seen as a contract).

#### Exception: Unilateral Offer

When the advertisement amounts to a unilateral offer, it is seen as a binding contract: [[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1893) 1 QB 256]] (includes prescribed act and clear intention to be bound).

### Display of Goods for Sale

Generally an invitation to treat, not an offer for sale; [[Fisher v Bell [1961] 1 QB 394]]. So a shop special offer is not actually an offer. Makes sense: a shop shouldn't be obliged to sell any products, e.g., if they are age-restricted. The same goes for goods on shelves of self-service store: [[Pharmaceutical Society of GB v Boots Cash Chemists [1953] 1 QB 401]].

## Invitations to Tender

Generally regarded as an invitation to treat ([[Spencer v Harding (1870) LR 5 CP 561]]), so requestor can accept or reject any offer, even the most competitive.

### Exception: Explicit Undertaking to Accept Highest or Lowest Bid

This then forms a [[Unilateral contract]], where the required act is making the highest/ lowest bid. See [[Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust Co. of Canada (CI) Ltd [1985] Ch 103]].

An invitation to tender can also give rise to a binding contractual obligation to consider tenders where:

1. tenders solicited from specific parties known to the requesting party
2. absolute deadline for submission
3. party requesting tenders had laid down absolute and non-negotiable conditions for submission  
See [[Blackpool & Fylde Aero Club Ltd v Blackpool Borough Council [1990] 1 WLR 1195]] for details.

## Auction Sales

Auctioneer's request for bids generally seen as an invitation to treat: [[Payne v Cave (1789) 3 Durn & E 148]]. Bidders then make offers which the auctioneer can accept or reject at their discretion. Acceptance indicated by fall of hammer.

Means that offeror can revoke offer at any time before the hammer falls. s 57 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 states:

> "a sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer, or in other customary manner; and until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid"

### Auctions without Reserve

No 'reserve price' - floor price below which seller can choose not to sell. So must sell to the highest bidder, no matter what that bid turns out to be: [[Warlow v Harrison (1859) 1 E & E 309]].

For sales without reserve, two contracts:

- [[Bilateral contract]] (bidder making offer which auctioneer can accept or reject)
- [[Unilateral contract]] based on promise that auction will be without reserve.  
So if sale items withdrawn from sale, this breaches the unilateral contract and bidder can be compensated by damages. But highest bidder not entitled to the goods themselves — see [[Warlow v Harrisson [1859] EngR 1046]], confirmed in [[Barry v Davies [2000] 1 WLR 1962]]

## Postal Rule

A posted acceptance is effective upon proper posting ([[Adams v Lindsell (1818) 1 B & Ald 681]]). A letter is properly posted when it is put into an official letter box or into the hands of an employee of the Post Office who is authorised to receive letters. Note that a letter is not properly posted by putting it into the hands of a postman who is only authorised to deliver letters.

The postal rule applies even if the letter is delayed/ lost in the post ([[Household Fire Insurance v Grant [1879] 4 Ex D 216]]).

But this rule does not apply if:

- It was not contemplated that post would be used ([[Henthorn v Fraser [1892] 2 Ch 27]]).
	- It is unreasonable to use the post where there is an implied condition that prompt acceptance is required.
- If manifestly inconvenient/ absurd
- To letters revoking offers ([[Bryne v Van Tienhoven (1880) 5 CPD 344]])
- If incorrectly addressed
- If disapplied by offeror ([[Holwell Securities v Hughes [1974] 1 WLR 155]] offeror specified that notice was required)

### Instantaneous Communication

On the contrary, when acceptance is sent by instantaneous means, a contract is created when notice of acceptance is received ([[Entores v Miles Far East Corp [1955] 2 QB 327]]). Denning: with instantaneous communication, the person sending the message of acceptance knows or ought to know whether their message has been received.

If acceptance is not received due to the fault of the offeror, then there is a contract. But if not received due to a fault of the offeree, or through the fault of no party, then there is no contract.

The postal rule is inapplicable to email communications ([[Thomas v BPE Solicitors [2010] EWHC 306 (CH)]]).

If instantaneous communication is sent during ordinary office hours, but not seen until later, communication is effective when received (*The Brimnes [1975] QB 929*).

If acceptance is sent outside office hours, deemed to be received first thing the next working day ([[Mondial Shipping & Chartering BV v Astarte Shipping BV]]). But meaning of office hours depends on context ([[Thomas v BPE Solicitors [2010] EWHC 306 (CH)]]).

## Offer Closing

- Rejection or counter-offer (which counts as rejection: [[Hyde v Wrench (1840) 49 ER 132]])
- Lapse
	- This includes lapse of time specified in the offer
	- Or, if no time specified, lapse of a reasonable time (depending on the circumstances)
- Revocation
	- The offeror can revoke their offer at any time before acceptance ([[Payne v Cave (1789) 3 Durn & E 148]])
	- Revocation of an offer is effective only upon actual notice of it reaching the offeree. Postal rule does not apply: [[Byrne & Co v Leon Van Tien Hoven & Co [1880] 5 CPD 344]])
	- Provided that the offeror has shown, by words or conduct, a clear intention to revoke their offer and notice has reached the offeree, the revocation is effective. The means of communication does not matter, so the revocation will be effective even if communicated by a third party ([[Dickinson v Dodds (1876) 2 Ch D 463]])
	- In relation to unilateral contracts, acceptance is perceived as the complete performance of the act(s) required by the terms of the unilateral offer
		- Exception: where the offeree has partly performed the obligation and is willing and able to complete. Here, the offeror may be under an implied obligation not to revoke the offer once performance has commenced ([[Errington v Errington & Wood [1952] 1 KB 290]]).
		- In circumstances where a unilateral offer has been made to the whole world, communication of revocation is almost impossible, so revocation will be effective if the offeror takes reasonable steps to bring the revocation to the attention of all those who may have read the offer.
