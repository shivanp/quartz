# Discharge by breach

## Repudiatory Breach of Contract at Common Law

The usual remedy for breach of contract is compensatory damages. This is in principle available for any breach of contract, but a party does not always acquire a right to terminate the contract as a result of the breach.

In certain circumstances, the innocent party may treat the contract as having been terminated by the repudiatory breach. This is when either a condition has been breached, or an innominate term has been breached which can be treated as a condition.

Breach | Remedy
---|---
Breach of warranty (or innominate term treated as such) | Damages only
Breach of condition (or innominate term treated as such) | Damages plus right of election.

So a contract can come to an end through termination for a [[repudiatory breach]]. The innocent party generally has a choice as to termination or affirmation, though this is not entirely unrestricted.

### Anticipatory Breach

This is where a party indicates they will not perform their contractual obligations in advance of the date for performance. A party who, by words or conduct, leads a reasonable person to conclude that they do not intend to perform their part of the contract, is said to have 'renounced' the contract.

The innocent party has an immediate right to 'accept' the renunciation and to treat the contract as terminated ([[Hochster v De la Tour (1853) 2 E&B 678]]).

An indication by a party that they will not perform their contractual obligations in only a minor regard will not give rise to the right to terminate. If a party wants to rely on an anticipatory repudiatory breach to terminate the contract then it will need to demonstrate that if the breach occurred at the time performance was due it would have been repudiatory.

### The Effect of Terminating a Contract for Repudiatory Breach

Where the contract is terminated following a repudiatory breach, this puts an end to all primary obligations of both parties remaining unperformed. Furthermore, the innocent party can claim damages not only arising from the specific breach, but also the loss of the contract caused by the termination of the contract as a whole.

The discharge from remaining rights and obligations is 'prospective' only: any rights and obligations which have accrued before termination remain enforceable. If a customer owes fees for services provided prior to termination, then it would still be obliged to pay them.

### Risks of Wrongful Termination

Suppose A gives notice to terminate its contract with B on the grounds of a breach by B, which it believes to be a breach of condition and therefore repudiatory. If the court later finds that the breach was of a warranty, then A had no right to terminate the contract. Then A's wrongful notice of termination will be regarded as a 'renunciation' of future performance of the contract, or a serious breach of contract. This can be accepted by B as repudiating the contract.

This could be commercially disastrous. Moreover, unless the term which has been breached has been defined as a condition, then the categorisation of the term will depend on application of the [[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962] 2 QB 26]] test. This is a high bar, and it is generally no excuse for A to plead that they acted in good faith, believing B's breach to justify the remedial action taken.

So commercial parties often instead explicitly agree to a list of breaches which will give rise to a right to terminate.

### Right to Election

Where there has been a repudiatory breach of contract, the contract is terminated only if the aggrieved party makes the election to treat the breach as repudiating the contract. The innocent party must make their decision to terminate the contract known to the party in default ([[Vitol SA v Norelf Ltd, The Santa Clara [1996] 3 All ER 193]]). The innocent party is allowed a period of time in order to decide between the alternatives.

Benefits of affirmation/termination:

- Contract survives and the rights of the innocent party are preserved.
- The contract may relate to a major project, where affirming and continuing, giving the contractor the opportunity to finish, is a better option than abandoning it altogether and having to sue for damages and find another contractor
- Or the innocent party may calculate that if the contract can be performed such that a right to charge the contractual charges as a debt will arise, then it will put itself in a better and more certain financial position than if it terminates the contract and brings a claim for unliquidated damages. The value of a damages claim is uncertain.

Where a party has indicated an intention not to perform its obligations, the innocent party can still affirm the contract, perform its own obligations, and claim the sum due under the contract in a debt action ([[White and Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1962] AC 413]]).

If a party does affirm a contract, the innocent party will retain a claim for damages arising from the breach but cannot terminate as a result of it. So the **damages would not include compensation for loss of performance of the contract as a whole**. The election is between accepting the contract as discharged or continuing. The election is not a waiver of damages from the relevant breach.

To affirm a contract, there must be clear and unequivocal commitment to continuing with the contract.

### Limitations of Affirmation

The courts have identified some situations in which it is not open to the innocent party to affirm.

- The innocent party must not need the cooperation of the contract-breaker in order to perform the contract ([[Hounslow London Borough Council v Twickenham Garden Developments Ltd [1970] 3 WLR 538]])
	- This qualification should be uncontroversial. If the innocent party requires the co-operation of the other contracting party in order to fulfil their obligations under the contract, this will prevent the innocent party claiming the contract price.
- The innocent party must have a “legitimate interest” in affirming the contract (per Lord Reid in [[White and Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1962] AC 413]]). This has not been clearly defined, but there will be no legitimate interest where affirmation is “wholly unreasonable” (*The Alaskan Trader*) or if damages (instead of the contract price) would be an adequate remedy.
	- It is only in extreme cases that the innocent party will not have a legitimate interest in affirmation ([[Ocean Marine Navigation Ltd v Koch Carbon Inc (The Dynamic) [2003] EWHC 1936 (Comm)]]) and will only operate if the defendant can show that
		1. damages would be an adequate remedy for the claimant and
		2. an election to keep the contract alive would be unreasonable.
	- e.g., landlords could have a legitimate interest in affirming because they have negotiated a top rent that might not be available in the current letting market ([[Reichman v Beveridge [2006] EWCA Civ 1659]])
	- The burden of proof is on the breaching party to show that the innocent party does not have a legitimate interest in affirming the contract.

[Good article](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/publications/right-to-affirm-a-contract-after-repudiatory-breach-fettered-by-good-faith) on this, referring to the case [[MSC Mediterranean Shipping COmpany v Cottonex Anstalt [2016] EWCA Civ 789]]]

Elect to affirm | Elect to terminate
---|---
Must be unequivocal commitment to continue | Notification required
Entitled to damages | Entitled to damages
Not required to mitigate loss ([[White and Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1962] AC 413]]) | Must mitigate loss
Contractual obligations remain | Contractual obligations relieved
Need a legitimate interest | No interest needed
Potentially limited if co-operation of breaching party is required for continued performance of the contract | No such limitation

Generally, if terminating a contract, need to take **reasonable steps** to mitigate your loss.

### Dangers of Affirmation

The affirming party may themselves breach the contract (The Simona) or a frustrating event may deny any right to damages ([[Avery v Bowden (1856) 5 E & B 714]]). If they affirm, the innocent party must also carry out their obligations in full to sue for the contract price.
