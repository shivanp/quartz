# Promissory estoppel

## Definition

Equitable exception to the general rule that consideration is required before a party is bound to a contract.

> where, by words or conduct, a person makes an unambiguous representation as to his future conduct, intending the representation to be relied on and to affect the legal relations between the parties, and the representee alters his position in reliance on it, the representor will be unable to act inconsistently with the representation if by so doing the representee would be prejudiced.

## Features

Protects party's reliance on a non-bargain promise. Most commonly relied on to create an **exception to the rule that part payment of a debt without fresh consideration does not discharge the debt obligation.**

The modern doctrine derives from [[Hughes v Metropolitan Railway (1877) LR 2 App Cas 439]]

In [[Central London Property Trust v High Trees House [1947] KB 130]], Denning J formulated the doctrine. Where a promise was intended to create legal relations, and to the knowledge of the person making the promise was going to be acted upon by the person to whom it was made, and was acted on, then the promise was binding.

## Limitations

Judicial keenness to constrain it within strict parameters:

- Acts as shield, not a sword ([[Combe v Combe [1951] 2 KB 215]])
	- Used to justify PE flying in the face of one of the tenets of contract law (requirement for consideration).
- **Clear and unequivocal** promise that strict legal rights will not be fully enforced ([[Woodhouse A.C. Israel Cocoa Ltd v Nigerian Product Marketing Co Ltd [1972] AC 741]]).
	- Must be intended to affect legal relations, and not just a gratuitous privilege given.
	- Can be express or implied.
	- Detriment helps but not necessary for PE to apply
- Change in position in reliance on the promise (i.e. promisee relied on the promise/ [[representation]])
	- An act taking place before the promise cannot be in reliance on the promise
		- Exception - think about garage charging afterwards for repairs
		- [[Eastwood v Kenyon (1840) 11 A & E 438]]
	- Although promise need not be only reason for promisee's change in position, must have influenced their conduct in some way
	- Where promisee has conducted himself in the way intended by the promisor, up to the promisor to establish that the conduct was not induced by the promise
	- For part-payment of debt, debate as to whether part-payment can itself be the act of reliance, or if some other act of reliance needed.
	- There needs to be a causal link between the promise and the reliance ([[Brikom Investments Ltd v Carr [1979] QB 467]])
- In [[Alan & Co Ltd v El Nasr Export & Import Co [1972] 2 WLR 800]], Lord Denning MR stated that, although it was essential that the promisee should have acted on the promise, it was not essential that he should have acted on it to his detriment.
- Inequitable to let the promisor go back on their promise
	- Since this is an equitable doctrine, its use is at the discretion of the courts. Even if all elements of doctrine are made out, still may not be applied
	- Lord Goff in [[The Post Chaser [1981] 2 Lloyd's Rep 693]]:

	>"it does not follow in every case in which the representee has acted, or failed to act in reliance on the representation, it will be inequitable for the representor to enforce his rights"

	- e.g. [[D & C Builders v Rees [1966] 2 QB 617]]

## Implication for Legal Rights

Promisor's right to resume their strict legal rights may arise in one of two ways:

- Right to periodic payments may resume once the period over which the promissory estoppel operates ceases ([[Central London Property Trust v High Trees House [1947] KB 130]])
- Promisor may resume their full legal rights after giving reasonable notice of their intention to do so ([[Tool Metal v Tungsten [1955] 1 WLR 761]])

General intention to suspend rights concerned, not extinguish. Sometimes to have an outcome which is just and equitable, a past right can be extinguished. Exceptionally, rights could be extinguished where it has become impossible for the other party to meet the obligation concerned/ would be clearly inequitable to demand this.

In cases of post-breach representations or where it is not possible or practicable to return the parties to their original position, then promissory estoppel may have permanent effects. The precise effect of estoppel will depend very much open the facts of the individual case and upon the exercise by the trial judge at his or her discretion.

The judge may decide it would be inequitable to permit the promisor to go back on its promise at all, or that it would be inequitable to permit the promisor to go back on its promise without giving reasonable notice.

See also [[Collier v P & M Wright (Holdings) Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 1329]], Arden LJ:

>  (1) a debtor offers to pay part only of the amount he owes;  
>  (2) the creditor **voluntarily** accepts that offer, and  
>  (3) in reliance on the creditor’s acceptance the debtor pays that part of the amount he owes in full,  
>  the creditor will, by virtue of the doctrine of promissory estoppel, be bound to accept that sum in full and final satisfaction of the whole debt. For him to resile will of itself be inequitable. In addition, in these circumstances, the promissory estoppel has the effect of extinguishing the creditor’s right to the balance of the debt.

Distinguish Foaker v Beer where there was only the *promise* of part payment of the debt, an also that the acceptance was completely voluntarily. But this is super controversial, don't read too much into this.

Kitchin LJ in [[MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 553]]: it was not the case that

> ‘in every case where a creditor agrees to accept pay-ment of a debt by instalments, and the debtor acts upon that agreement by paying one of the instalments, and the creditor accepts that instalment, then it will necessarily be inequitable for the creditor later to go back upon the agreement and insist on payment of the balance.’

Note that the Europeans don't have consideration! Is English law really ready to abandon the requirement of a bargain in favour of the more nebulous requirement of mere agreement though?

In general, if the doctrine of promissory estoppel applies it will only suspend rights. Which one of the following cases added the proviso that the promise will be irrevocable if the promisee cannot resume his original position? Ajayi v Briscoe.
