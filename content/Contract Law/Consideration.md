# Consideration

## Definition

> An act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought, and the promise thus given for value is enforceable.  
> Frederick Pollock

Definition adopted by House of Lords in [[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge Ltd [1915] AC 847]]. Uses the concept of exchange; in order to be able to enforce a promise, must show you agreed to provide something in return. See [[Blue v Ashley [2017] EWHC 1928 (Comm)]].

Consideration can be [[Executory consideration]] or [[Executed consideration]].

Consideration plays the principal role in selecting those agreements to be given the 'badge of enforceability'. It is based on the idea of 'reciprocity'.

## Rules Governing Consideration

### 1. Consideration Must Not Be Past

Generally not possible to use as consideration some act or forbearance which has taken place prior to promise to pay ([[Eastwood v Kenyon (1840) 11 A & E 438]]).

#### Exception

When prior act or service was provided by the promisee at the promisor's request and it was always understood that payment would be made for that act or service ([[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614]]).

Lord Scarman identified 3 necessary conditions for the exception to apply:

1. Act done at promisor's request
2. Parties must have understood that the act was to be rewarded either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit. So either it was expressly agreed there would be some reward/ benefit, or such an understanding could be implied.
3. Payment, or conferment of other benefits, must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance.

Exception may be more apparent than real. Conditions indicate that at some point during the request, the act was done at person A's request with an understanding of reward/ benefit. But at this stage, could view things as a simple contract, where later precise value to be paid is fixed (e.g., this is the case when taking a car to the garage and leaving final price to be decided after completion of repairs). Recognising such arrangements as contractually binding is just reflecting the reasonable expectations of the parties.

### 2. Consideration Must Move From the Promisee

Means that a party who has not provided consideration may not bring an action to enforce a contract ([[Tweddle v Atkinson (1861) 1 B&S 393]]). Related to the doctrine of [[Privity of contract]].

Note that this is distinct from saying that consideration is needed for a valid contract. Note that there is no requirement that consideration must move from the promisor: the promisee can provide consideration by conferring a benefit on a third party at the request of the promisor.

Note that viewed through the lens of practical benefit and detriment, consideration did move from the promisee in [[Williams v Roffey Bros & Nichol (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1]].

Also note that the [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]] gives a third party a right to enforce a term of the contract. Technically, the rule that consideration must move from the promisee has not been changed since the third party is not, in the language of the Act, a party to the contract, she has simply been given a right to sue to enforce a term of the contract. But the substance of the rule has been revised.

### 3. Consideration Need Not Be Adequate

According to the doctrine of freedom of contract, courts will not interfere with a bargain freely reached by the parties ([[Chappel v Nestle [1960] AC 87]]). If agreement reached freely, inadequacy of price is immaterial.

Lord Somervell:

> “A contracting party can stipulate for what consideration he chooses. A peppercorn does not cease to be good consideration if it is established that the promisee does not like pepper and will throw away the corn”

### 4. Consideration Must Be Sufficient

Consideration must have some value 'in the eyes of the law'. So if a thing of value can be identified, then there is sufficiency of consideration ([[Thomas v Thomas (1842) 2 QB 851]])

See [[Existing obligation]].

## Doctrine of Consideration

> [!info]
> 
> From Contract Law, McKendrick

As the law of contract has developed, the functions of the doctrine of consideration have gradually changed. During the 19th Century, the doctrines of offer and acceptance and intention to create legal relations were superimposed upon the 16th Century requirement of consideration and made to perform the same functions. Now the judiciary adopt a more flexible approach, such as in [[Williams v Roffey Bros & Nichol (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1]]. Russel LJ: 'the courts nowadays should be more ready to find its existence so as to reflect the intention of the parties to the contract where the bargaining powers are not unequal and where the finding of consideration reflects the true intention of the parties' (controversial).
