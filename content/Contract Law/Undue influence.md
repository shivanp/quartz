# Undue influence

> If consent to a transaction was produced in a way such that the consent ought not fairly to be treated as an expression of a person's free will, then the transaction will not be allowed to stand.  
-[[RBS v Etridge (No 2) [2002] 2 AC 773]]

Developed by the courts of equity (as opposed to duress). The objective is to ensure that influence of one person over another is not abused.

Practically, where doubt as to whether any particular act of coercion is duress or undue influence, claimant should bring action on both grounds.

## Categorisation

In [[RBS v Etridge (No 2) [2002] 2 AC 773]] court set out two types of undue influence:

1. Instances of overt acts of improper pressure or coercion such as unlawful threats (overlap with duress)
	- Cases rare, most would today probably be decided on basis of duress
	- Same causation test for duress (deceitful/fraudulent nature: necessary for innocent party to establish that undue influence is a factor in inducing claimant to enter into contract. Otherwise, 'but for' test)
2. Situations where one party has influence or ascendancy over the other, and the first party takes advantage of that influence/ ascendancy. The underlying relationship is sufficient for the undue influence to be exercised.
	- Commonly comes from trust/confidence, or where one party is very vulnerable/ dependent.
	- In many relationships (parent-child, guardian-ward, trustee-beneficiary, solicitor-client, doctor-patient), there is an irrebuttable presumption that one party has influence over the other
	- Parent-adult child and husband-wife relationships do not give rise to this presumption, so influence needs to be positively shown.

## Proof of Taking Advantage of influence/ascendancy

For a party to prove it has been the victim of undue influence, needs to show:

1. There is a relationship of trust and confidence (or one of the irrebuttable presumption categories), and
2. There is a 'transaction which requires explanation' (suspicious/ suspiciously high value)

Then the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to produce evidence that there was no undue influence. If not produced, undue influence established.

### Common Cases

The business owner wants the spouse to enter into an agreement so spouse's share in matrimonial home used as security for a loan to the business owner's business. This is not a transaction which requires explanation, so the party alleging undue influence would need to prove that unfair advantage had been taken of the relationship.

Where a small gift is made to a person standing in a confidential relationship to the donor, proof of the exercise of influence must be given – the mere existence of the influence is not enough.

The court has made it clear that even if someone fully understands a transaction having received independent legal advice, still possible their consent has only been given as a result of undue influence.

## Limits of Equitable Relief

Where undue influence proven, contract (or gift by deed) may be set aside. But equitable remedy, so discretionary. Court might withhold:

- When an innocent party has delayed making claim ('delay defeats equity')
- Where claimant's conduct has been underhand ('he who comes to equity must come with clean hands')

Another fun example: [[Curtis v Curtis [2011] EWCA Civ 1602]].

Is the basis of these doctrines the inequality between the parties, the unfair nature of the terms, the knowing taking advantage of the weakness of another or some combination of these factors? Blair j in [[ Strydom v Vendside Ltd [2009] EWHC 2130 (QB); [2009] All ER (D) 135 (Aug)]]:

> ‘One party has to have been disadvantaged in some relevant way as regards the other party, that other party must have exploited that disadvantage in some morally culpable manner, and the resulting transaction must be overreaching and oppressive’.

## Undue Influence and Third Parties

Undue influence has in the past been largely confined to where a victim is attempting to avoid a transaction because the other party has exerted an unfair advantage over them by virtue of their relationship to one another. But a situation sometimes arises where the victim is persuaded to enter into a guarantee/surety contract with a bank or some other creditor on the basis of some undue influence, misrepresentation, or other wrong by a third party.

Question of what happens when bank is aware/ should be aware of undue influence in a transaction. When will the bank be fixed with constructive notice of undue influence (i.e., treated as having notice of something it is not actually aware of)?

### Spouses and a Bank

Principles for dealing with this common situation laid out in [[Barclays Bank plc v O'Brien [1994] 1 AC 180]]. Key is that if the bank is aware of the relationship between parties and fails to take “reasonable steps” to warn the spouse of the risks/ ensure they get independent advice, then the transaction will be set aside.

The House of Lords again considered the situation in appeal of [[RBS v Etridge (No 2) [2002] 2 AC 773]], Lord Nicholls said:

> 'the only practical way forward is to regard banks as put on inquiry in every case where the relationship between surety and debtor is non-commercial'.

Confirmed approach from [[CIBC Mortgages plc v Pitt [1994] 1 AC 200]], where bank entitled to secure payment of arrears since nothing to suggest undue influence (mortgage paper signed as being in order to buy holiday cottage).

### “Reasonable steps”

The purpose is to ensure innocent party fully aware of risks taken, and advise them to take independent advice. Lord Nicholls:

- No obligation on creditor to have seen wife itself. For a solicitor to determine whether there is a conflict of interest if the wife's solicitor also advises the husband.
- The creditor must provide solicitor with sufficient information about the transaction for the solicitor to fully explain to the wife.
- If the creditor is aware that the wife may have been misled, the creditor must tell solicitor this.

### Solicitor's Position

The solicitor should start by warning the wife that his involvement may be relied upon by the bank to counter allegations that she could not properly understand the transaction or had given her consent to this. Then if wife consents to being given advice:

- Explanation of documents and consequences, including risk of wife losing home
- Seriousness of the risk, including duration and terms of security and wife's assets and means
- Fact that wife has a choice.

If the solicitor fails to do this, she can have an action of negligence against them, but no recourse to the creditor.
