# Duress

Independent consent to the contract has not been given; one of the parties has coerced the other into the contract. Accordingly the contracts given are not allowed to stand - contracts entered into under duress are voidable (meaning that wronged party may be able to take action to have it set aside and parties returned to original position).

Developed by common law courts.

## Types

3 types of duress:

1. Duress to the person
2. Duress to property
3. [[Economic duress]]

Historically confined to threats of or acts of violence (duress to the person)

### Duress to the Person

Leading case is [[Barton v Armstrong [1976] AC 104]]. Privy Council established that if physical threats contributed to decision to enter into contract, duress will be found (so long as threats were one of the reasons for contracting).

Burden of proof on the party exerting the pressure to show the threats and unlawful pressure contributed nothing to victim's decision to contract. So causation test for duress not a difficult one to overcome.

### Duress to Goods

Contract can be voided when there is a threat to seize owner's property or damage it ([[Occidental Worldwide v S Avanti (The Sibeon & The Sibotre) [1976] 1 Lloyds Rep 293.]] - no duress here because false [[Misrepresentation]]).

To establish duress to goods higher burden of proof: must be shown that agreement would *not* have been entered into if there had not been the duress.

Showing duress being one factor but not a decisive factor is unlikely to be sufficient to establish duress to goods.

Duress to property basically the same.

## Legal Effect

Entering into contract through duress means not entering into it out of free will. Party subject to duress may choose to avoid the contract after the duress has ceased. Proper remedy: [[Rescission]].

Note not void but voidable: only if claimant wants to take action.
