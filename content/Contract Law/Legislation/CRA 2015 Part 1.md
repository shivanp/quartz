	- i.e., should meet the standard that a reasonable person would consider satisfactory (s 34(2))
	- RP would consider description, price, all other relevant circumstances
	- Such circumstances include 'any public statement about specific characteristics of the digital content made by the trader, the producer, or any representative of the trader or producer' (s 34(5))

- when deciding to enter into contract, or
- when making any decision about the service after entering into the contract

## Additional Remedies

CRA 2015 specifies remedies for consumers when terms breached. These sit alongside remedies available to the consumer under general law.

### Contracts for Goods

Where goods sold to consumer fail to meet requirements of s 9, s 10 or s 11, then goods required as non-conforming. Three remedies available to consumer:

- Short term right to reject
	- Usually available for 30 days from time
		- That ownership has passed, and
		- The goods have been delivered, and
		- In cases where trader required to install goods/ take other setup steps, trader has notified consumer that required steps have been taken (s 22)
- Right to repair or replacement
	- Available unless impossible or disproportionate (unreasonable cost to trader relative to consumer interests and other remedies) (s 23)
- Right to price reduction or final right to reject
	- Not entitled to both
	- In either case, can only be exercised where
		- After one repair or replacement, goods do not conform to contract
		- Consumer cannot request repair or replacement since impossible/ disproportionate
		- Consumer has required trader to repair or replace goods, but trader in breach of requirement to do so in reasonable time without significant inconvenience to consumer (s 24)
		- General rule: where final right to reject exercised within 6 months (clock running as with short term right to reject), should be full refund with no deduction for use (s 24(10)). Does not apply to motor vehicles and some other exceptions.

Consumers cannot treat the contract as at an end as a result of a breach of a term implied by s 9, 10 or 11, save to the extent set out above. So implied terms are neither conditions nor warranties; the extent to which breach gives rise to the right to treat contract as at an end set out in the Act.

### Contracts for Digital Goods

s 42: Where digital content is non-conforming in breach of terms implied by s 34, s 35 or s 36: two remedial options available:

- Right to repair or replacement
	- Within reasonable time and without significant inconvenience (s 43(2)(a)) (judged by nature and purpose of digital content (s 43(5)))
	- When not impossible/ disproportionate (s 43(3))
- Right to price reduction
	- Only exercisable where consumer cannot require repair or replacement (impossible or disproportionate), or where trader has failed to replace/repair within reasonable time and without significant inconvenience (s 44)

s 45: Consumer has a right to receive a refund of all money paid for the digital content. Refund must be given in 14 days, using same payment method, without imposing any fee.

Digital content which does not conform to the contract at any time within 6 months, beginning with the day on which supplied, must be taken not to have conformed to the contract when it was supplied (s 42(9)).

Similar to with goods, consumers cannot treat the contract as at an end as a result of a breach of a term.

s 46: Where

- Trader supplies digital content to consumer under contract
- Digital content causes damage to device or other digital content
- Device or digital content damaged belongs to consumer
- Damage of a kind which would not have occurred if trader had exercised reasonable care and skill  
then consumer entitled to repair/ compensatory payment.

### Contracts for Services

Where services non-conforming in breach of s 49 (reasonable care and skill), two remedial options available:

- Right to require repeat performance
	- Reasonable time and without significant inconvenience (s 55(2)(a))
	- Not if impossible (s 55(3))
- Right to price reduction (s 56(3))
	- When repeat performance impossible
	- Or when trader has failed to provide repeat performance within reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to consumer

Where the services are non-conforming in breach of the term implied by s 52 (performance within a reasonable time) the remedial option is the right to a price reduction.
