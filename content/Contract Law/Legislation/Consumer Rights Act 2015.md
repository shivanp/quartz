Applies to contracts between a [[Trader]] and a [[Consumer]].

s 2(4) says that where a trader claims that an individual was not acting for purposes wholly or mainly outside the individual's trade, business, craft or profession, then it is for the trader to prove it.

> Contracts between a consumer and business entered into prior to 1/10/15 governed by Sales of Goods Act 1979, Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 and Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

s 48(2) states that contracts of employment are **not** covered by the Act.
