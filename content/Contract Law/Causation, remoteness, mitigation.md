# Causation, remoteness, mitigation

- Damages can only be recovered if they are caused by the breach.
- Damages cannot be recovered if they are too remote from the breach.
- Damages can be reduced if the claimant has failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate its losses.

## Causation

The claimant must establish a causal link between the defendant's breach of contract and its loss in order to recover damages. Means assessing:

- Whether the breach by the defendant has caused the loss suffered by the claimant
- Whether as a matter of law the defendant should be held responsible.

Go back to [[Factual causation]] and [[Legal causation]].

### Factual Causation

The courts have treated the determination of factual causation broadly, advocating a common sense approach ([[Galoo Ltd v Bright Grahame Murray [1994] 1 WLR 1360]]). The defendant's breach should be a 'dominant' or 'effective' cause of the loss if that loss is to be recoverable.

### Legal Causation

The claim will fail if legal causation is not established; if there is a *novus actus interveniens* ([[Lambert v Lewis [1982] AC 225]]).

If the intervening event was 'likely to happen', this will not generally break the chain of causation ([[Monarch Steamship Co Ltd v AB Karlshamns Oljefabriker [1949] AC 196]]).

## Remoteness

**Key case**: [[Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341]].

Baron Alderson set out the test to be applied:

> “Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may [1] fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or [2] such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it.”

This rule has two parts:

- Loss of a type ordinarily and naturally arising from the breach is not based on actual knowledge of the particular parties.
	- Looks at the 'usual course of things'
	- If the loss is deemed a normal type of loss which would follow from the breach then it will be recoverable under the first limb of the *Hadley v Baxendale* test.
- If losses are too unusual and far reaching to satisfy the first limb, to recover the claimant will have to establish that the particular defendant had sufficient actual knowledge of the particular and special circumstances to be aware of the risk of those losses.

The rationale for remoteness is to limit the recoverable losses to those that a contracting party would or should have been aware of as being likely to flow from the breach, because these are the risks that the contracting party could be said to have accepted upon entering into a contract.

 Lord Hoffman in [[Transfield Shipping Inc of Panama v Mercator Shipping Inc of Monrovia, The Achilleas [2009] 1 AC 61]]:

> "It seems to me logical to found liability for damages upon the intention of the parties (objectively ascertained) because all contractual liability is voluntarily undertaken"

In this framework:

- The first limb helps to identify risks a contracting party should/ would have known about because they usually materialise;
- The second limb points to risks that a contracting party should/ would have known about due to particular information communicated to them.

In [[Jackson v Royal Bank of Scotland [2005] UKHL 3]], the House of Lords confirmed that what was in the contemplation of the parties was to be judged at the time of contracting, rather than at the time of the breach.

Key case for this remoteness test: [[Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd [1949] 2 KB 528]].

## Mitigation

Where one party has suffered loss resulting from the other party's breach of contract, the injured party should take 'reasonable steps' to minimise the effect of the breach ([[British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co v Underground Electric Rail Co [1912] AC 673]]).

There is no obligation for the claimant to mitigate their loss, but losses attributable to a failure to do so are not legally recoverable. So the innocent party cannot seek compensation by the party in default for the loss which is due to the failure to behave reasonably after the breach.

The question of which steps count as 'reasonable' is one of fact ([[Pilkington v Wood [1953] CH 770]]). It was held that there was no expectation that the claimant should embark on 'a complicated and difficult piece of litigation' in order to minimise the effects of the defendant's breach.

[[Payzu v Saunders [1919] 2 KB 581]]: reasonable steps to mitigate may in some circumstances, including accepting the performance offered by the defendant under a new contract even when performance amounts to a breach of the original contract.

If the defendant's offer of performance remains the best substitute performance (as it was in *Payzu*) then it would seem unreasonable not to go to that source.

[[Banco de Portugal v Waterlow & Sons [1932] AC 452]] establishes that when considering whether the claimant has taken reasonable steps to mitigate, the claimant's actions 'ought not to be weighed in nice scales at the instance of the party whose breach of contract has occasioned the difficulty'.

There is no duty to mitigate a claim for a payment of a debt. This includes a claim for liquidated damages. This is because the amount is payable as a contractual right rather than as damages.
