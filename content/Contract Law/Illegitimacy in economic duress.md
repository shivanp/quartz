# Illegitimacy in economic duress

## Other Illegitimacy Points

In [[R v A-G for England and Wales [2003] UKPC 22]] Lord Hoffman stated that the legitimacy of the pressure must be examined from 'two aspects', namely the 'nature of the pressure and … the nature of the demand which the pressure is applied to support'. This almost gives us a two stage test for illegitimacy:

- If the threat is unlawful, it generally amounts to duress
	- Therefore, the threat to commit a crime, a tort or a breach of contract, will generally amount to the application of illegitimate pressure (see [[Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614]])
	- It is not true that every threatened breach of contract amounts to the application of illegitimate pressure: it may be that only bad faith breaches of contract will be classified as illegitimate for this purpose.
		- Relying on bad faith has its own problems: it can be difficult to identify what constitutes bad faith.
		- Burrows: ‘a threatened breach of contract should be regarded as illegitimate if concerned to exploit the claimant’s weakness rather than solving financial or other problems of the defendant’.
			- A threat should not be considered illegitimate if the threat is a reaction to circumstances that almost constitute frustration
			- Or if the threat merely corrects what was always a bad bargain.
		- But English law generally doesn't invoke notions of bad faith in the context of breach of contract.
		- An intermediate approach, adopted by Christopher Clarke J in [[Kolmar Group AG v Traxpo Enterprises PVT Ltd [2010] EWHC 113]], is to conclude that ‘a threat to break a contract will generally be regarded as illegitimate, particularly where the defendant must know that it would be in breach of contract if the threat were implemented’.
		- So bad faith helps, but a breach threatened in good faith can still constitute an illegitimate threat in appropriate cases.
- If the threat is lawful but is used to support a demand which is unlawful, it may constitute duress.
	- e.g., in the case of blackmail, the threat itself is lawful (to make something public), but it is used to attain a goal which is unlawful.
	- But the general rule is that a defendant who threatens to do what he is entitled to do will not be held to have applied illegitimate pressure upon the claimant.
		- So a refusal to waive existing contractual obligations should not amount to duress because of the absence of a wrongful threat ([[Alec Lobb v Total Oil [1983] 1WLR 87]]).
		- A demand for payment made by an owner of goods as the price for not exercising his right to repossess the goods has also been held not to constitute duress ([[Alf Vaughan & Co Ltd v Royscot Trust plc [1999] 1 All ER (Comm) 856]]).
		- It is not duress for a creditor who believes he has an accrued cause of action against a debtor to threaten to bring proceedings, even if the result is likely to be disastrous for the debtor, and even if the creditor spells out in strong language why it will be disastrous for the debtor for him to do so ([[Holyoake v Candy [2017] EWHC 3397 (Ch)]]).
		- A threat to refuse contract should not constitute duress since in the absence of an obligation to enter into contract, no wrongful threat has been made.
	- However, where A uses lawful pressure to induce B to concede a demand to which A does not bona fide believe itself to be entitled, B’s agreement is voidable on the grounds of economic duress.
		- But this concerns a demand which has not been made in good faith.
		- There will not be duress if A genuinely but unreasonably believed its demand to be well-founded.
		- So economic duress does not extend to the use of lawful pressure to achieve a result to which the person exercising the pressure believes in good faith it is entitled, whether or not that belief is objectively reasonably held.
	- The onus of proof is on the party alleging that there has been a lack of good faith. This is likely to keep lawful act duress within narrow confines.

Where does [[Williams v Roffey Bros & Nichol (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1]] sit? Duress was not pleaded in this case, so hard to analyse. But most people feel content with the conclusion that there was no duress on the facts of the case:

1. The main contractors who called the meeting made the offer to pay more;
2. The claimant was obviously incompetent: he could not supervise his workforce, nor cost the job properly.  
But how can incompetence be differentiated from a contractor deliberately pricing the job too low and then trying to ask for more money? This suggests duress is not yet developed enough to take on the role given to it as a check in Glidewell's criteria.

A contract which is entered into under duress is voidable ([[North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Hyundai Construction Co Ltd and Another (The Atlantic Baron) [1979] QB 705]]). This means that it is necessary for the party alleging duress to take steps to set aside the agreement. A failure to do this in a reasonable time can lead to the conclusion that the agreement has been affirmed, so cannot be set aside. This is because rescission is an equitable remedy.
