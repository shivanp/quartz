# Misrepresentation categories

## Categories of Misrepresentation

Once the elements of an actionable misrepresentation have been established, the remedies available depend on the category of the misrepresentation in question.

Under [Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/7), the categories of misrepresentation available are:

Category | Legal basis | Test
---|---|---
Fraudulent | Tort of deceit | Representee to prove that representor made the statement knowing it was untrue/ without believing it to be true/ reckless as to the truth
Negligent | s 2(1) MA 1967 | Representor fails to show reasonable grounds to believe true/ not believing true up until contract made
Innocent | s 2(1) MA 1967 | Representor has shown reasonable grounds to believe, and actual belief up until contract made

### Fraudulent Misrepresentation

Defined by Lord Herschell in [[Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 337]]:

>"First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (a) knowingly, or (b) without belief in its truth, or (c) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states…Thirdly, if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial. It matters not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the statement was made."

'Recklessness' was defined in [[Thomas Witter Ltd v TBP Industries Ltd [1996] 2 All ER 573]], where it was established that to find fraud, the level of recklessness required was 'flagrant disregard for the truth'.

#### Change in Circumstances

It can be difficult categorising a misrepresentation based on change of circumstances. Lord Wright MR in [[With v O'Flanagan [1936] Ch 575]]:

>“…the Court is more reluctant to use the word “fraud” and would not generally use the word “fraud” in that connection because the failure to disclose, though wrong and a breach of duty, may be due to inadvertence or a failure to realise that the duty rests upon the party who has made the representation not to leave the other party under an error when the representation has become falsified by a change of circumstances”

So the Court would need to be satisfied that failure to disclose was deliberate/dishonest.

#### Burden of Proof

The burden of proof on the claimant to prove fraudulent representation is a difficult burden to discharge: allegations of fraud taken very seriously.

### Negligent Misrepresentation

Section 2(1) of the MA 1967 provides:

>“Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.”

So defendant liable for negligent misrepresentation unless they can prove they had reasonable grounds to believe, and did believe up until the time of the contract, that the statement was true.

Where a representor is found liable for a negligent misrepresentation, they will be treated to all intents and purposes as if he had made a fraudulent misrepresentation ([[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson [1991] 2 QB 297]] but widely criticised). This has ramifications for damages.

See also [[Howard Marine and Dredging Co. Ltd. v A. Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd. [1978] 2 WLR 515]].

Important to note that the statutory right to damages for negligent misrepresentation reverses the normal burden of proof by requiring the representor (defendant) to prove that they had reasonable grounds to believe their statement, and did believe their statement.

Note that it is difficult for a defendant to get their misrepresentation downgraded from negligent to innocent, because the courts want to discourage people from making statements without checking/ thinking about their validity.

### Innocent Misrepresentation

An innocent misrepresentation is one which is not made fraudulently or negligently. It is a statement made where the representor:

- Proves they had reasonable grounds for belief in the truth of their statement
- Proves that they believed up to the time of contract that what they were saying is true.

It is defined in s 2(1)[Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/7)
