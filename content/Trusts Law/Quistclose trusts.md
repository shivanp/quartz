# Quistclose trusts

## Bank Deposits

> [!important]
> A bank is not a trustee of money deposited by its customers. Rather it is a debtor in respect of those deposits.

Key case: [[Foley v Hill (1848) 11 HLC 2]]

Lord Cottenham LC:

> Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal. […] The money placed in the custody of a banker is, to all intents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases; he is guilty of no breach of trust in employing it; he is not answerable to the principal if he puts it into jeopardy, if he engages in a hazardous speculation; he is not bound to keep it or deal with it as the property of his principal, but he is of course answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having received that money.

Thus, a debt is a different legal concept from a trust. But they are not mutually exclusive. They  
can be combined in a single transaction.

## Quistclose Trust

The best example of a device which combines a debt and a trust is a “Quistclose trust”. The name derives from the case in which such arrangements were first recognised: [[Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567]].

This was applied in [[Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12]]. Twinsectra is the most important case on Quistclose trusts as it makes clear that it is not sufficient to demonstrate that money was advanced to the borrower for a particular purpose. Rather, it is necessary to demonstrate the parties’ mutual intention that the money could only be applied for the purpose and was not at the free disposal of the borrower. It is this feature of the transaction which generates the trust in favour of the lender.  

> [!tip]
> A Quistclose trust does not arise where money is paid for a purpose but is at the recipient’s free disposal.

Twinsectra also provides helpful guidance on the requirement for certainty of purpose:  

1. The borrower’s power to apply the money is valid only if the purpose is sufficiently certain.  
2. A purpose is certain if it is possible to determine whether any given application the money does or does not fall within it.  
3. If the purpose is uncertain, the borrower cannot make any use of the money and simply holds it on trust for the lender.

## Operation of Quistclose Trust

- When the lender advances the money to the borrower, the borrower holds the money on trust for the lender, with a power to use it for a specified purpose.  
- To the extent that the borrower uses the money for the purpose, the lender’s equitable interest is extinguished. The relationship changes from trustee-beneficiary to debtor-creditor.  
- To the extent that the borrower applies the money for any other purpose, the borrower commits a breach of trust. The lender can assert their equitable proprietary interest in the misapplied money (or its traceable proceeds).  
- If it becomes impossible to apply the money for the purpose, the borrower must return the money to the lender.

## Other Contexts

It is worth noting that although most of the case law involves loans or transactions involving money, Quistclose trusts are not restricted to such circumstances. They arise in any situation where property is transferred to a person whose use of the property is restricted to a specified purpose: to any case where the property is not at the free disposal of the transferee. ([[Ali v Dinc [2020] EWHC 3055 (Ch)]], paras 234, 238).
