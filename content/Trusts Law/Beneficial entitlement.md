# Beneficial entitlement

## Introduction

With the exception of [[purpose trusts]] (which are not considered in this element) trusts must have a beneficiary or beneficiaries. The trustee(s) hold the trust property for the beneficiaries and owe obligations to them.

The nature of those obligations, and the correlative rights of the beneficiaries, depend on the type of trust.

This element explores beneficial entitlement, focusing on the difference between the rights of beneficiaries under fixed trusts and discretionary trusts. It also compares discretionary trusts with powers of appointment.

## Fixed Trusts

> [!defn]
> A fixed trust (also described as a ‘fixed interest trust’) is a trust in which the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor.

The trustees have no discretion in relation to the distribution of the trust property. They must distribute as directed by the settlor. This direction takes place at the time the trust is created. The settlor cannot tell the trustees what to do once the trust has come into effect, unless they have reserved a power to do so.

A fixed trust can have one or more beneficiaries, and those beneficiaries may have very different entitlements in respect of the trust property.

### Sole Beneficiary

The simplest example of a fixed trust involves the trustee(s) holding the entire trust property for one beneficiary.

The trustee has the legal right to deal with the trust property as owner, but they must exercise this right for the beneficiary.

The beneficiary has personal rights against the trustee and can sue to enforce them. They also have an equitable proprietary interest in the trust property. They are the sole beneficial owner of the trust property (including any income produced by that property).

### Beneficiaries with Fixed Shares

A fixed trust can also have multiple beneficiaries.

> [!example]
> A simple example is a trust where the trust property is held for A and B in equal shares. As with the previous example, this is a fixed trust because the beneficial entitlement is fixed by the settlor and the trustees have no discretion as to how the trust property is distributed.
> 
> Both beneficiaries have proprietary rights in the trust property, and both have personal rights against the trustee to enforce the trust. Together, they are entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the trust property, but separately each is only entitled to a 50% share (of both capital and income).

> [!example]
> 
> The following are all further examples of fixed trusts:
> - A fund on trust for A and B in the proportions 60% and 40% respectively
> - A house on trust for A for life, remainder to B
> - A house on trust for A for life, remainder to B and C in equal shares
> - A house on trust for A for life, remainder to B if he survives A and, if not, to C
> 
> The first example is very similar to our previous example, but in this case the shares of the beneficiaries are unequal. The trustees must therefore distribute any income in the appropriate proportions and distribute the capital in the same proportions when the trust comes to an end.
> 
> The remaining examples are more complicated. They are known as ‘successive interest trusts’ and give some beneficiaries a right to income while others are entitled to capital.

### Successive Interest Trusts

A common example is a ‘life interest trust’ which involves a beneficiary (often described as the ‘life tenant’) receiving income during their lifetime, with another beneficiary or beneficiaries (often described as the ‘remainderman’) being entitled to the capital after the life tenant’s death.

> [!example]
> ‘A house on trust to A for life, remainder to B’.
> 
> A receives the income produced by the house during their lifetime. When A dies, B receives the house itself. Together they hold the entire beneficial interest in the house, but A is only interested in the income and B is only interested in the capital.

This is a common way to leave property via will, as it allows testators to provide for their spouse but ensures that the spouse cannot disinherit their children when they die. In our example, A would have a right to live in the house during their lifetime but could not leave the house to anyone in their own will because they only have a life interest.

> [!example]
> Let’s remind ourselves of our other examples of successive interest trusts:
> - A house on trust for A for life, remainder to B and C in equal shares.
> - A house on trust for A for life, remainder to B if he survives A and, if not, to C.
> 
> Our first example is a combination of two examples we have looked at previously. In this case, A is entitled to the income produced by the trust property. When A dies, the capital is shared equally between B and C. Together, A, B and C have the entire beneficial interest in the trust property but A is only entitled to income while B and C are entitled to capital.
> 
> Our second example is more complicated as it involves a ‘contingent’ interest. As in the previous example, A is entitled to the income produced by the house. But what happens to the house on A’s death depends on whether B is still alive. If B is alive, B receives the house. If B has died, C receives the house. (If C has also died, C’s estate will receive it.)
> 
> Although it is not known from the outset of the trust whether B or C will receive the capital, this is still a fixed trust. There is a clear mechanism for determining who receives the capital. At the point when the capital must be distributed (A’s death), the trustees can determine entitlement.

## Discretionary Trusts

The trustees of fixed trusts do not have a discretion in relation to the distribution of the trust property. By way of contrast, the trustees of a discretionary trust do have a distributive discretion. Although the settlor determines the potential beneficiaries of the trust (known as the ‘objects’ of the trust), the trustees must determine who from which that class of objects is to receive what sum.

> [!note]
> Discretionary trusts are sometimes described as a "power in the nature of a trust".

Discretionary trusts are flexible. They enable a settlor to make provision for different beneficiaries according to their future needs.

The objects of a discretionary trust are only potential beneficiaries. They have no equitable interest in the trust property until the discretion is exercised in their favour. They do, however, have a right to ensure that the trustees exercise their powers properly.

> [!example]
> 
> Consider the example of settlor who leaves £10,000 in their will on discretionary trust for their wife and three children. The wife and children are the objects of the trust. It is up to the trustees to decide how to divide the property between them.
> 
> The trustees must exercise their discretion and must do so within a reasonable time. (The trust document may specify the time by which the discretion must be exercised. If not, what is ‘reasonable’ will be determined on the facts). If the trustees do not exercise their discretion, any of the objects can sue to enforce the trust and ensure that the discretion is exercised.
> 
> However, the objects cannot compel the exercise of the discretion in their favour as they do not have proprietary rights in the trust property. They merely have a hope that they will receive something.
> 
> The objects also have a right to ensure that the trust is administered properly. This means they can sue the trustees for breaches of trust such as improperly investing the trust fund or making distributions to non-objects. Any compensation awarded as a result of such a breach will be payable to the trust fund, not the claimant objects, as they do not have proprietary rights unless and until the discretion is exercised in their favour.

### Powers of Appointment

It is helpful to contrast discretionary trusts with powers of appointment.

A power of appointment is a right to choose who, from within a specified class of objects, receives property. The person who confers the power is the ‘donor’ of the power and the recipient is the ‘donee’.

The essence of a power is the donee’s complete discretion. They can choose whether to exercise the power at all. If exercised, they have absolute discretion as to which member(s) of the class of objects should benefit from its exercise.

Powers are not trusts, but it is common for trusts to include powers. Often (but not necessarily) the trustee will be the donee.

- A power given to a trustee is a fiduciary power. The trustee does not need to exercise it but must periodically consider whether to do so.
- A personal power is a power given to someone who is not a trustee. They are not even required to consider exercising it.

The objects of a power therefore have even more limited rights than the objects of a discretionary trust. They cannot compel the exercise of the power but can constrain an improper exercise.

#### Key Features

As we have seen, the key difference between a power of appointment and a discretionary trust is that there is no obligation on the donee to exercise a power of appointment, whereas the trustees of a discretionary trust must exercise their discretion.

Because a power does not have to be exercised, it is good practice for the donor to make clear what will happen to the property if it is not. This is sometimes described as a ‘gift-over’ in default of the exercise of the power.

When analysing an arrangement to determine whether it is a power of appointment or a discretionary trust, the following are helpful indicators:

- Imperative wording such as ‘must’ suggests a discretionary trust, whereas permissive wording such as ‘may’ suggests a power of appointment.
- If discretion has been given to a third party (not a trustee) it is a power of appointment, not a discretionary trust.
- The presence of a gift-over indicates a power of appointment (because it means the power does not need to be exercised) but lack of a gift-over is not determinative.

### Examples

> [!example] Example - discretionary trust
> ‘My trustees must distribute the trust fund between such of my children as they, in their absolute discretion, determine.’
> This bears all the hallmarks of a discretionary trust:
> - The discretion is held by the trustees.
> - The wording ‘in their absolute discretion’ indicates that the trustees have a distributive discretion.
> - The wording ‘must’ indicates that they are under an obligation to exercise their discretion.
> - There is no gift-over in default of exercise because the trustees are required to exercise their discretion.

> [!example] Example - personal power
> 
> ‘My trustees must distribute the trust fund between such of my children as my wife may determine within 12 months of my death and, if no such determination is made, in equal shares.’
> 
> The discretion conferred on the wife bears all the hallmarks of a power of appointment:
> - The power is held by a third party i.e. the settlor’s wife.
> - The word ‘may’ indicates that the wife is not under an obligation to exercise the power.
> - There is a gift-over in default of the exercise i.e. the property must be distributed in equal shares amongst the children if the wife does not exercise the power.
> 
> The trustees here hold no power at all. They must distribute as directed (either by the wife or in equal shares). Beneficial entitlement will be determined 12 months after the settlor’s death, or earlier if the wife exercises the power.

> [!example] Example - fiduciary power
> 
> ‘My trustees must hold the trust fund for my children in equal shares. During the trust period, my trustees may pay any or all of the trust fund to such of my wife and children as they see fit.’
> 
> This is another power of appointment but this time it is fiduciary in nature because it is held by trustees. The word ‘may’ indicates that the trustees are not under an obligation to exercise the power but they must hold the property on a fixed trust unless and until they exercise the power.
> 
> This is sometimes described as a fixed trust coupled with a power. The trustees hold the trust fund on a fixed trust for the children but also have the power to pay some or all of the property to a wider class of objects (the children or the wife). It is very common for trusts to be coupled with powers as it provides for a greater degree of flexibility but imposes no obligation on the trustees to actually exercise the power. It is there if needed but, if not, the property will be distributed in accordance with the terms of the fixed trust.

## Vested and Contingent Interests

- A **vested interest** is a current right to property. Nothing more needs to happen for the beneficiary to become entitled to the property.
- A **contingent interest** is conditional upon the occurrence of a future event (known as a ‘condition precedent’). Contingent interests become vested if the condition precedent is satisfied. The beneficiary has no entitlement unless and until the condition is satisfied.

Vested interests can also be defeated by a ‘condition subsequent’ meaning that the beneficiary’s interest is lost if the condition is satisfied. The beneficiary has an entitlement unless and until the condition is satisfied.

### Vested Interests

Vested interests may be subdivided into interests which are vested ‘in interest’ only and interests which are vested ‘in possession’.

- A beneficiary whose interest is ‘**vested in possession’** has a current right to current enjoyment of the property.
- A beneficiary whose interest is ‘**vested in interest’** has a current right to future enjoyment of the property.

A common example which involves both types of vested interest is a successive interest trust, involving both life and remainder interests.

> [!example]
> Take a situation where a house is held on trust for a woman for life, with the remainder to the woman’s son.
> 
> Both the woman and her son have vested interests:
> 
> - The woman’s interest is vested in possession. She has a current right to current enjoyment of the property.
> - Her son’s interest is vested in interest. He has a current right to the property but he is not entitled to the enjoyment of that property until the woman dies.
> 
> Note that the son’s interests is not contingent. He does not obtain the house if the woman dies but when she dies. You may query what will happen if the son dies before the woman. Is his interest not contingent on living longer than his mother? The answer is no. The son’s interest remains part of his estate (and can therefore pass under his will).

### Contingent Interests

> [!example]
> 
> Contrast the example above with the case where a settlor creates a trust of a house for a woman for life, remainder to her son if he survives her, and if not, to charity.
> 
> In this example the son’s interest is contingent. His interest will only vest if he is alive when his mother dies. His contingent interest cannot pass to his estate in these circumstances. As a result, the charity is entitled to the house on the woman’s death.
> 
> The provision in favour of the charity is known as a ‘gift-over’. It is a clear indication that the son’s interest was intended to be contingent.
> 
> Lack of a gift-over will not be fatal to the creation of a contingent interest. In this example, even without the gift-over, the use of the word ‘if’ makes it very clear that the son’s interest will not survive his death if he predeceases his mother. The remainder interest will return to the settlor on a resulting trust.

### Conditions Precedent and Subsequent

If an interest is subject to a condition precedent, the beneficiary does not obtain a vested interest unless and until the contingency is satisfied.

In a condition subsequent, the beneficiary has an immediate interest in the property, but this can be divested by the occurrence of a future event.

The difference between conditions precedent and subsequent can be crucial in affecting the beneficiary’s rights to income during the period between creation of the trust and the satisfaction of the condition.

> [!example]
> 
> Compare the following:
> - A trustee holds property on trust for an individual if the individual gets married.
> - A trustee holds property on trust for an individual for as long as the individual remains unmarried.
> 
> The first example is a condition precedent. The beneficiary’s interest is contingent. They are not entitled to receive the income from the trust unless and until they marry. (If they later marry, they may then receive the accumulated income along with the capital.)
> 
> The second example is a condition subsequent. The beneficiary’s interest is vested but defeasible. They are entitled to the income from the property unless and until they marry, when their entitlement to both the income and capital ceases.

## Rule in *Saunders V Vautier*

The reason it is important to distinguish between vested, contingent and defeasible interests is because they affect the ability of beneficiaries to exercise their rights to collapse the trust under the rule in [[Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav 115]].

The basic principle in *Saunders v Vautier* is that an adult beneficiary of sound mind, with an indefeasible vested interest in the trust property, is entitled to direct the trustee to transfer legal title to them, thereby bringing the trust to an end.

A beneficiary should only be able to do this if they are absolutely entitled to the trust property. If their interest is contingent or defeasible, they are not the only person who could receive that property, so they have no entitlement to have it transferred to them and become the absolute owner.

The decision in *Saunders v Vautier* itself demonstrates the importance of certainty as to whether an interest is vested or contingent (and therefore the need for clear drafting). In particular, it highlights that, although it is possible to create a contingent interest without a gift-over, it is advisable to include one to put the matter beyond doubt.

### Extension of *Saunders V Vautier*

#### Multiple Beneficiaries

Saunders has subsequently been extended to cases involving multiple beneficiaries. If each beneficiary has a distinct interest in the trust property, which can be severed without impacting the others, they can separately exercise their *Saunders v Vautier* rights.

A simple example is a fixed trust in equal shares, where one beneficiary is an adult and the other is a minor. As long as the trust fund is easily divisible, the adult beneficiary can require the trustee to transfer their share to them. They cease to be a beneficiary, and the remaining half of the fund is held entirely for the minor.

#### More Complicated Cases

*Saunders v Vautier* rights can also be exercised by the beneficiaries of more complicated fixed trusts, such as successive interest trusts. However, because the rights of the beneficiaries under such trusts are not easily severable, it can only be done if all the beneficiaries agree (and they must all satisfy the conditions relating to age and capacity).

In such circumstances, the beneficiaries may direct the trustee to transfer the trust fund to them (in such shares as they choose). This is because together they share the absolute beneficial interest in the fund.

The effect of the extensions above means that *Saunders v Vautier* rights are not strictly exercisable only by beneficiaries with indefeasible, vested interests. Beneficiaries with contingent or defeasible interests may exercise those rights, but only if they act together with all the other persons who share the beneficial interest in the property. In the case of contingent interests, this will include the objects of any gift-over.

This means that *Saunders v Vautier* can also be exercised by the objects of a discretionary trust or even the objects of a fiduciary power which has a gift-over in default of appointment. Even though none of the objects have vested interests in the trust property, together they can be treated as a single object in whom the interest subject to the discretion or power is vested. Again, as long as they are all adults of sound mind, they can agree to collapse the trust and share the property between them.

#### Practical Limitations

Practically speaking, this is very unlikely to happen, particularly in the case of large discretionary trusts where the objects may not all be identifiable, let alone able to reach a consensus. It is more likely to occur in the case of very small, private discretionary trusts (such as testamentary trusts for the children of the testator, who could decide to collapse the trust once they are all over 18).

Practical limitations mean that the right is unlikely to be exercised in very large or complex trusts. There are also legal limitations on the rule, which stem from the nature of the trust itself.

#### Legal Limitations

The rule in *Saunders v Vautier* acknowledges that the objects of trusts are the true owners of the property and should not be denied the right to manage their own property should they wish to. However, it does not mean that they are able to interfere in the administration of a trust while it subsists. They have a choice between the following:

- Exercising their *Saunders v Vautier* rights by directing the trustee to transfer the property out of the trust (whether to them or to a third party); or
- Remaining objects of the trust and allowing the trustees to continue to act in accordance with the terms of that trust.

If the beneficiaries are not happy with the administration of the trust, they may seek appropriate remedies (including removal and replacement of the trustee), but they cannot tell the trustee how to perform their role. If they wish to vary the trust terms, they could exercise their *Saunders v Vautier* rights and create a new trust on those terms.
