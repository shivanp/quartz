# McPhail v Doulton [1971] AC 424

## Abstract

The test to be applied in ascertaining the validity of a trust is whether or not it can be said with certainty that a given individual is or is not a member of the designated class. Per Lord Reid: If the trustees do not exercise a power, the court will do so in the manner best calculated to give effect to the settlor's or the testator's intentions. A settlement provided by cl. 9 (a) that "the trustees shall apply the net income … in making at their absolute discretion grants to or … of any of the officers or employees … as they think fit." Cl. 9 (b) provided that the trustees should not be bound to exhaust the income of any one year and cl. 10 provided that no person shall have any right to an interest other than in pursuance to the exercise of the trustees' discretion. Goff J. held that the deed had created a power from which decision an appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Held,

(1) that cl. 9(a) constituted a trust and the case would be remitted to the Chancery Division to determine whether it was void for uncertainty;

(2) that the test to be applied was that propounded in Gulbenkian.
