# Hunter v Moss [1993] 1 WLR 934

FACTS: The defendant was the registered shareholder of 950 ordinary shares in a company.  
He declared a trust of 50 of those shares for the plaintiff but did not identify them. The issue was whether the trust was valid or void for uncertainty of subject matter.  

HELD: There was a valid trust of 50 shares. Deputy judge, Colin Rimer QC distinguished  
London Wine. He reasoned that as every tangible asset is discrete, its physical properties may differ from those of other seemingly identical assets. This, he argued, is why it is necessary to specifically identify which tangible assets are to be held on trust.  

However, Rimer QC held that this rationale has no application to intangible assets of the same type (such as ordinary shares in the same company) because such assets really are identical.  
He said:  

> The defendant did not identify any particular 50 shares for the plaintiff because to do so was unnecessary and irrelevant. All 950 of his shares carried identical rights….The shares were … of such a nature that each of them could satisfy the trust just as well as any other of them. Why therefore should equity be concerned that 50 particular shares were not identified? … Any suggested uncertainty as to subject matter appears … to be theoretical and conceptual rather than real or practical.

## Abstract

A trust made by oral declaration is not void for uncertainty of subject matter merely because it refers to a number of shares in a company, and does not refer to specific shares. During the course of a trial, a defendant was held to have made an oral declaration that he held a number of shares, 50, on behalf of the plaintiff. He applied to the court to have the judgment set aside, arguing that the trust failed for lack of certainty as the particular 50 shares had not been identified.

Held, that an oral declaration of trust is sufficiently certain, if, immediately after it has been made, the court could have ordered execution of the trust. As the shares were indistinguishable from each other it was unnecessary for the particular shares involved to be identified (_[Kayford Ltd (In Liquidation), Re [1975] 1 W.L.R. 279, [1974] 10 WLUK 15](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID1D22A80E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ee6b0bcded034a63b7a5b43a27a01f86&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered; _[London Wine Co (Shippers), Re [1986] P.C.C. 121, [1986] 1 WLUK 731](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70C81A60E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ee6b0bcded034a63b7a5b43a27a01f86&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Andrabell, Re [1984] 3 All E.R. 407, [1984] 6 WLUK 58](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I32DFB6E1E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ee6b0bcded034a63b7a5b43a27a01f86&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished).
