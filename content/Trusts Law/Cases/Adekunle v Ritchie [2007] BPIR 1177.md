# Adekunle v Ritchie [2007] BPIR 1177

FACTS: A mother and her youngest son (who lived with her) bought a house in joint names. In order to purchase the house, it was necessary to have the mortgage in their joint names as the mother was unemployed and could therefore not obtain a mortgage alone.

HELD: The presumption was rebutted on the basis that the primary purpose of the acquisition was as a home for the mother, even though the son also lived there and contributed to the mortgage.

There was no intention that they should be beneficial joint tenants, especially when the woman would have wanted all her sons to benefit on her death from her only significant asset. If they were joint tenants, the house would pass to the youngest son by survivorship.
