# Uzinterimpex JSC v Standard Bank plc [2008] EWCA Civ 819

## Summary

The court declined to imply a term into an advance payment guarantee, akin to a performance bond, since it was essential to the maintenance of international commerce that a document such as the guarantee should operate in accordance with the terms which appeared on its face. In principle, a duty to avoid or minimise loss arose when goods were converted in the same way as in the case of other legal wrongs.

## Abstract

The appellant (U) appealed against a decision ( _[[2007] EWHC 1151 (Comm), [2007] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 187](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I423BEB90035C11DCBFFFC23AB45AE726/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a6dee5359e24c498633c38dd2c3a87d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ ) on its claim against the respondent bank (S) arising out of a contract for the sale of cotton.

The contract provided for monthly deliveries of cotton by U to the buyer (M). U arranged an advance payment guarantee with an Uzbek bank (N) in favour of S, as security agent and trustee for a syndicate of banks, and S opened a letter of credit in favour of U. The amount of the guarantee was to be reduced automatically by the value of consignments delivered to M. Both sides experienced difficulties in performing the contract. When U failed to present documents promptly in respect of goods that were already afloat or in warehouses awaiting shipment, M took steps to obtain control of the goods without waiting to receive the documents. The result was that M had sold and delivered to its customers cotton for which U had not been paid and in respect of which the amount of the guarantee had not been reduced. S then claimed on the guarantee and received the full amount outstanding. At that time S was holding documents of title to cotton which had been presented by U for payment but which did not conform to the letter of credit. S refused to release those documents. U succeeded in an arbitration against M but M went into insolvent liquidation. U claimed against S. The judge rejected claims that it was an implied term of the guarantee that, if S made a demand that turned out to be excessive, it would repay the excess, and that S was liable to account to U as a constructive trustee of the proceeds of sales of cotton where S knew that M had obtained possession or control of the goods wrongfully. The judge held that, by refusing to release the documents, S had converted the goods to which they related and was liable in damages. However, the amount of U's claim fell to be reduced because it had failed to mitigate its loss.

U submitted that

(1) a term was to be implied into the guarantee to prevent double recovery by S;

(2) S was bound to reduce the amount payable under the guarantee by the price of goods of which M had taken delivery where conforming documents had not been presented;

(3) S was liable on the basis of knowing receipt where M had obtained delivery of cotton without taking up and paying for the documents and had remitted the proceeds of the subsale to S;

(4) it had not acted unreasonably and in breach of its duty to mitigate.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) It was not necessary to imply a term in order to give business efficacy to the guarantee. It stood as an independent contract between N and S. If a demand under the guarantee resulted in the wrongful refund of part of the price due to U, U would have a remedy against M under the contract of sale, even though in the instant case that remedy was of little value because M was insolvent. It was essential to the maintenance of international commerce that a document such as the guarantee should operate in accordance with the terms that appeared on its face. A term linking the scope of the obligation under the guarantee to the receipt of funds by S from other sources would be inconsistent with the nature of the instrument.

(2) Where M did not accept delivery of goods under the contract, but obtained delivery of them outside the contract and contrary to its terms, S was not obliged as between itself and N to treat the documents as a sufficient basis for reducing the amount of the guarantee, assuming the facts had been drawn to its attention. The terms of the guarantee were explicit: S was obliged to reduce the amount by the relevant proportion of the sale price of any goods in respect of which U presented conforming documents. In any event S was not in a position to relate the funds remitted by M to specific cargoes of cotton.

(3) Whether S received the proceeds of sale as a trustee or simply as agent for the syndicate, it received them in a capacity which gave it a sufficient interest to render it liable as a constructive trustee if it had the required degree of knowledge. However, there was no evidential basis for a finding that S received the funds with knowledge of a kind that would make its retention of them unconscionable, _[Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele [2001] Ch. 437, [2000] 6 WLUK 317](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6EBA46D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a6dee5359e24c498633c38dd2c3a87d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. An argument that the proceeds of sale were recoverable as U's property was unsound, _[Trustee of the Property of FC Jones & Sons (A Firm) v Jones [1997] Ch. 159, [1996] 4 WLUK 266](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDE8B3220E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a6dee5359e24c498633c38dd2c3a87d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.

(4) U acted unreasonably in rejecting S's proposal that the cotton should be sold and the proceeds held in a blocked account pending the outcome of the dispute. In principle, a duty to avoid or minimise loss arose when goods were converted in the same way as in the case of other legal wrongs. The [Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 s.11](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9799B731E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a6dee5359e24c498633c38dd2c3a87d&contextData=(sc.Default)) did not have any bearing on the existence of a duty to mitigate.
