# Wales v Framjee [2014] EWHC 2507 (Ch)

## Summary

The trustees of an unincorporated charity that had established a website to allow the public to make charitable donations held the donations on trust, and the remaining funds were to be distributed to the ultimate recipient on a pari passu basis.

## Abstract

The applicant Charity Commission sought declarations and directions in relation to a fund comprising donations paid by the public to an unincorporated charity (the trust).

The respondents were former or present trustees of the trust. The trust had established a website where the public made donations to the trust for the benefit of a charity of their choice. The trust found itself having to use incoming donations in a later month in order to fund the payment to recipients of donations made in an earlier month. The Commission established a statutory inquiry following various complaints, and on June 6, 2013 an interim manager, the first respondent (F), was appointed to act as the trust's receiver and manager. F's appointment was not the subject of any public announcement, and the website continued to receive donations while he investigated matters. The trust's bank accounts were closed on June 28. No payments of distributions to recipients of donations were made after June 6, but in the meantime the trust had received further donations. The issues were (i) whether the arrangement under which the website operated gave rise to a trust; (ii) whether the arrangements gave rise to a contract between the donor and the trust; (iii) how the remaining funds should be distributed.

With regard to (i) the Charity Commission submitted that every donation gave rise to a separate express trust of which the donor was the settlor, and the charity the beneficiary. With relation to the distribution of funds, F submitted that as donations received before June 6 could not have been affected by the trustees' previous procedures which allowed the shortfall to develop, it would be unfair to make the subsequent recipients suffer for the consequences of a management regime which had no effect on donations made after the cut-off date.

## Held

Judgment accordingly.

(1) The donations were subject to a trust. The trustees came under a fiduciary duty to ensure that each donation would be used only for the purpose the donor specified, those being the terms on which the donation had been solicited, _[Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12, [2002] 2 A.C. 164, [2002] 3 WLUK 573](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF41FF00E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=225ad7809acf49508f4aa65b88c9d679&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. Furthermore, the trusts on which the donations were held were separate from the general charitable objectives of the trust. The court concluded that the website was a global sub-trust the trustees had established under the aegis of the trust itself, and not as an arrangement which gave rise to literally thousands of separate trusts. That analysis made allowance for the important fact that the trust was an established charitable trust with general objectives when the website was established, and the fact that it was the trust to which donations were made. Each donor was a settlor in relation to the funds which originated from him and had to be dealt with by the trustees in way that ensured they reached their specified destination, subject only to a possible residual discretion where that could not be achieved (see paras [29, 37-38, 40](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The website constituted an offer by the trustees to enter into legal relations with potential donors, which matured into a concluded contracted when a donor made a payment to the trust, thereby accepting the offer made on the website. The terms and conditions on the website were framed in legal language and clearly evinced an intention on the part of the trust to enter into legal relations with donors. Its terms were that, in return for the donation, the trust would process it in the way explained on the website and ensure that payment would be made within a reasonable time to the nominated charity. The contract conferred a benefit on the nominated ultimate recipient and there was nothing to indicate that the parties did not intend it to be enforceable by them. It therefore fell within the [Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA0536EF1E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=225ad7809acf49508f4aa65b88c9d679&contextData=(sc.Default)) and was in principle enforceable by the ultimate recipient in accordance with provisions of the Act (paras [43, 45-46](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The website operated in precisely the same way, so far as donors were concerned, before and after June 6. There was nothing to alert donors to the fact that the Commission had appointed F, and the reasonable expectations of a donor who made a gift on June 7 would have been the same as those of a donor who made a similar gift two days previously. The fairest solution was to regard all the unpaid recipients as participants in a common misfortune brought about by the way in which the trustees managed the donation scheme. Distribution was to be made on a pari passu basis (paras [60-61, 64](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
