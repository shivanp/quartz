# Re Partington (1887) 57 LT 654

A testamentary trust had two trustees. One was a solicitor and the other was the testator’s widow. The solicitor took sole responsibility for the administration, failed to properly inform the widow and negligently made an unauthorised investment. The court awarded a full indemnity on the basis that it was reasonable for the widow to have relied on the solicitor’s advice.
