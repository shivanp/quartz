# Pennington v Waine [2002] EWCA Civ 227

 The transfer documents for the transfer of 400 shares from Ada Crampton to her nephew, Harold, remained with her own agent (the Company auditor) Mr Pennington.

Despite this, the Court of Appeal indicated that equity would perfect an imperfect gift in any situation where it would be unconscionable for the donor to resile from it, concluding that was the case here.

Ada who was a director and shareholder at the company took the following steps to make the gift to her nephew:

- She signed a stock transfer form and gave it to Mr Pennington (her agent) who put it on file.
- She told Harold she wanted him to be a director at the company (he could only do this if he held at least one share).
- She and Harold signed a form of consent for him to act as director, and he took on the benefits and burdens of directorship.
- Her agent, Mr Pennington, told Harold he need take no further action.

For the principle in Re Rose or Mascall v Mascall to apply, Ada should have done all in her power to transfer ownership to Harold. However:

- she had not given the documents to the Company Registrar;
- she had not given the documents to Harold or his agent.
- The document were with her own agent, an extension of herself, and so she could revoke her decision at any time.

So why was it unconscionable?

Arden LJ said that there could be no comprehensive list of factors that make it ‘unconscionable’ for the donor to change his mind. It was relevant that:

- Ada made the gift of her own free will
- She told Harold about the gift and signed the transfer form which she gave to Mr Pennington to secure registration
- Mr Pennington told Harold he need take no further action
- Harold agreed to be director, which he could not do without holding a share
- Ada had countersigned the form of consent for Harold’s directorship

An incompletely constituted gift of shares could be upheld if the gift had been completed to such an extent that the donee could enforce his right to the shares as against third parties without forcing the donor to take any further step. Moreover, it was not always necessary that there should have been delivery of the shares: in some circumstances, delivery could be dispensed with.

P and B, executors of the estate of C, applied for a direction and/or a declaration that in the event that they transferred any of 480 shares in CB, a company of whose 2,000 ordinary shares C had been the majority shareholder, to a transferee other than W, they would hold the proceeds of sale in substitution subject to the terms of C's will by which she had gifted the shares to W. On behalf of several residuary beneficiaries, P and B contended that pre emption clauses in CB's articles of association conferred a contractual right on the shareholders to acquire shares left to W and another legatee, HC, in the event of any attempt to transfer the shares to persons other than privileged relations. P and B argued that the testamentary gifts to W and HC would fail if the option or rights of pre emption were properly exercised, or alternatively that the [Companies Act 1948 Sch.1 reg.29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2012D5817E3111E496F7A0A22A1980EC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3474ea94affc46799ee4dc6f1d7cd961&contextData=(sc.Search)) to reg.32 meant that the pre emption rights were triggered during C's lifetime, such that either the rule in _[Lawes v Bennett 29 E.R. 1111, [1785] 2 WLUK 20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8FFF0150E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3474ea94affc46799ee4dc6f1d7cd961&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied or else the testamentary gifts were merely conditional upon W and HC having registered as members so as to entitle them to exercise control over CB's affairs.

Held, refusing the application, that the pre emption rights, which had not been created by C and had not been triggered by the time of her death would become effective only in the event of a sale of the shares by the shareholders and were distinguishable from an option or conditional contract under which a third party had the right to acquire the subject matter of a testamentary gift, Lawes v Bennett distinguished. Accordingly, since C had chosen not to sell during her lifetime, the shares were vested in her estate and the rights of pre emption did not cause the testamentary gifts to W and HC to fail. The Regulations under the [Companies Act 1948](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID11A2F10075B11E4A44CBFD6720ADB52/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3474ea94affc46799ee4dc6f1d7cd961&contextData=(sc.Search)) on the transmission of shares could not take precedence over the express clause in C's articles of association permitting C's shares to be transferred or placed in the name of the executors or trustees. The contention that the testamentary gifts were conditional on the basis that C must have intended them to take effect only if the legatees registered as members of the company, could not be sustained in the face of the will's plain and unambiguous words, which clearly created gifts that were absolute rather than conditional. No further evidence as to C's intention could be admitted pursuant to the Administration of Justice Act 1932 s.21 . Despite concerns that P and B ought not to have brought an application on behalf of those seeking an indemnity in relation to the costs of their appeal, it was not unreasonable for them as personal representatives to recover their costs from C's estate on the indemnity basis and in accordance with the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 Sch.1 RSC Ord.85 .

## Summary

Where a deceased beneficial owner of the majority share capital in a company had completed a share transfer form to transfer shares by way of gift to her nephew but the form had not been delivered to him or to the company, equity did not need to intervene to perfect the gift because it was accepted that the donor had had no intention of revoking it in the future and the donee had discharged the burden of establishing that it would be unconscionable for the donor's executors to resile from the transfer.

## Abstract

The fifth and sixth defendants appealed against a decision whereby shares in a company were held to have been transferred by the deceased beneficial owner, A, to her nephew, H, by way of gift. A had indicated to H that she wished to give him some of her shares and that she also wanted him to become a director in the company. A informed the company's auditors of her intention and a share transfer form was prepared. The form was signed by A and returned to the auditor. In spite of the auditor's assurance that H need take no further action in relation to the transfer of the shares, the change in ownership had not been registered at the time of A's death. The company's articles of association contained pre-emption provisions requiring A's shares to be offered to other members which, at the material time, would not have included H. Directors were also required to hold a qualifying share. The appellants argued that legal title passed only on registration of the share transfer by the company and that equity should not intervene where A had failed to do everything within her power to perfect the gift.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that where a transaction was purely voluntary, the principle that equity would not assist a volunteer was to be strictly applied, _[Milroy v Lord 45 E.R. 1185, [1862] 7 WLUK 110](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICAC08CE0E57211DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a94c6af2b8e44504b604a6cb776ee195&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed. However, the court was able to treat an apparently incomplete gift as completely constituted at the point where it would have become unconscionable for the donor to change his or her mind, _[T Choithram International SA v Pagarani [2001] 1 W.L.R. 1, [2000] 11 WLUK 880](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC7746611E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a94c6af2b8e44504b604a6cb776ee195&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed. Thus, the court could have properly concluded that it was too late for A to resile from her gift at the point where H signed a form giving consent to act as a director. The requirement that A deliver the form of transfer to H could be dispensed with where there was a clear finding that A intended to make an immediate gift, _[Rose (Deceased), Re [1952] Ch. 499, [1952] 4 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8F993C20E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a94c6af2b8e44504b604a6cb776ee195&contextData=(sc.Search))_ distinguished. Moreover, it was appropriate for the court to apply the principle of benevolent construction so as to give effect to A's clear wishes. Accordingly, the words employed by the auditor were to be interpreted as meaning that A and, through her, the auditors became agents for H for the purpose of submitting the share transfer to the company. H had not questioned the assurance that he was not required to take further action and must be taken to have proceeded to act on the basis that the gift would be honoured. Clarke L.J. added that where the donor's intention was clear, a transfer form, when read in conjunction with the [Stock Transfer Act 1963 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I93D04890E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a94c6af2b8e44504b604a6cb776ee195&contextData=(sc.Search)), was capable of effecting an equitable assignment without the necessity of a transfer or delivery of the form. The equitable assignment was completed when A signed the transfer form with no intention of revoking it in the future, and there was no need for equity to intervene to perfect the gift.
