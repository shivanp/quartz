# Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] AC 777

The [Married Women's Property Act 1882 s.17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1E9DB080E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c60f653564ee48a2b30cccfb97b1835d&contextData=(sc.Default)) is purely procedural; it does not confer on the court an unfettered discretion to override existing rights in property, or to apply any notion of family assets not to be found in English law in determining disputes as to title or possession after a marriage has broken down. Such issues involve questions of social policy which should be dealt with by Parliament. The legal title to H and W's former matrimonial home was in W alone. H had not paid any money towards its purchase but he had redecorated and improved the home, thus enhancing its value. Following a divorce H issued proceedings under s.17 claiming an interest in the proceeds of sale of the home.

Held, allowing W's appeal, (1) that s.17 was merely procedural, and (2) that in the absence of any agreement or estoppel to the contrary W was absolutely entitled to the home or the proceeds of its sale. ( _[Appleton v Appleton [1965] 1 W.L.R. 25, [1964] 11 WLUK 31](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5EC09DB0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c60f653564ee48a2b30cccfb97b1835d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled).
