# Lloyds Bank v Rosset [1991] 1 A.C. 107

L appealed against a decision upholding R's beneficial right to occupy property over which L had a registered charge ([1989] Ch. 350). R had carried out decorating work and supervised restoration on property purchased in the sole name of her husband (H). R was in possession on 7 November 1982 but contracts were not exchanged until 23 November and completion took place on 17 December. On 14 December H executed a charge in favour of L unbeknown to R. The charge was registered on 7 February 1983. H defaulted on the loan.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the relevant date for determining whether R was in occupation of the property for creation of an overriding interest in terms of the [Land Registration Act 1925 s.70](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39ECF620E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fbfba4325179473ea8ff1e7a9f13ec59&contextData=(sc.Search)) was the date of the creation of the charge, 17 December. L correctly challenged whether R had any beneficial interest in the property. There was no express agreement between R and H between November and 17 December that R would have a beneficial interest in the property and no express evidence of discussions to that effect. The work R did on the property was insufficient to create the inference of beneficial ownership or creation of a constructive trust. Conduct such as payment towards the purchase price by the party who was not the legal owner was required before such an inference would be drawn.
