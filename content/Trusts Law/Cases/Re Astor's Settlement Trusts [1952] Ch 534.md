# Re Astor's Settlement Trusts [1952] Ch 534

Facts: A trust of substantially all the shares in The Observer Ltd were held on trust for various non-charitable purposes including:

- The maintenance…of good understanding sympathy and co-operation between nations
- The preservation of the independence and integrity of newspapers
- The control, publication…financing or management of any newspapers, periodicals, books, pamphlets or publications
- The protection of newspapers…from being absorbed…or being tied by finance or otherwise to special…views…inconsistent with the highest integrity and independence.

Roxburgh J rejected the argument that the trustees could simply disregard those purposes which were insufficiently defined as follows:

> "The purposes must be so defined that if the trustees surrendered their discretion, the court could carry out the purposes declared, not a selection of them arrived at by eliminating those which are too uncertain to be carried out."

He also considered the purposes too inherently uncertain to be performed:

> "But how in any case could I decree in what manner the trusts applicable to income were to be performed? The settlement gives no guidance at all."

Counsel’s argument that the trustees could apply to Court for a “scheme” for the administration of the trust, as is available for charitable purpose trusts, was rejected:

> "It is not, I think, a mere coincidence, that no case has been found outside the realm of charity in which the court has yet devised a scheme of ways and means for attaining enumerated trust purposes."
>
> "[It would]…necessarily require the assistance of a custodian of the public interest analogous to the Attorney-General in charity cases, who would not only help to formulate schemes but could be charged with the duty of enforcing them and preventing maladministration. There is no such person."

On its facts the trust in Re Astor's also failed for not falling within a recognised Endacott exception, leading Roxburgh J to conclude:

> "…while I have reached my decision on two separate grounds, both, I think, have their origin in a single principle, namely, that a court of equity does not recognise as valid a trust which it cannot both enforce and control. This seems to me to be good equity and good sense."
