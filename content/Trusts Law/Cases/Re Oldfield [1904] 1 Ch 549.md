# Re Oldfield [1904] 1 Ch 549

By her will, a woman gave property to her daughters and expressed her ‘desire’ that they should make some provision for her son.

The testatrix, by her will, gave all her property equally among her two daughters ;as tenants in common for their own absolute use and benefit;, and she appointed them as her executrices. She then added in her will,

> My desire is that each of my said two daughters shall during the lifetime of my son pay to him one-third of the respective incomes of my said two daughters accruing from the moneys and investments under this my will.

The issue arose as to whether the will created an effectual trust in favour of the son during his life of a one-third share of the income of the testatrix' estate. The Court of Appeal held that no trust was created in favour of the son. The will did not impose a joint obligation upon the daughters, as would be the case if they were trustees, but each daughter was to pay the son out of her own income, so that if it was a trust it would be a separate obligation on each daughter to take her own income and pay out of it one-third to the son during his life.
