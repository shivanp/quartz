# Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Limited [1980] Ch 515

In Bartlett, the trustees had a majority shareholding in a company but failed to properly supervise it. The company made two investments in property, one of which was profitable but the other made a large loss. The trustees could offset the profit against the loss as they arose from the same breach (i.e. the failure to monitor the companyâ€™s speculative investments).

When assessing compensation to make good breaches of trust, a court will consider the depletion of the trust assets, as well as other types of lost income, but no account will be taken of the tax liability of individual beneficiaries to reduce the compensation payable. The bank was trustee of a settlement, which consisted of all the debenture stock and shares in a private company. Without the bank's knowledge, the board embarked on hazardous property speculation, and lost a great deal of money. The bank did not attend board-meetings, and the only information it had was gleaned at annual general meetings. The bank was found to be in breach of trust, and liable for the loss occasioned. In later proceedings, the question arose as to how compensation should be made so as to make good the breaches of trust.

Held, the court would first determine the extent to which the company's assets had been wrongly depleted in consequence of the breaches of trust; then the court would determine the additional proceeds of sale which would have accrued on the disposal of the respective shareholdings if the assets had not been depleted. Compensation therefor would be assessed at the date of the sale of the shareholdings, based as to each settled share on an appropriate proportion of the value of the company as a whole, not treating the settled shares as separate and independent shareholdings to be valued as minority interests. The assessment would not take into account the tax liability of individual beneficiaries to reduce the compensation payable.
