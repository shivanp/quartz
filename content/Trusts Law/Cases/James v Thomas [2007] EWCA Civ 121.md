# James v Thomas [2007] EWCA Civ 121

## Summary

On the evidence taken as a whole, the judge had been entitled to hold that the seller of a car was acting as an agent for the owner of a car park and that the buyer had knowledge that the seller was acting as an agent.

## Abstract

The appellant (C) appealed against the dismissal of his claim for damages and breach of contract against the respondent (K).

A car owner (L) had lent his car to a friend whilst he had gone abroad. The car was parked in a residential car park and left for a period of time. The owner of the car park was of the opinion that the car had incurred parking fees as there was no authorisation to park. The car park owner was authorised to sell cars to recover unpaid fees and asked that K remove the vehicle. K removed the vehicle and restored it, eventually selling it to C. When L returned to the United Kingdom he issued proceedings for the return of his car. The judge ordered that the car be returned to L as C had not acquired title. C issued Part 20 proceedings against K claiming that K had sold the vehicle and broken the implied warranty of title and expressly represented that he had acquired title from the car park owner. The judge held that K was not liable for any implied warranty of sale as he had been acting as agent for the car park owner when he sold the vehicle and C knew he was acting as an agent.

C contended that the judge was wrong to hold that K was acting as an agent and that he knew that K was acting as agent.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

Whilst it was unfortunate that the judge did not give fuller reasons for his decision, on the evidence he was entitled to reach the conclusion that K was acting as an agent. Further, on the basis of the evidence taken as a whole it was reasonable for the judge to infer that C knew that K was selling the car on behalf of the car park owner and was not the actual owner of the vehicle.
