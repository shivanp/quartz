# Curran v Collins [2015] EWCA Civ 404

## Summary

An appeal against the dismissal of a claim by a cohabitee for a share of three properties held by her former partner in his sole name, and a share in a business conducted from one of the properties, was unsuccessful where the failure at trial turned upon the judge's view of the facts and interpretation of events which could not be criticised.

## Abstract

The appellant (P) appealed against an order dismissing her claim for a share in three properties acquired by the respondent (B) and held in his name, and a kennels business conducted from the kennels attached to one of the properties.

P and B met in around 1977 to 1978 and were in a relationship from that time until 2010. P did not move in to live with B until 2002. The properties were purchased during that time. It was common ground that, because all the properties were held in B's name, P bore the legal burden of proving that she was entitled to a share; there was no express agreement. P's case at trial was that she had made significant financial contributions by using her wages from which payments of household bills, including mortgage repayments, were made. The judge was not persuaded that P had made any contribution from her earnings; her earnings were too small for her to have done so. In respect of the second property, when P had raised the question of her having a share in it B had told her that it was too expensive for her name to be on the property (the excuse); it was P's case that that statement was impliedly made on the basis that B accepted that, but for the expense, she would be an owner of the house. The judge made important findings as to credibility, and concluded that she preferred B's account of events to that of P. P appealed on the basis that the judge was wrong (i) to discount her evidence and to prefer that of B; (ii) in assessing the excuse by reference to subjective factors; (iii) to focus on financial contributions; (iv) not to find that the business was a partnership; (v) to rely on incomplete disclosure of documents by B.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The failure at trial largely turned upon the judge's view of the facts. Her finding on B's credibility envisaged that she would have to exercise caution when considering his evidence; that meant that she would on some matters accept and on others reject it. That did not amount to inconsistency. There was no suggestion that her acceptance or rejection of his evidence was against the weight of the evidence so that it was not open to her. She was not for that reason wrong to accept B's evidence at times in her judgment (see paras [3, 32](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The judge's interpretation of events surrounding the excuse was an evaluation by her of all the relevant facts and circumstances. The court could only properly interfere if the judge was wrong. The parties were not living together when the excuse was given, and did not do so until many years later. Although that was not conclusive, taken with the absence of significant contribution it constituted material which supported the judge's finding. Moreover, there was no material to gainsay the judge's finding. Accordingly, the judge's interpretation of the excuse could not be set aside as a misinterpretation of events. Given that P and B were not living together and the absence of significant contribution by P, it was clear that the judge applied the objective test in her interpretation of the excuse, _[Grant v Edwards [1986] Ch. 638, [1986] 3 WLUK 264](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB371FB60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=eda2dbaae1e2407f91ab9fe095f61221&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered (paras [41-42](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The judge expressly went beyond mere financial contributions (para.[50](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) There was no partnership agreement and the judge found that there was no documentary evidence to support it. Thus, the question whether there was a partnership turned on the parties' intention. The judge made clear findings of fact and gave reasons for her decision. There was no basis on which the instant court could interfere (paras [51, 54](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(5) It was clear from the sequence of events described by B that the judge was entitled to proceed in the way she did (para.[57](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
