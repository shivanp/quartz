# Re Stewart [1908] 2 Ch 251

The donor received the proceeds of a bond presented by him to his donee wife and subsequently drawn, and he paid them into the first bank. He bought another bond in the place of the one drawn and paid for it by his cheque drawn on the second bank. The donor, by a codicil to his will, gave the balance of his account at the first bank to the donee and appointed her as executrix. The donee contended that she was entitled to the bonds, as the imperfect gift in the donor's lifetime was perfected by her appointment as executrix under the principle laid down in Strong v Bird LR 18 Eq 315. The Chancery Division held that an imperfect gift of personalty by a donor, who died shortly afterwards, would be made effectual by the appointment of the donee to be the donorâ€™s executrix, even if she was only one of several executors. Thus, the donee was entitled both to the bond and the balance at the first bank.
