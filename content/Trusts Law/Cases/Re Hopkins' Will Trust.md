# Re Hopkins' Will Trust

A gift was left on trust for the purpose of researching whether plays attributed to Shakespeare may have been authored by Francis Bacon. Wilberforce J did not find himself to be constrained by the requirement of "an element of teaching or education" and was unwilling to treat these words as meaning that the promotion of academic research could not be charitable. He held that the research must "either be of educational value to the researcher or must be so directed as to lead to something which will pass into the store of educational material, or so as to improve the sum of communicable knowledge".
