# Re Golayâ€™s Will Trusts [1965] 1 WLR 969

A gift of a reasonable income for life may be valid. A testator directed that X was "to enjoy one of my flats during her lifetime and to receive a reasonable income from my other properties." On an originating summons raising the point, held that the gift was sufficiently certain and was valid. (_Jackson v Hamilton (1846) 3 J. & Lat. 702, [1846] 1 WLUK 6_ applied).
