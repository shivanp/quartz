# Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567

#key-case

FACTS: Quistclose Investments Ltd agreed to lend money to Rolls Razor Ltd. The parties  
agreed that Rolls could only use the money to pay a dividend to its shareholders and that it  
could not be used for any other purpose. The money was paid into an account which Rolls had  
opened with Barclays Bank Ltd especially for the deposit of the money. Before it was able to  
pay the dividend, Rolls was put into liquidation and, as a result, was precluded from paying the  
dividend.  

The issue was whether Barclays could set off the sum credited to the account against Rolls’  
indebtedness to Barclays on its other accounts.  

HELD: The sum credited to the loan account was held on trust for Quistclose. Since Barclays  
had notice of the trust, it could not set off that sum against money owing on Rolls’ other  
overdrawn accounts.  

Lord Wilberforce reasoned that, since it was agreed that the money could only be used to pay the dividend, it was not part of Rolls’ general assets. As Rolls couldn’t pay the dividend, it had to return the money to Quistclose. In other words, Rolls held the money on trust for Quistclose.  

He expressly rejected the argument that the loan to Rolls excluded the possibility of a trust,  
stating that there was ‘no difficulty in recognising the co-existence in one transaction of legal and equitable rights and remedies’ and that ‘the flexible interplay of law and equity’ was  
perfectly able to facilitate such transactions.

## Case Digest

Where a lender makes a loan to a borrower specifically so that the money is to be used for a particular purpose and that purpose fails, the borrower has no beneficial interest in the money lent but holds it upon a resulting trust for the lender. If the money is in the hands of a third party who knows of the circumstances, that person holds it upon trust for the lender.

R Co, which was in serious financial difficulties, obtained a loan from Q Co upon the terms that the money lent was to be used solely to enable R Co to pay a dividend. R Co sent Q Co's cheque for the sum lent together with a covering letter revealing the purpose of the loan to R Co's bank, which placed the money in a specially opened account named “No.4 ordinary dividend share account.” At all material times R Co was heavily in debt to the bank. Before the payment of the dividend R Co went into liquidation. The bank claimed to be able to set-off the money in the No.4 account against R Co's indebtedness to it.

Plowman J. upheld the bank's claim, but the Court of Appeal reversed his decision ([1968] Ch. 540). On further appeal, held, dismissing the bank's appeal,

1. that not only was R Co under a legal contractual obligation to repay to Q Co the money lent (which was not disputed) but since the particular and only purpose of the loan had failed the money was subject to a resulting trust for Q Co; and
2. that it was plain that the bank knew of the purpose of the loan and was therefore a trustee of the money for Q Co ( _[Toovey v Milne 106 E.R. 514, [1819] 6 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I136421A0E57311DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0fce481bee5449e4aea1a47338f11503&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied and _[Edwards v Glyn 121 E.R. 12, [1859] 6 WLUK 43](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7EAC7AC0E57811DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0fce481bee5449e4aea1a47338f11503&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Rogers, Re Ex p.
