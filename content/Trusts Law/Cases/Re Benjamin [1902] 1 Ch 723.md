# Re Benjamin [1902] 1 Ch 723

In September 1892, P, who was then twenty-four years of age disappeared, and he had never since been heard of. Under his father’s will he was entitled to a share of the residuary estate in the event of his surviving the testator. The testator died in June 1893. Upon a summons taken out by the trustees in 1900 to have it determined how P’s share ought to be dealt with, the Chancery Division held that P must be presumed to be dead and, in the absence of proof that he had survived the testator, without making any declaration as to the date of P’s death, liberty would be given the trustees to distribute his share on the footing that he had predeceased the testator.
