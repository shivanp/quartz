# Choithram v Pagarani [2001] 1 WLR 1

FACTS: A businessman decided to establish a charitable trust, appointing himself as one of a number of trustees. The trust was validly established by deed.

The settlor orally declared that he held all his estate on trust for the charity but did not transfer legal title to some of his shares into the joint names of his co-trustees, meaning he remained the sole legal owner of those shares on his death.

The court therefore needed to determine whether the shares were held on trust for the charity or if they passed under his will.

HELD: The fact that the settlor had not transferred legal title to all the trustees did not prevent the shares being held on the terms of the trust. This was because he was one of those trustees and it would be ‘unconscionable’ for him to deny that the shares were subject to the trust.

To help understand the reasoning in this case, it is helpful to compare how it would have been analysed if it had been either (i) a straightforward transfer on trust to independent trustees or (ii) a self-declaration of trust:

(i) If the settlor had transferred legal title to one of a number of intended trustees, this would constitute the trust. That trustee would then be required to ensure legal title was vested in their co-trustees.  
(ii) If he had been the sole trustee, the trust would have been a straightforward self-declaration which would have been automatically constituted.

Consequently, as the settlor had legal title, the trust was automatically constituted upon declaration, putting him under a duty to vest the shares in his co-trustees.

## Summary

The court held that a gift, made to a charitable foundation, had been completed where the trust property had been vested in a trustee who, in turn, was one of a larger group of trustees, concluding that the trustee was bound by the trust and was obliged to transfer the property into the names of all the trustees.

## Abstract

TCI appealed against the decision of the Court of Appeal of the British Virgin Islands upholding a finding that the actions of P prior to his death had not been enough to amount to a completed gift to the charitable foundation which he had established and of which he was a trustee, and that the foundation had no right in equity to enforce the completion of the gift. Having signed the trust deed, P spoke from his deathbed of having given his wealth to the trust. However, whilst still alive, no share transfers had been undertaken by him. It had been found that

(1) P had made or tried to make an immediate and unconditional gift to the charitable foundation, but that such a gift had not been meant to be irrecoverable, and

(2) the gifted property had not been vested in all the trustees, as there had been an imperfect gift which, notwithstanding P's intentions, could not be enforced.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) it was apparent that P had intended to make an immediate unconditional gift to the charitable foundation. The judge had erred in his conclusion that P had meant the gift to be recoverable. The transaction had been undertaken by P's declaration that those assets he already held were thereafter vested in him as a trustee of the charitable foundation, and

(2) whilst P's words had been indicative of an outright gift, given the context in which they had been spoken there had been no breach of the principle established in _[Milroy v Lord 45 E.R. 1185, [1862] 7 WLUK 110](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICAC08CE0E57211DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c26f06c3cdb54a9fbc26a6dd09ad615f&contextData=(sc.Search))_. The sole legal basis for the charitable foundation derived from the trust declared through the foundation trust deed. Accordingly, in stating that he had given his wealth to the charitable foundation, P could only be understood to mean that he had given “to the trustees of the foundation trust deed to be held by them on the trusts of the foundation trust deed”. P, as one of the trustees, having declared his intention and subsequently given his wealth to the trust, his conscience was affected, and it would be improper and against equitable principles for him to be authorised to go back on that gift.
