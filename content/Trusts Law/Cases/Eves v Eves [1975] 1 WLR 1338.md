# Eves v Eves [1975] 1 WLR 1338

Where a man leads a woman, to whom he is not married, to believe that she is to have an interest in a house which he has purchased, and the parties maintain and use it for their joint benefit, the court will find a constructive trust in favour of the woman that the house is held partly for her benefit. P, a woman under 21, and D started living together in 1968, and in 1969 they had a child. D bought a house for them to live in, telling P that he would have had it transferred into their joint names, had she been over twenty-one. At the trial he admitted that her age was merely an excuse. The house was dilapidated and P did a great deal of heavy work improving it. They had another child, but in 1972, D married another woman. In 1973 P was compelled to leave the house with the children because of threats of violence. She applied for a share in the house.

Held, P had been led to believe that she was to have a share in the house, part of the bargain being the work she had done in improving it, and the court made a declaration that D held the house on trust as to one-quarter in her favour.
