# Re Gonin [1979] Ch 16

In _Re Gonin_ a mother intended to pass her house to her daughter but incorrectly developed the belief that she could not transfer the house to her. She therefore wrote a cheque for £33,000 in favour of her daughter in lieu of transferring the house.

The mother died without a will (intestate). The daughter was appointed as administrator of the mother’s estate and attempted to claim the house under the rule in _Strong v Bird._

It was held that _Strong v Bird_ requires a continuing intention to give, which remains unchanged until the death of the donor. By writing the cheque, the mother had changed her intention and so there was no continuing intention to give the house.

The plaintiff’s mother died intestate. It was the plaintiff’s understanding that her parents would make a gift of their house in which they lived and its contents to her. The Chancery Division held that on the assumption that the doctrine that the legal title to a gift was perfected when the intended donee had been appointed executor of and proved the intending donor’s will, what the plaintiff had to show was a continuing intention on the part of her mother that she should have the house at her mother’s death. So far as the land was concerned, no such intention could be found. The manner in which the mother had dealt with the sale of the portions of the land pointed clearly against her having any such intention. Furthermore, by drawing a cheque in the plaintiff’s favour, the mother had indicated that it was her intention that the plaintiff should inherit the cheque on her death, not that there was to be an immediate gift of land.

For an imperfect gift to be perfected under the rule in Strong , there must be evidence of a continuing intention to make the gift. P's mother died intestate, leaving P a cheque for GBP 33,000. She had intended P to have her house but believed, wrongly, that as P was born out of wedlock, she could not leave it to her. The mother had sold part of the house and some pieces of land after writing the cheque.

Held, that P could not claim under the [Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938 s.2(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2F56BCF007CA11E5B038B5D277F7EA62/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3ad56729e4b04cd4b767f4b85953eaaa&contextData=(sc.Default)) for the freehold property. There was no note or memorandum in writing nor any act of part performance exclusively referable to a contract concerning the property, _[Wakeham v MacKenzie [1968] 1 W.L.R. 1175, [1968] 2 WLUK 57](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IEF408A20E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3ad56729e4b04cd4b767f4b85953eaaa&contextData=(sc.Default))_ doubted. The rule in _[Strong v Bird (1874) L.R. 18 Eq. 315, [1874] 6 WLUK 53](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC5F54020E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3ad56729e4b04cd4b767f4b85953eaaa&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was not applicable since subsequent sales of the land by the mother denied the necessary continuing intention by her that P should have the land. No other discretionary remedy would be granted to P because of the time taken by her to pursue her claim.
