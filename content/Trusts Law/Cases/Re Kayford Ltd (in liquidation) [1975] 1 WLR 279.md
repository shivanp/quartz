# Re Kayford Ltd (in liquidation) [1975] 1 WLR 279

FACTS: Kayford Ltd was a mail order company. Its managing director, Kay, was concerned about its solvency and about customers who were paying for goods which the company might be unable to supply. He consulted an insolvency specialist, Wainwright, about these concerns.  

In relation to the customers, Wainwright advised Kay to open a separate bank account and to call it the ‘Customers’ Trust Deposit Account’ and to pay into the account any further payments received from customers. The purpose of doing this was to ensure that, if the company went into liquidation, it would be able to refund those customers’ payments. Kay accepted and implemented Wainwright’s advice. Later, the company went into voluntary liquidation.  

The issue was whether the sum credited to the separate bank account was held on trust for customers or was one of the company’s general assets.

HELD: The sum credited to the account was held on trust for customers. Megarry J made  
the following two points:  

1. A trust can be created without using the word ‘trust’. The question is whether in  
substance a sufficient intention to create a trust has been manifested.’  
2. Although the payment of money into a separate bank account is a good indicator of  
an intention to create a trust, it is neither necessary nor conclusive.  
On the facts of this case, the company intended to create a trust of the sum credited to the account because:  
> The whole purpose of what was done was to ensure that the moneys remained in the  
beneficial ownership of those who sent them, and a trust is the obvious means of  
achieving this.

## Case Digest

Advance deposits received by a mail order company and placed in a separate account are held on trust for the subscribers. Money received by a mail order company was paid into a separate company account for sums received from members of the public as cash in advance or deposits. On the liquidator's summons to determine whether such sums were part of the general assets of the company, it was held, that although there was no writing, two of the certainties required for the creation of a trust were present and the third could be established from the circumstances. The money was held on trust for those members of the public who had subscribed it. Quaere whether the same would apply to trade creditors.
