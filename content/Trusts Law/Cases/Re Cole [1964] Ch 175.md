# Re Cole [1964] Ch 175

A gift of chattels cannot be perfected by showing them to the donee and speaking words of gift. Mere words of gift are not enough to perfect a gift of chattels; the donee, in order to establish title to chattels, must prove such an act of delivery or change of possession as would be unequivocally referable to an intention by the donor to transfer possession and title in the chattels to the donee. A husband, while his family were elsewhere, bought a large house in London, furnished and equipped it at a cost of over GBP 20,000, and began to live in it. When the wife subsequently came to London, the husband took her to the house, showed her over it and said: "It's all yours." When the husband was, years later, adjudicated bankrupt, the contents of the matrimonial home were claimed by his trustee in bankruptcy. The wife moved the court for a declaration that chattels representative of the contents of the house, and now sold by her, had belonged to her immediately before they were sold, and that, accordingly, she was entitled to the proceeds of their sale. Cross, J. found that, in the circumstances, the wife had established her title to the proceeds of sale of the chattels.

Held, allowing the appeal by the trustee in bankruptcy, that as the wife had not proved anything in the circumstances surrounding the words of gift which amounted to an act of delivery or a change of possession of the chattels, either preceding, following or coincident with the words of gift so as to perfect the gift, possession and title remained in the husband. _[Irons v Smallpiece 106 E.R. 467, [1819] 5 WLUK 47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D2C91E0E57411DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4e3c27d5666c4c6d9bf6e1d5a95299e4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, _[Cochrane v Moore (1890) 25 Q.B.D. 57, [1890] 4 WLUK 41](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I891DA5D1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4e3c27d5666c4c6d9bf6e1d5a95299e4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, _Bashall v Bashall (1894) 11 T.L.R. 152, [1894] 1 WLUK 31_ applied and _[Hislop v Hislop [1950] W.N. 124, [1950] 2 WLUK 53](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I65DC3C30E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4e3c27d5666c4c6d9bf6e1d5a95299e4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Kilpin v Ratley [1892] 1 Q.B. 582, [1892] 2 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID40E5EE0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4e3c27d5666c4c6d9bf6e1d5a95299e4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished, _[Ramsay v Margrett [1894] 2 Q.B. 18, [1894] 3 WLUK 54](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I842BAAD0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4e3c27d5666c4c6d9bf6e1d5a95299e4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished, _[Magnus Ex p.
