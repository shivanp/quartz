# Boscawen v Bajwa [1996] 1 WLR 328

B's judgment creditors appealed against judgment which declared that the Abbey National (AN) had a priority charge on B's property. HBS had a charge over B's property. AN had financed the proposed purchase of B's house. The sale was not completed and the contract for sale was deemed unenforceable for reasons of non compliance with the [Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FF3C350E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e21a0715c10a4707b5716a62a80c676b&contextData=(sc.Default)), so AN had no legal title and the property remained registered with B at all times. The money belonging to AN had been transferred to and held in B's solicitor's client account as trust money to the purchaser solicitor's order, but was less than the entire purchase price. Precipitous action by B's solicitors caused it to be applied in breach of trust in the partial discharge of HBS' legal charge without obtaining the completion of the sale and the execution of a new mortgage in favour of AN.

The creditors argued that

(1) the tracing claim should have failed because AN could not establish how much of their money was used to discharge HBS's charge and how much was B's own money;

(2) if it was traceable to HBS as B was an innocent volunteer who mixed the money unknowingly, equity could follow the money and fix it with a charge in favour of B;

(3) the judge wrongly applied the subrogation doctrine in the absence of a tracing remedy;

(4) subrogation was a personal remedy;

(5) subrogation did not apply because there was no intention to that effect by the parties;

(6) it was wrong of the judge to allow AN to adopt or ratify the payment later as it was too late at that stage, and

(7) if AN succeeded on all the other points their interest should be pari passu with that of B (and therefore his creditors) as HBS's charge was redeemed in part by B's money.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) the solicitors' ledger cards were evidence of their belief in the appropriation although not primary evidence as they were made up after the event;

(2) B was not an innocent volunteer and the principle did not apply;

(3) the judge properly employed the tracing doctrine as a process not as a claim or a remedy. He was right to employ tracing in order to prove what happened to the money. This was necessary for AN to prove a retained beneficial interest. Subrogation had been correctly invoked as a remedy to reverse unjust enrichment not as a substitute for inadequate tracing. It was not a cause of action, _[Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd [1978] A.C. 95, [1977] 7 WLUK 35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I144FCD90E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e21a0715c10a4707b5716a62a80c676b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed;

(4) subrogation was capable of being a proprietary remedy and was not limited to personal remedy;

(5) subrogation was available in a wide variety of circumstances and sometimes it applied even though it was impossible to infer a mutual intention to the effect on the part of the creditor and the person claiming to be subrogated to the creditor's security. The intention of B's solicitors was what mattered in the instant case. They intended to keep HBS's charge alive for the benefit of AN pending completion. Subrogation of AN's interest to that of HBS's charge would do no more than restore the parties as nearly as might be to their original positions;

(6) the right to follow an asset, whether at common law or in equity, did not depend on adoption or ratification. There was no justification for the proposition that AN's right to be subrogated to HBS's charge did not arise until AN elected to seek that remedy, and

(7) B's payments discharged HBS's charge in equity and law. They ranked for the benefit of his equity of redemption behind the subrogated charge as they ranked behind HBS's charge.
