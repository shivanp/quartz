# Sledmore v Dalby (1996) 72 P&CR 196

FACTS: A and B (the claimant) were a married couple. They had an adult daughter, C, who was married to D (the defendant). A and B allowed C and D to live in a cottage which was owned by them. In 1976, A and B assured C and D that they would give them the cottage. In reliance on this assurance, D made various structural and decorative improvements to the cottage.

The sum spent by D on the improvements was less than £1,000, but it was substantial in relation to the value of the cottage at the time. A died in 1980 and C died in 1983. D continued to live in the cottage rent-free after C’s death. In 1991, B asked D to vacate the cottage, but D refused to do so. B initiated proceedings to recover possession of the cottage. D defended the proceedings, arguing that he had acquired an equity by way of proprietary estoppel.

HELD: Although A and B had made an assurance to D, and D had relied on that assurance to his detriment, it was not unconscionable for B to dishonour the assurance and recover possession of the cottage.

The Court of Appeal supported its conclusion by reference to the following factors:

- D had enjoyed the benefit of rent-free accommodation for more than 15 years.
- D had enjoyed the benefit of his expenditure on the cottage (by living there for many years).
- D was making minimal use of the cottage. He lived with his new partner. He only slept at the cottage – at most once or twice a week – when it was convenient to do so for the purposes of his employment.
- D was employed and was able to pay for his own accommodation.
- B was impecunious and was in receipt of state benefits.
- B had only sought to recover possession of the cottage from D because she was desperate. Her own home was at risk of being repossessed and sold by a secured creditor.

The appellant owned a house occupied by her daughter and the respondent. The appellant and her husband communicated to their daughter and the respondent their intention to give the house to them. Under the appellant’s will, she made a gift of the house to her daughter. The daughter died. The respondent was employed and lived in the house rent free. The appellant fell into financial difficulties. She unsuccessfully claimed possession of the house. On appeal, she sought to rely on proprietary estoppel. The Court of Appeal, allowing the appeal, held that the respondent assumed that he would be allowed to stay in the house for the rest of his life rent free. However, the appellant’s position and her needs had to be balanced against the respondent’ present use and needs of the premises. Accordingly, as the respondent was employed and capable of paying his own accommodation, it was no longer inequitable to allow the expectation created in his mind to be defeated.
