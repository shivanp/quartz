# Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53

FACTS: Ms Jones and Mr Kernott purchased a property in joint names. The deposit was paid from the sale of Ms Jones’ previous home in her sole name with the balanced raised by a mortgage in their joint name. From 1985-1993 they jointly contributed to household expenses and took out a joint loan to build an extension (with Mr Kernott doing some work on the extension).

The couple separated in 1993 and cashed in a joint life assurance policy which they divided equally. Mr Kernott used his 50% share to buy a new home in 1996 and Ms Jones used her share to pay the mortgage on the property, which she lived in for fourteen and a half years, paying all expenses herself. Mr Kernott made no further contributions towards the mortgage or expenses on the home (or the couple’s two children) during this period and was able to purchase his property because of this.

The majority (Lady Hale and Lords Walker and Collins) were willing to infer that the couple had intended Mr Kernott’s interest to crystallise when he moved out. This was because it was at this point that Mr Kernott stopped contributing to the mortgage and the parties divided the life assurance policy equally between them.

After this, they no longer intended to share the property equally. He no longer contributed to their shared house (or even to the maintenance of their children). The fact that he was no longer contributing (along with his share of the proceeds of the insurance policy) enabled him to fund the purchase his own property.

The majority reasoned that Mr Kernott would have the sole benefit of any capital gain on his own property, leaving Miss Jones to receive the sole benefit of any such gain on their previously shared home.

Given the increase in value of the property since the relationship broke down, along with her sole contributions to the mortgage since his departure 14 years previously, she received 90% of the house and he received a 10% share.

Jones v Kernott provides good insight into the considerations relevant to quantification. However, there were disagreements within the Supreme Court as to the role of imputation.

Lady Hale and Lord Walker stressed that, even at this stage, the primary aim should be to infer the intention of the parties based on the whole course of conduct and Lady Hale’s non-exhaustive list of factors.

However, they accepted that as a ‘fallback’ position, the court may be required to impute an intention to the parties based on “what their intentions as reasonable and just people would have been had they thought about it at the time”.

The minority disagreed that imputation was permissible at all while Lord Collins was not concerned with the conceptual difference between inference and imputation.

## Summary

In line with the decision in _[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432, [2007] 4 WLUK 407](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I20AB2C10F4AD11DB93178FA5B02D29F5/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bd7215cba5794ecab28571d4e8d8ec67&contextData=(sc.Default))_, where a property was bought in the joint names of a cohabiting couple, who were both responsible for any mortgage, but without any express declaration of their beneficial interests, the presumption that the beneficial interests coincided with the legal estate could be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intention. Where that evidence did not show what shares were intended, it was for the court to decide what shares were either intended or fair.

## Abstract

The appellant (J) appealed against a decision (_[[2010] EWCA Civ 578](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5EE7D030691E11DFB788D41C7697B40F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bd7215cba5794ecab28571d4e8d8ec67&contextData=(sc.Default))_) declaring that the property co-owned by her and the respondent (K) was held by them as tenants in common in equal shares.

The parties bought the property in joint names in 1985, with the benefit of a mortgage in their joint names. They lived there together, sharing the household expenses, for over eight years, and K moved out of the property in 1993. Thereafter, J remained in the property with their two children, and paid all the household expenses herself. K made no further contribution towards the acquisition of the property. That situation continued for over 14 years, when the property was put up for sale. K commenced proceedings in the county court claiming a declaration under the [Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 s.14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I226821D0E44F11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bd7215cba5794ecab28571d4e8d8ec67&contextData=(sc.Default)). A declaration was made that the beneficial interest was split 90 per cent to 10 per cent in favour of J, and that decision was upheld on appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed K's appeal.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

In line with the decision in _[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432, [2007] 4 WLUK 407](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I20AB2C10F4AD11DB93178FA5B02D29F5/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bd7215cba5794ecab28571d4e8d8ec67&contextData=(sc.Default))_, where a property was purchased in the joint names of a married or unmarried couple for joint occupation, who were both responsible for any mortgage, and where there was no express declaration of their beneficial interests, there was a presumption that the beneficial interests coincided with the legal estate. That presumption could be rebutted by evidence of a contrary intention, which might more readily be shown where the parties had contributed to the acquisition of the property in unequal shares, but each case would turn on its own facts. It was for the court to ascertain the parties' common intention as to what their shares in the property would be, in the light of their whole course of conduct in relation to it, _[Gissing v Gissing [1971] A.C. 886, [1970] 7 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAF292E20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bd7215cba5794ecab28571d4e8d8ec67&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546, [2005] Fam. 211, [2004] 5 WLUK 99](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I15C110D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bd7215cba5794ecab28571d4e8d8ec67&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, Stack followed (see paras [10-15, 25, 51](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment). Any challenge to the presumption was not to be lightly embarked on, since a decision to buy a property in joint names indicated an emotional and economic commitment to a joint enterprise, and the notion that in a trusting personal relationship the parties did not hold each other to account financially, was underpinned by the practical difficulty of taking any such account after years of living together (paras [19-22](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). The search was primarily to ascertain the parties' actual shared intentions, whether expressed or to be inferred from their conduct. However, where it was clear that the beneficial interests were to be shared, but it was impossible to divine a common intention as to the proportions in which they were to be shared, it was for the court to impute an intention to the parties which they might never have had. The court could not impose a solution on them which was contrary to what the evidence showed that they actually intended (paras [31, 46-47](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). Where a family home was put into the name of one party only, the starting point was different, and the first issue was whether it was intended that the other party should have any beneficial interest at all: there was no presumption of joint beneficial ownership, but their common intention had again to be deduced from their conduct (para.[52](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). In the instant case there was no need to impute an intention that the parties' beneficial interests would change, as the judge had made a finding that their intention did in fact change, and that was an intention which he both could have and should have inferred from their conduct. The calculation of their shares by the instant court produced a result so close to that produced by the judge that it would be wrong for the instant court to interfere (paras [48-49](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
