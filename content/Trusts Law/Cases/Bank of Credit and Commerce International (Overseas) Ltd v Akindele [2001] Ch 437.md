# Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele [2001] Ch 437

#key-case

FACTS: The claimant company (by its directors) made an agreement with the defendant. It agreed that if the defendant invested US$10m with the company for a period of at least two years, the company would guarantee a return of (in effect) more than 50% (a return which the trial judge described as ‘wholly exceptional’).

The transaction was artificially structured as a sale of shares to the defendant, coupled with an agreement by the company to re-purchase the shares after two years. The claimant paid $10m to the company. Two years later, he called in the investment and the company paid him $ 16.179 m.

The conduct of the company’s directors, in making the agreement and procuring the payment to the defendant, was a dishonest breach of their fiduciary duties and a misapplication of the company’s funds. But the defendant did not have any knowledge of these matters.

The company subsequently went into liquidation. It brought a claim against the defendant for knowing receipt. The principal issue was the type of knowledge required for a knowing receipt claim, and whether the defendant had that knowledge.

HELD: The defendant did not have knowledge of circumstances which rendered his receipt unconscionable, and he was not liable to the company in knowing receipt.

Nourse LJ reviewed the authorities and concluded that: dishonesty is not a requirement for a knowing receipt claim, and

> ‘[t]he recipient’s state of knowledge must be such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt.’

He held that the defendant did not have the requisite knowledge on the date of the agreement. The transaction was structured in an entirely artificial way. But there was no reason for the defendant to question the form of the transaction. The company was part of a reputable banking group and (at the time) no one doubted the integrity of the group or its management.

Nor did the defendant have the requisite knowledge on the date of the payment. By then, he was aware of rumours of financial irregularities within the group and that some directors had been arrested for money laundering. He also knew that many banks refused to transact with the group.

Nevertheless, it

> ‘was not a sufficient reason for questioning the propriety of a particular transaction entered into more than two years earlier, at a time when no one outside [the group] had reason to doubt the integrity of its management […] the defendant was entitled to take steps to protect his own interest’

and there was nothing unconscionable in his seeking to do so.

## Summary

The liquidators of BCCI appealed against the dismissal of their claim against A, a Nigerian businessman, for knowing assistance and knowing receipt, contending that the judge had erred in failing to make a finding of dishonesty. The court held that dishonesty was not a prerequisite to liability for knowing receipt, and that liability would be established if it could be shown that the individual recipient's state of knowledge was such that it would be unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt. It was not unconscionable for A to retain the benefit of the monies in question since he had only become aware of irregularities in BCCI over two years after the relevant transaction had been entered into.

## Abstract

The liquidators of B appealed against a decision ([1999] B.C.C. 669) refusing the recovery of USD 6.79 million from A, a Nigerian businessman, on the ground that proof of A's dishonesty, which was required to find him liable as a constructive trustee under both heads of knowing assistance and knowing receipt, had not been established. In 1985, A had given ICIC, a company controlled by B, a sum of USD 10 million. The sum was advanced under an artificial loan agreement designed to give the impression that certain dummy loans were performing as normal. In 1988, A received USD 16.79 million, under the agreement, as divestiture payments. The claimants argued that A's dishonesty could be inferred from his knowledge of the artificially arranged loan transaction and from his receipt of an unusually high rate of return of 15 per cent compound interest.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that A's state of knowledge of the situation in 1985 was not such as to make it unconscionable for him to enter into the transaction. Furthermore, it was not unconscionable for A to retain the benefits of the divestiture payments, notwithstanding the rumours which were circulating about the integrity of B's management. There was nothing to alert A to the fact that the particular transaction, entered into some years earlier, might be tainted. Nevertheless, the court below had erred by not distinguishing between dishonesty and knowledge in knowing receipt cases. Dishonesty was not a necessary ingredient for the establishment of liability under the knowing receipt head of constructive trust, _[Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd [1980] 1 All E.R. 393, [1979] 7 WLUK 275](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I37DBF5A0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=934c58e1b6804860a2818c1bc1c12418&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The categorisation of degrees of knowledge, accepted in, _[Baden v Societe Generale pour Favoriser le Developpement du Commerce et de l'Industrie en France SA [1993] 1 W.L.R. 509, [1983] 4 WLUK 133](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6D7A4CC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=934c58e1b6804860a2818c1bc1c12418&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , was not particularly helpful in cases of knowing receipt. In such cases a single test, asking whether it would be unconscionable for the recipient to retain the benefits of the receipt, was sufficient, and in the instant case the evidence satisfied the test. Baden considered.
