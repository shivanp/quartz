# Re Cloreâ€™s Settlement Trusts [1966] 1 WLR 955

A power to apply trust property for the benefit of a beneficiary must be exercised to improve his material situation, but this includes enabling him to discharge more cheaply moral obligations which he recognises as binding upon him, including a moral obligation to make charitable donations. On an originating summons by trustees asking whether they could apply one-seventh of the share of a beneficiary by paying it to the trustees of a foundation set up by the settlor for charitable purposes, in order to relieve the beneficiary of a moral obligation which he recognised to make donations to charity, and to enable such donations to be made on his behalf with a minimum of tax, held that this was within the power. (Dicta of Viscount Radcliffe in _[Pilkington v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1964] A.C. 612, [1962] 10 WLUK 19](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I22BE42D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7e4e240da9f74111a87d179655026216&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; dicta of Farwell, J. in _[Walker (Sir James), Re [1901] 1 Ch. 879, [1901] 2 WLUK 20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IEF8B27B0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7e4e240da9f74111a87d179655026216&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
