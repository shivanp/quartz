# Re Oatway [1903] 2 Ch 356

A trustee paid trust money into his banking account where it was mixed with his own money. He purchased his own investment out of the money in his account and applied the balance to his own purpose. The Chancery Division held that the trustee's representatives could not successfully maintain that the investment was purchased out of the trustee's own money. Further, it could not be asserted that what was spent could no longer be traced and recovered as the money belonging to the trust. Accordingly, the money and its proceeds would be returned to the trust.
