# Thomson v Humphrey [2009] EWHC 3576

## Summary

On the evidence, the claimant was unable to establish that she was entitled to a beneficial interest in a property owned by her former partner where she and her children had lived, or that she was entitled to the proceeds of sale of a previous home.

## Abstract

The claimant (T) claimed that she was entitled to the beneficial interest in a property owned by the defendant (H).

T and H had commenced a relationship. T had two children from a previous relationship. Subsequently, H purchased a house, using his own money, for T and her children to live in. The house was held in H's sole name. H subsequently sold that property and purchased a farm. T and her children moved into it. Following the breakdown of their relationship, T claimed that she was beneficially entitled to 50 per cent of the farm or, alternatively, to the proceeds of sale from the house. She gave evidence that, among other things, she had given up her job as her relationship with H developed and had been the project manager in respect of major alterations and improvements that had taken place at the farm.

## Held

Judgment for defendant.

The first question was whether there was a common intention that T should have any interest at all in the house. The evidence came nowhere near to establishing an express agreement that she should have such an interest. The furthest it was possible to go on the evidence was to say that it was the common intention that H would provide a home for her and her children. If it was necessary to rely on a constructive trust arising from something other than an agreement, the evidence again came nowhere near to establishing such an interest. Although it was not possible to lay down a clear line between what was and was not sufficient, the matters relied on by T could not give rise to an intention that she should have an interest in the house. As to the farm, the evidence was wholly insufficient to establish an express agreement that T should have a share in it. H's attitude had been shown by an attempt that he had made to get T to sign an agreement that she would have no interest in the property. In the absence of express agreement, the evidence again came nowhere near the line, wherever it might be placed, between what was and was not sufficient to give rise to an inference of a common intention that T should have a share in the property. The case was clearly the wrong side of the line from T's perspective, but whether taken separately or cumulatively, the matters on which she relied, which included leaving her job, project management, housekeeping and looking after H's mother, were simply not enough. Not only were they not referable to the activities that could be properly taken by themselves to indicate a share, but they were simply not of the type and category that were capable of giving rise to a finding that there was an intention that she should have a share in the property.
