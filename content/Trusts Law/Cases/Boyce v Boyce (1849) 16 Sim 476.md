# Boyce v Boyce (1849) 16 Sim 476

The testator devised all his houses in South-wold to the trustees in trust for his wife for life, and after her death, in trust to convey one of them, whichever she might think proper to choose, to his first daughter and her heirs, and to convey all the other of them, to his second daughter in fee. The first daughter died in the testator's lifetime without having chosen any one of the houses. The second daughter survived the testator. The testator's heir filed a bill to have all the houses conveyed to him. A general demurrer to the bill was filed. The English Court held that the demurrer was to be overruled.
