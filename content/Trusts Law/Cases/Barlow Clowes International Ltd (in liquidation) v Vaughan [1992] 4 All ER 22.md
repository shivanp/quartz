# Barlow Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) v Vaughan [1992] 4 All ER 22

The first in, first out rule for distribution of a mixed fund will not be applied if it would be impractical or result in injustice or be contrary to the intention of the investors and a preferable alternative method of distribution is available. The companies which went into liquidation had managed investment plans, but the funds had been misapplied and the investors' claims far exceeded the amount available for distribution. The receivers sought directions as to distribution. The judge held that the first in, first out rule should apply so that later investors would recover first. The earlier investors appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the first in, first out rule that withdrawals from a blended account were to be treated as withdrawing the money in the same order as it was deposited provided a convenient method of determining competing claims;

(2) where the application of the rule would be impractical or unjust because a small number of investors would get most of the funds or the result would be contrary to the investors' intention, the rule would not apply if a preferable alternative method of distribution were available;

(3) in this case investors had intended to participate in a collective investment scheme through a mixed fund and presumably intended that assets available for distribution would be shared pari passu rateably in proportion to the amounts due to them (_[Sinclair v Brougham [1914] A.C. 398, [1914] 2 WLUK 42](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA8D447C1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=624b83ebc9ce4e2faffcac1f7aa29059&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Ministry of Health v Simpson [1948] Ch. 465, [1948] 7 WLUK 33](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFB6AD130E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=624b83ebc9ce4e2faffcac1f7aa29059&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed; _[British Red Cross Balkan Fund, Re [1914] 2 Ch. 419, [1914] 7 WLUK 62](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B75DBF1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=624b83ebc9ce4e2faffcac1f7aa29059&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _Hobourn Aero Components Ltd's Trusts , Re [1945] 2 All E.R. 711, [1945] 1 WLUK 1_ applied; _[Clayton's Case [1814-23] All E.R.
