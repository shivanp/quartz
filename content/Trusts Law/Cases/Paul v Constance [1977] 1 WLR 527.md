# Paul v Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527

ACTS: Dennis Constance and Doreen Paul started cohabiting in 1967. In 1973, Dennis  
received a cheque for £950. When he received the cheque, he said to Doreen: ‘The money  
is as much yours as mine.’ They agreed to pay the cheque into a bank account. Dennis  
opened an account in his name and paid the cheque into it. The bank manager advised  
Dennis to open the account in his name on the basis that a joint account was inappropriate  
because Dennis and Doreen were not married. Dennis made enquiries of the manager to  
ensure that Doreen was able to draw on the account.

On various occasions in the following year, Dennis repeated his statement to Doreen that  
the sum credited to the account was as much hers as his. Dennis and Doreen paid  
additional sums into the account which they had won playing bingo. (They played bingo as a  
joint venture and regarded any winnings as theirs jointly.) The sums withdrawn from the  
account were applied for Dennis and Doreen’s joint benefit. Dennis died intestate in 1974.  
The issue was whether Dennis had declared a trust of the sum credited to the account, or  
whether Dennis’s estranged wife was entitled to it as his statutory next of kin.  

HELD: Dennis had declared a trust of the sum credited to the account for Doreen and  
himself, and Doreen was entitled to half that sum as the beneficiary of the trust.  
Scarman LJ noted that Dennis was a simple, unsophisticated man and that in ascertaining  
his intention, the court ‘should consider the various things that were said and done by  
[Doreen] and [Dennis] during their time together against their own background and in their  
own circumstances.’

He conceded that it was a ‘borderline’ case and that it was ‘not easy to pinpoint a specific  
moment of declaration.’ Nevertheless, he concluded that Dennis’s repeated use of the words  
‘This money is as much yours as mine’ evidenced an intention to create a trust of the sum  
credited to the account for himself and Doreen.

And he considered that this conclusion was supported by the various background features,  
especially Dennis’s conversation with the bank manager and the treatment of the bingo  
winnings and withdrawals from the account.

## Summary

To establish that an express trust has been created, there must be clear evidence from what is said or done of an intention to create a trust.

## Abstract

The deceased and his wife, the defendant, separated in 1965. In 1967 the deceased met and commenced to live with the plaintiff as man and wife, such co-habitation continuing until the death of the deceased in 1974, he dying intestate. In early 1973 the deceased received £950 in compensation for certain injuries and after discussion with the plaintiff and a visit by both to the bank manager, the deceased deposited the same in a bank account in his name alone; upon the evidence it was apparent that the opening of the account in only the deceased's name came about after it was disclosed to the bank manager that the deceased and the plaintiff were not married.

The plaintiff had the deceased's authority to draw upon the account. The deceased and the plaintiff subsequently paid into the account their winnings from their joint ventures at bingo; the one withdrawal made was on the evidence shared by them and/or used for their joint benefit. After the deceased's death, the plaintiff claimed that the contents of the bank account were the subject of an express trust for the benefit of herself and the deceased. The defendant contended that such contents were exclusively part of the deceased's estate, the plaintiff was awarded a half-share of the fund at the time of the deceased's death.

Held, dismissing the defendant's appeal, that there was clear evidence justifying the judge in concluding that the deceased intended to create an express trust (_[Jones v Lock (1865-66) L.R. 1 Ch. App. 25, [1865] 11 WLUK 142](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID09E6571E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f6bbcbb768ae44348f0233149b6a939d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Richards v Delbridge (1874) L.R. 18 Eq. 11, [1874] 4 WLUK 4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I87C52540E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f6bbcbb768ae44348f0233149b6a939d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
