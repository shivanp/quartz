# Wilson v Turner (1883) 22 Ch. D. 521

By a marriage settlement, certain personal property was settled upon trust for the wife for life, and for the children after her death. It was also declared that the trustees should, after the death of the wife, apply the whole or such part as the trustees should think fit of the annual income of the expectant share of any child for or towards the maintenance of such child. After the wife's death, the trustees paid the whole income of the trust fund to the husband during the infancy of the child of the marriage without exercising any discretion as to its application to his maintenance. The Court of Appeal held that there was no absolute trust to apply the income to the maintenance of the children, but a discretionary trust equivalent to a power. As the trustees did not exercise any discretion, the husband's estate should be held liable to repay the whole amount of the income received.
