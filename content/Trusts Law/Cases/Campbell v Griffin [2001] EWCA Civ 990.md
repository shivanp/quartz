# Campbell v Griffin [2001] EWCA Civ 990

## Summary

A lodger who had acted to his detriment by caring for his elderly landlord and landlady for a lengthy period of time was granted a charge over the property, as it was not necessary to establish a quantifiable financial detriment in order to prove proprietary estoppel.

## Abstract

C appealed against an order granting possession of a house to G, the executors of the property. C had been a lodger in the house for over 20 years. For a number of those years he had taken increasingly greater care of the elderly couple he was lodging with as they became more and more infirm. He had developed a close relationship with the couple and they had assured him that he would have a home for life. The husband executed a codicil to his will leaving C a life interest in the house, however, as the house was held by the couple as a joint tenancy, and the wife had lost her testamentary capacity by that stage and had not added a corresponding codicil to her will, the gift failed by survivorship. C had made his claim based on the doctrine of proprietary estoppel and the judge had found that although assurances about C's life interest in the house had been given, C had not relied on them to his detriment because he had taken care of the couple out of friendship and a sense of responsibility.

Held, allowing the appeal, that C had acted to his detriment in taking care of the couple and he should accordingly be given a charge over the property. He had been doing much more than would have been ascribed to even the most friendly lodger and a live in carer would have expected payment for undertaking such duties. It was highly probable that his conduct had been influenced by the assurances given by the couple, _[Wayling v Jones [1995] 2 F.L.R. 1029, [1993] 7 WLUK 242](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF11D8780E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13e14b4f061040d582b038f1194563ff&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. A broad enquiry into all the circumstances was necessary as opposed to a mere assessment of any financial loss incurred, _[Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch. 210, [2000] 3 WLUK 214](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAEF3ED50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13e14b4f061040d582b038f1194563ff&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
