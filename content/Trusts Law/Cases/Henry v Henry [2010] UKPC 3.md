# Henry v Henry [2010] UKPC 3

## Summary

The Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court had adopted an erroneous approach to the issue of detriment in considering a proprietary estoppel claim. It had failed to weigh any disadvantages suffered by the claimant by reason of his reliance on the promise against any countervailing advantages which he had enjoyed by reason of that reliance.

## Abstract

The appellant (T) appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court that an equity had arisen in favour of the respondent (C) in respect of a plot of agricultural land, and that the equity should be satisfied by awarding the plot of land to C.

T had bought the land from an elderly relative (G) shortly before G died. C had been living on and cultivating the land for more than 30 years. It was his case that G had promised to leave the land to him upon her death, and that, by working on the land and taking care of G until she died, he had relied on that promise to his detriment. The judge dismissed C's proprietary estoppel claim, finding that he had not suffered a detriment, rather he had positively benefited from residing on the land and reaping its produce. The judge also found that there were no grounds for disturbing T's title to the land, given that she was a purchaser for value, she had been the registered proprietor since 1999 and she had made no promises to C. The Court of Appeal held that C had suffered a detriment, and that accordingly an equity had arisen in his favour in respect of the land; furthermore, the equity was binding on T since it was an "overriding interest" within the meaning of the Land Registration Act 1984 (Saint Lucia) s.28.

T argued that (1) there were no grounds justifying the Court of Appeal's interference with the judge's conclusion that there was no detriment. Relying upon _[Steria Ltd v Hutchison [2006] EWCA Civ 1551, [2007] I.C.R. 445, [2006] 11 WLUK 586](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70E219807E9E11DBB78988C8CDE62CEF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=23fe6e28dac5493c8ef452f17fc517be&contextData=(sc.Default))_, she submitted that the concepts of reliance and detriment fell to be considered separately; (2) although any equity enjoyed by C would constitute an "overriding interest" within the meaning of s.28 of the Act, the test of unconscionability had to be considered afresh in relation to her position as purchaser of the land. There was nothing unconscionable about the circumstances in which she purchased the land, so she should take the land free of any equity which might be found to have arisen in C's favour as against G; (3) any equity which had arisen had been fully satisfied by the countervailing benefits which C had received over the years. Entitlement to the plot of land was on any basis disproportionate to the detriment which C might have suffered.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) Even though the concepts of reliance and detriment could be regarded, in the abstract, as different, in applying the principles of proprietary estoppel they were often intertwined, _[Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch. 210, [2000] 3 WLUK 214](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAEF3ED50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=23fe6e28dac5493c8ef452f17fc517be&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, Steria cited. The two concepts were intertwined in the instant case. The judge had misdirected himself on the issue of detriment by failing to weigh the disadvantages suffered by C against the countervailing advantages which he enjoyed as a result of G's promises, _[Jennings v Rice [2002] EWCA Civ 159, [2003] 1 F.C.R. 501, [2002] 2 WLUK 603](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICD00CC50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=23fe6e28dac5493c8ef452f17fc517be&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Campbell v Griffin [2001] EWCA Civ 990, [2001] W.T.L.R. 981, [2001] 6 WLUK 562](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I813FCAF1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=23fe6e28dac5493c8ef452f17fc517be&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The Court of Appeal had also approached the issue of detriment erroneously, as demonstrated by its finding that the judge had erred in attempting to compare the advantage with the detriment. Therefore, the question of detriment had to be considered afresh. It was clear from the evidence that, by remaining on the land, C had deprived himself of the opportunity of a better life elsewhere. That detriment had not been outweighed by the advantages C enjoyed as a result of remaining on the land. Accordingly, an equity had arisen in C's favour under the doctrine of proprietary estoppel in respect of the land.

(2) It was possible that cases might arise in which the circumstances surrounding a third party purchase might, notwithstanding the claimant's overriding interest, require the court to reassess the extent of the claimant's equity in the property. However, T's case contained no plea to that effect, nor was any such case pursued on her behalf at trial, so the issue did not arise.

(3) In determining the extent of the equity in C's favour, the Court of Appeal had erred in stating that it had no power to say that the promise, and the resulting benefit, was disproportionate to the detriment. Proportionality was at the heart of the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, and it permeated its every application. In the circumstances, the appropriate relief was to award C one half of the plot of land.
