# El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings plc [1994] 2 All ER 685

EA was the victim of fraud involving DLH, a company run by fiduciaries. The question was whether a director described as a "nominee director with non-executive responsibility" was the company's directing mind and will for the purpose of establishing the liability of a company under a constructive trust. EA appealed against the dismissal of the action against DHL by Millett, J. ([1993] 3 All E.R. 717).

Held: Appeal allowed. Although the director may have had no general managerial responsibility in the company he did have management and control so far as the receipts of the fraud were concerned, having made all arrangements for the receipt and disposal of the money. The directing mind and will of the company was the individual who controlled its actions, _[Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd [1915] A.C. 705, [1915] 3 WLUK 17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE0019AF0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=57bd88afdd644cc594ad36b3f4a17d2f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. Being the directing mind and will of the company in the fraudulent transaction, the director incurred liabilities on behalf of the company which meant that the company had the requisite knowledge for EA to enforce a constructive trust against it.
