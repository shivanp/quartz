# Lyell v Kennedy (1889) 14 App Cas 437

FACTS: Ann Duncan owned land which was let to tenants. Kennedy collected rent on Ann’s  
behalf. Ann died intestate. There was a dispute about the identity of her heir.  
Kennedy continued to collect the rent. He paid the money into a separate bank account  
(rather than his own). And he told various people that the sum credited to the account  
belonged to Ann’s heir and would be paid to them immediately they were ascertained.  
Kennedy later claimed the sum for himself.

HELD: Kennedy held the sum credited to the account on trust for Ann’s heir.  
The fact that Kennedy had paid the money into a separate bank account was ‘indicative of  
some sort of trust’ and was ‘certainly not indicative of a personal right, claim, or interest on  
the part of Kennedy.’

The Earl of Selborne said:  

> A man who receives the money of another on his behalf, and places it specifically to an account with a banker ear-marked and separate from his own moneys, though under his control, is […] a trustee of the fund standing to the credit of that account. For the constitution of such a trust no express words are necessary; anything which may satisfy a Court of Equity that the money was received in a fiduciary character is  
enough
