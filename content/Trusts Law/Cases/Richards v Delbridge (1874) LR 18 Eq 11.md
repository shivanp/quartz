# Richards v Delbridge (1874) LR 18 Eq 11

**FACTS:** A grandfather wanted to assign a lease to his grandson who was a child at the time. He endorsed the lease with a memorandum stating: _‘This deed and all thereto belonging I give to Edward from this time forth.’_ He later died.

Endorsement on the lease was ineffective to assign the lease. It was necessary to use a separate deed. The gift had therefore not been validly constituted.

**HELD:** As in _Jones v Lock_, the grandfather had intended to make an outright gift and so, applying the rule in _Milroy v Lord_ this could not be treated as a self declaration of trust. The gift to the grandson therefore failed.

A person, who had a leasehold business premises and stock-in-trade, made a gift in favour of his grandson through a memorandum on the lease which stated, ‘This deed and all thereto belonging I give to E (the grandson)…with all the stock-in-trade.’ After his death, it was claimed that there was a declaration of trust. The English Court held that there had been no valid declaration of trust. A man might transfer his property, without valuable consideration, in two ways:  
(i) he might either do such acts as amount in law to a conveyance or assignment of the property, and divest himself of the legal ownership, in which case the person who by those acts acquired the property took it beneficially or on trust; or  
(ii) he might constitute himself a trustee by one of the modes recognised as a valid declaration of trust. He did not need to use the words, ‘I declare myself a trustee,’ but he should do something which was equivalent to it and use expressions which had that meaning.
