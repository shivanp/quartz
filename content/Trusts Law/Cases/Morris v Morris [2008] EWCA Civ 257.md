# Morris v Morris [2008] EWCA Civ 257

## Summary

There had been no evidence before a judge upon which he could properly have found a common intention constructive trust to exist in favour of a wife in relation to a property belonging to her ex-husband and his mother.

## Abstract

The appellant (H) appealed against the decision of a judge awarding the respondent (W) a beneficial share in a property.

Under the disposition of a will, H's mother (M) became the sole legal owner of the family farm. Consequently, H and M entered into a joint partnership for the purposes of running the farm and a joint tenancy in respect of the farmhouse that stood upon it. Later, H met and married W and began living with her in the farmhouse. At the beginning of their relationship, W provided substantial assistance to the farming business without any remuneration and was involved in most of the business decision-making. She also funded the purchase of an enclosure that added value to the property as a whole. Later, W wanted to open a riding school on the farm. She obtained a grant from a local authority and secured a loan from a company owned and managed by H. Both H and W agreed that no repayments on this loan would be necessary. W's riding business became very successful, and she incorporated a company for the purposes of managing its affairs. Following the dissolution of the relationship between H and W, W moved out of the farmhouse and instigated a claim for a beneficial interest in the farm premises. At trial, the judge awarded W a share of the farm in the amount of 25 per cent on the basis that the parties had conducted themselves in a manner giving rise to a common intention constructive trust in W's favour.

H submitted that the judge's inference as to the common intention of the parties was unfounded. In the absence of any express agreement or discussion between the parties in relation to W's beneficial interest, the judge had to look at the conduct of the parties. In the instant case, no reasonable observer would have thought that either H or M's encouragement of W's riding business, or their involvement of W in the affairs of the farm business, would be sufficient, of themselves, to give rise to a beneficial interest in the premises.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

In cases of this nature, conduct did not necessarily prove the fact, and the court would be cautious before interpreting the actions of spouses and cohabitees in relation to a property as necessarily granting some form of beneficial interest, _[James v Thomas [2007] EWCA Civ 1212, [2008] 1 F.L.R. 1598, [2007] 11 WLUK 610](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1A5CD7009A5211DC845ACDC7A80F3274/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2287704371824648ac0d9c00764a10e1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. In the instant case, the evidence in relation to the parties' conduct failed to support W's claim that she had obtained a beneficial interest in the property. Neither M nor H expressly discussed the matter of her entitlement to some interest, and W never raised the matter of her own volition. The involvement of W in the affairs of the farm business was no more than what might have been expected in the circumstances, and her financial contributions were mitigated by the contributions she, in turn, received in order to set up her own riding business, _[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432, [2007] 4 WLUK 407](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I20AB2C10F4AD11DB93178FA5B02D29F5/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2287704371824648ac0d9c00764a10e1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. There had been no evidence upon which the conduct of any of the parties might reasonably be said to have given rise to some beneficial entitlement. Accordingly, the evidence had failed to prove that there had been some exceptional conduct giving rise to a constructive trust, and the judge's conclusion to the contrary was a material error of law.
