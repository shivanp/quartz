## Perpetuity

### Trusts as Temporary

Trusts are not intended to be permanent arrangements. They are a temporary way of dealing with property. Some trusts are intended to last for only a very short period of time while others (such as trusts for minors) may last many years.

Where the beneficiaries of a trust have vested interests in the trust property, the rule in Saunders v Vautier provides a mechanism for bringing the trust to an end, allowing the beneficiaries to take full control of the property.

What about trusts under which the objects do not have vested interests, such as discretionary trusts or trusts which give rise to contingent interests? Even if the rule in Saunders v Vautier could theoretically be exercised by all the potential objects, in practice this is very unlikely. In the case of a discretionary trust, the trustees are obliged to exercise their discretion within a reasonable timeframe, limiting the duration of the trust. But what about trust interests which are limited by a contingency? If the contingency is never satisfied, how is the trust brought to an end?

### Limiting Trust Duration

Often a trust instrument will contain rules dealing with how and when the trust is brought to an end. It is good practice for a trust instrument to expressly limit the duration of the trust. You may see this described in the trust instrument as the ‘Trust Period’ or similar.

A well drafted trust instrument will ensure that the trustees have a mechanism for disposing of any trust property that remains at the end of this period. In the case of complicated trust arrangements (which may involve a mixture of trusts and powers) there will often be a gift-over clause providing for the property to be distributed to a particular beneficiary or beneficiaries. It is common for the ultimate recipient of the gift-over to be a charity, in case there are no other beneficiaries at the end of the trust period.

But what if there is no express limitation on the trust duration? Could it go on indefinitely? With the exception of charitable trusts, the answer to this question is no. It is not in the public interest for property to be tied up on trust indefinitely. The law therefore limits the duration of trusts by means of rules known as the perpetuity rules.

### Perpetuity Rules

There are two different sets of perpetuity rules which apply in different circumstances:

- The rule against remoteness of vesting.
- The rule against inalienability.

Broadly, the rule against remoteness applies to trusts with people or charities as their objects. It is important to consider this rule when establishing or administering a trust that does not immediately give rise to vested interests in the trust property (such as discretionary trusts and trusts which contain contingencies).

The rule against inalienability is a more limited rule which you only need to consider when advising on the establishment or operation of non-charitable purpose trusts.

### Remoteness of Vesting

The rule against remoteness of vesting is a statutory rule which requires that a person (or charity) must obtain a vested interest in the trust property within a recognised ‘perpetuity period’. By [s 5(1) Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/18/section/5) this period is 125 years although it is possible for a trust instrument to limit the duration of the trust to a shorter period. (It is not possible for a trust instrument to extend the 125 year perpetuity period.)

Any interest under a trust which does not vest within the statutory perpetuity period is void. This need not be clear from the outset of the trust. [s 7](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/18/section/7) contains a ‘wait and see’ rule which means that the trust can subsist until it becomes apparent that the interest cannot vest within the perpetuity period. Anything done before this will remain valid.

[Section 8](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/18/section/8) also contains ‘class closing’ rules which can save a trust by excluding objects who might otherwise cause the trust to fail because their interest would vest outside the perpetuity period.

#### Examples

The perpetuity rules will often be relevant when a trust contains conditions or powers particularly those involving a series of successive interests or a wide class of potential objects. The statutory perpetuity period is, however, designed to accommodate common uses for trusts. Consider the following examples:

- A trustee holds property on trust for A for life, remainder to B.
	- There is no problem with perpetuity in this case as B has a vested interest from the outset.
- A trustee holds property on trust for A for life, remainder to B if B survives A.
	- In this case B has a contingent interest so the perpetuity rules are technically relevant, but are extremely unlikely to be problematic. It is not certain that B’s interest will vest as A may die first. The wait and see rule applies, as the trust could fail for perpetuity, but only if A lives more than 125 years after the trust is created!
- A trustee holds property on trust for A (age 2) for life, the remainder to be divided equally between A’s children and grandchildren.
	- At the date the trust is created, only A has a vested interest in the trust property (and only in the income). When A dies, any of their children and grandchildren who have already been born will have vested interests.
	- However, there may be grandchildren yet to be born. As this is a fixed trust in equal shares, the trustee cannot divide the property between the objects until they are all ascertainable. It could take many years before it becomes impossible for more grandchildren to be born (however unlikely this may be).
	- Rather than the trust failing, the class closing rules will apply to limit the class of beneficiaries to A’s children and grandchildren, if any, who are alive as at the end of the perpetuity period.
	- The problem with this provision is not actually perpetuity but poor drafting. As we have already seen, the wait and see rule allows a trust to subsist for up to 125 years, until it is clear how the property should be distributed.
	- This means that at least some of the intended beneficiaries (i.e. A’s children) are practically unable to make use of their interest under the trust. To avoid this problem, the trust should contain a provision limiting the objects, as in the following example.
- A trustee holds property on trust for A for life, the remainder to be divided equally between such of A’s children and grandchildren as are living at the date of A’s death.
	- As we have seen, the main problem with the previous provision was not actually the perpetuity rules but with the drafting of the provision.
	- This next example solves the problem as it provides a date for the vesting of the remainder interest, ensuring that the beneficial interests fix as at A’s death.
	- Only A’s children and grandchildren who are living at that date obtain an interest, allowing the trustee to immediately divide the property between them. Any children or grandchildren who die before A or are born after A’s death are not included in the class. This means the trust property can be distributed immediately.
- A trustee holds property on trust for the first of the settlor’s lineal descendants to obtain a first class law degree.
	- This provision could be more problematic from a perpetuity perspective. Although the condition for obtaining a vested interest in the trust property is clear enough, it is unknown whether or when that condition might be satisfied.
	- The wait and see rule will apply here, meaning that the trustee will hold the property on trust for up to 125 years. If a lineal descendant of the settlor does satisfy the condition in that time, they will be entitled to the trust property. If nobody obtains such an interest within 125 years, the trust will come to an end.
	- A well drafted trust instrument will set out what happens at the end of the perpetuity period but if it is silent, there will be a resulting trust for the settlor or – more likely given the 125 year time period – the settlor’s estate.

What the rule is intended to prevent is the sort of situation where a settlor leaves a series of never-ending life interests for their descendants, with nobody obtaining a vested interest in the capital (and therefore no chance of collapsing the trust).

### Rule Against Inalienability

Before the implementation of the statutory perpetuity rules, there was a stricter common law perpetuity rule known as the against inalienability. This rule provides that assets cannot be tied up on trust for longer than the common law perpetuity period of a specified life in being plus 21 years (or just 21 years if no life in being is specified).

The common law rule is stricter than the statutory rule. There is no ‘wait and see’ rule. This means that where the common law perpetuity period applies, it must be clear from the outset that the trust will end within the prescribed perpetuity period. In practice, this typically means that the trust instrument must contain an express perpetuity period, limiting the duration of the trust. In the absence of such an express clause, the trust will typically fail.

This rule no longer applies to most trusts but remains relevant when it comes to non-charitable purpose trusts, as the statutory rule does not apply to them.

#### Examples

1. A testator leaves £10,000 on trust in their will, the income from which is to be used to maintain the grave of the testator.

This trust is clearly void for perpetuity. Only the income from the trust fund is to be used for the specified purpose, meaning that the capital will never be disposed of and the trust could go on forever.

1. A testator leaves £10,000 on trust in their will, from which both the capital and income are to be used to maintain the grave of the testator.

Although this trust provides for the capital to be used as well as the income, it will still be void for perpetuity because it is not clear when the capital will be used up. It is therefore not clear that it will come to an end within the common law perpetuity period of 21 years. For a trust like this to be valid, it must contain an express perpetuity period limiting its duration.

1. A testator leaves £10,000 on trust in their will, from which both the capital and income are to be used to maintain the testator’s pet tortoise.

Although this trust could be distinguished from the previous example on the basis that it will eventually come to an end when the tortoise dies, it is not clear that this will be within the 21 year perpetuity period. Indeed tortoises can live for a very long time! This trust would therefore be void.

1. A testator leaves £10,000 on trust in their will, from which both the capital and income are to be used to maintain the testator’s pet dog.

You might think that this example is different, on the basis that the dog is unlikely to live for longer than 21 years (particularly if it is already an older dog). Although the case law on this point is inconsistent, the courts tend to take a restrictive approach to the rule against inalienability and it is therefore highly likely that this trust would be void.

To ensure their validity, all non-charitable purpose trusts should include an express perpetuity clause.

### Express Perpetuity Clauses

A simple example would be to provide that the trust should last for 21 years. Another method that is sometimes used is an express perpetuity period for “as long as the law allows”. This would most likely be interpreted as the common law perpetuity period of 21 years but for the sake of certainty it is preferable not to use this. To extend the perpetuity period, it is possible to provide that it should only start running at the death of a named person. It is common to use a Royal lives clause such as:

> “£5,000 to my trustees on trust to maintain my grave for a period not exceeding 21 years following the death of the last surviving descendant of Queen Elizabeth II who is alive at the date of my death."

> [!summary]
> The statutory rule against remoteness of vesting applies to trusts with people or charities as their objects.
> - The statutory perpetuity period is 125 years. The trust property must vest in a person or charity at the end of that period.
> - It does not need to be clear from the outset that the trust property will vest within 125 years. The ‘wait and see’ rule applies.
> - The class closing rules apply at the end of the statutory perpetuity period.
> 
> The common law rule against inalienability applies to non-charitable purpose trusts.
> - The common law perpetuity period is 21 years.
> - It must be clear from the outset of the trust that it will come to an end within the common law perpetuity period. It is not possible to wait and see.
> - The common law perpetuity period can be extended by reference to a life in being. A common way to do this is by way of a Royal lives clause.
