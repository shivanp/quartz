## Common Intention Constructive Trusts

> ‘In law, ‘context’ is everything and the domestic context is very different from the commercial world.’  
> Baroness Hale, [[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]]

> [!question]
> In the domestic context of the shared family home, when will equity impose a trust?

For many couples, the family home will be the most significant asset that they own. Disputes as to ownership of the home are likely to arise in two broad circumstances:

- When the relationship breaks down
- When one of them dies and their estate is being administered
- On divorce or dissolution of a civil partnership, the court has discretion under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 or Civil Partnership Act 2004 to allocate ownership fairly between the parties.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as a “common law” marriage. There are no equivalent statutory provisions applicable to the breakdown of a relationship between cohabitees.

The statutory provisions also do not apply if a claim is made by a third party, such as a mortgagee or someone entitled to inherit the estate of one of the cohabitees.

### Who Owns the Property?

The absence of a statutory framework for cohabiting couples is an increasingly prevalent issue as many couples choose not to marry or become civil partners.

So how does the court decide who owns the property and in what proportions in these circumstances?

#### Legal Ownership

At law, the owner of the property is whoever holds legal title to it. For registered land, this means the person registered as legal owner at the Land Registry.

Sole owners: If the property is registered in the sole name of one party, then, at law, the property will belong to that party.

Joint owners: If the property is registered in joint names, the couple will own the property as legal joint tenants.

But what if the legal title does not represent the true position?

### Disputes Over Ownership

Disputes over the home arise if the legal title is not representative of the beneficial ownership of the property. Disputes tend to arise in two circumstances:

1. Sole owner: Where legal title to the property is registered in the name of one party only, but the other claims a beneficial interest in the property
2. Joint owners: Where legal title to the property is registered in the name of both parties, but there is no declaration as to their beneficial interest, and it is claimed that the parties are not beneficial joint tenants.

In these circumstances, trusts will determine the beneficial ownership of the home.

### Legal and Equitable Co-ownership

It is important to understand that legal title to land can only be held as either:

- Sole legal owner
- Joint tenants

The legal owner(s) may hold that legal title in one of the following ways:

- As full legal and beneficial owner. (i.e., there is no separate equitable title)
- On trust for a sole beneficiary
- On trust for more than one beneficiary as joint tenants
- On trust for more than one beneficiary as tenants in common in equal shares
- On trust for more than one beneficiary as tenants in common in unequal shares

| Example                                                                               | Legal title | Equitable title  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| A holds land on trust for A and B as equitable joint tenants.                         | A           | A and B          |
| A holds land on trust for B as sole beneficial owner.                                 | A           | B                |
| A and B hold land on trust for B as sole beneficial owner.                            | A and B     | B                |
| A and B hold land on trust for A and B as equitable joint tenants.                    | A and B     | A and B          |
| A holds land on trust for A and B as tenants in common in equal shares.               | A           | A (50%), B (50%) |
| A and B hold land on trust for A and B as tenants in common in the proportions 80/20. | A and B     | A (80%), B (20%) |

### Is There an Express Trust?

Ideally, the legal owners of land will declare an express trust over it, putting the question of beneficial ownership beyond doubt.

If there is written evidence of an express trust which satisfies s53(1)(b) LPA 1925 this will determine the beneficial interests in the property ([[Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] AC 777]]).

The Land Registry TR1 form (which is needed to transfer legal title to land) includes provision for specifying equitable ownership. Completing this satisfies [s53(1)(b) LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/53).

The problem is that this section of the form is not compulsory and many people do not complete it. It is therefore presumed that the beneficial ownership of the land mirrors the legal ownership ([[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]]).

### Common Intention Constructive Trusts

As we have seen, a problem arises when cohabitees do not declare an express trust. In such cases, it is necessary to consider the availability of constructive trusts.

Although purchase money [[resulting trusts]] were previously used in these situations (meaning the beneficial ownership reflected the couple’s respective contributions to the purchase price) it has been made extremely clear that they have no place to play in determining the beneficial ownership of family homes ([[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53]]).

Common intention constructive trusts provide a more flexible mechanism for determining beneficial ownership, allowing the court to take into account a wider range of factors than simple monetary contributions to the home. Since the seminal case of Stack v Dowden, it has been clear that the court must take an ‘holistic approach’ to this exercise, considering all the circumstances of the case before determining whether the beneficial ownership of the home is different to the legal ownership.

### Historiography

Before considering the modern law in this area, it is useful to look briefly at the way in which the common intention constructive trust developed over time (from the 1970s to the late 2000s).

Traditionally the case law in this area involved legal title being registered in the sole name of one party to the relationship (almost always a man) with the other person (usually a woman) seeking to establish that they had nonetheless acquired an equitable interest in that land.

Given the inflexibility of [[resulting trusts]] (which only gave individuals an equitable interest if they could establish that they had contributed towards the property acquisition or payment of the mortgage) the courts turned to constructive trusts.

Instead of looking only to financial contributions to the purchase of a property, common intention constructive trusts reflect the common intention of the parties.

Such intention can be either:

- Express: (i.e., based on express statements as to ownership); or
 - Inferred (i.e., determined objectively based on the circumstances).

In the absence of an express intention, it was considered unlikely that anything other than financial contributions (including contributions towards household expenditure) would demonstrate common intention. It was also necessary for the claimant to establish they had detrimentally relied on that intention.

### Stack V Dowden

Stack v Dowden was a highly significant case for two reasons:

1. It involved land which was held by joint legal owners
2. The House of Lords indicated that a holistic approach should be adopted when determining equitable ownership

This shift towards a ‘holistic approach’ suggested that the common intention constructive trust doctrine was more flexible than previously thought, allowing the court to take into account a much wider range of factors than those articulated in the earlier case law. In particular, it suggested that the court did not need to be constrained by dicta from the 1990s indicating that only financial contributions could be taken into account when inferring a common intention.

The starting point is that equitable title reflects legal title. In other words:

- A sole legal owner is the sole beneficial owner
- Joint legal owners are presumed to be equitable joint tenants.
- In sole legal ownership cases, an individual seeking to establish a beneficial interest will need to establish that they have acquired an interest under a common intention constructive trust.
- This requires proof of
  - (i) a common intention that they should have a beneficial interest and
  - (ii) detrimental reliance upon that intention.

In joint legal ownership cases, an individual seeking to establish that they are not beneficial joint tenants will need to rebut the presumption with reference to the common intention of the parties. **There is no need to show detrimental reliance**. In both cases, the court is seeking to establish the actual intention of the parties, whether express or inferred based on the ‘whole course of conduct’.

Intention can be **ambulatory**, meaning a beneficial interest can be established, or the presumption of joint tenancy rebutted, after acquisition (if circumstances change).

Once common intention (and, in sole ownership cases, detrimental reliance) has been established, it is necessary to quantify the interests of the parties. Again, this involves taking into account ‘the whole course of conduct’ in order to reach a conclusion as to the appropriate shares.

- If an express intention as to quantification can be established, the court will give effect to that intention.
- If an express intention cannot be established, the court will attempt to infer an intention based on the conduct of the parties.
- As a last resort, if it is not possible to ascertain the actual intention of the parties as to quantification of their shares, the court will impute an intention for ‘fair shares’ based on all the ‘whole course of conduct’.

## Joint Legal Owners

This element explores the operation of common intention constructive trusts, where legal title to the home is held jointly.

> ‘…cases in which the joint legal owners are to be taken to have intended that their beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests will be very unusual.’  
> Baroness Hale, [[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]]

> [!question]
> In what circumstances will joint legal owners be taken to have intended to have different beneficial interests?

### Joint Legal Ownership: The Issue

Cohabitees who purchase a family home in joint names do not always specify their respective equitable and beneficial entitlements.

In the absence of an enforceable express trust over the property, it is presumed that they are equitable joint tenants. This reflects their legal ownership of the property and the maxim that ‘equity follows the law’ ([[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]]).

As the parties have chosen to purchase the property in joint names, this presumption is very hard to rebut, and requires **strong evidence** of a common intention that they were intended to be anything other than joint tenants in equity too.

### Joint Legal Ownership: The Presumption

In Stack v Dowden, Lady Hale stated that the starting point in all family homes cases is that “equity follows the law”.

> [!test] Two-step process
> Following on from Stack v Dowden, in [[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53]] the Supreme Court confirmed the two-step approach in joint legal ownership cases:
> 1. Step 1: Rebutting the presumption – did the parties have a common intention to hold the property other than as joint tenants?
> 2. Step 2: Quantification - if the parties are not joint tenants, they must be tenants in common. But in what proportions?

### Step 1: Rebutting the Presumption

To establish that legal title does not reflect beneficial ownership of the home, it is necessary to rebut the presumption that equity follows the law. There are two broad scenarios to consider:

- The person seeking to rebut the presumption may simply argue for a beneficial tenancy in common in equal shares. This is most likely in cases involving a dispute about beneficial ownership of the land after the death of one of the legal owners. If the property was held as joint tenants, it will pass to the other owner(s) by survivorship. For a share of the property to pass to the deceased person’s estate, it is necessary to demonstrate that they were tenants in common.
- More often, the person seeking to rebut the presumption will be seeking to argue that the parties are beneficial tenants in common in unequal shares. This will often be the case where the couple have separated and are disputing their respective entitlements to the home, with one (or both) arguing for a greater than 50% share.

#### “Whole Course of conduct”

As the starting point is just a presumption, it is possible to rebut it by adducing evidence that the parties were not intended to be equitable joint tenants.

Lady Hale in Stack v Dowden concluded that the presumption could be rebutted by evidence of the parties’ shared intention, which may be ascertained in the light of the whole course of conduct (known as the ‘holistic’ approach).

Lady Hale produced a non-exhaustive list of factors that may be taken into account when carrying out this exercise:

- Advice or discussions the parties had which may indicate their intention
- The reason legal title was registered in particular names
- The purpose for which the parties acquired the house
- The nature of the relationship
- Whether the parties have children
- How the house was financed
- How the parties arranged other finances and divided responsibility for household expenses.

#### Applying Factors

Lady Hale made clear in Stack that the presumption will not be rebutted lightly in cases of joint legal ownership. It is for the party seeking to rebut the presumption to adduce the relevant evidence, which is a “heavy burden” requiring “unusual facts”.

Although she did not indicate the weight to be attributed to any of the individual factors, it is clear from the subsequent case of Jones v Kernott that the court is looking for the **actual intention** of the parties. The best evidence of that intention will therefore be evidence relating to express agreements or discussions as to beneficial ownership.

In the absence of any such express discussions, it seems clear from Stack itself that **financial factors** are of particular importance to this exercise. (Indeed, financial considerations were so essential to the analysis in Stack itself that Lord Neuberger, dissenting, reached the same conclusion as the majority by applying a resulting trust analysis.)

### Step 2: Quantification

Once common intention (has been established, it is necessary to quantify the interests of the parties. Again, this involves taking into account ‘the whole course of conduct’.

As with Step 1, the primary search is for the actual intention of the parties (whether express or inferred). The court’s aim is to determine the proportions in which the parties actually intended to hold the land.

However, as a last resort, the court will impute an intention for ‘fair shares’ based on the ‘whole course of conduct’.

The same factors are taken into account at this stage of the process. Clearly, an express agreement or discussion as to the parties’ respective shares is the best evidence of what they intended. If there is such evidence, this is how the shares will be quantified.

In the absence of an express agreement as to quantification, the case law again indicates that financial factors will carry the greatest weight.

> [!note]
> Although it was made clear in [[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]] that the presumption will only be rebutted in exceptional cases, Stack itself was one of those cases.

### Post-_Stack_ Case Law

Exactly what will be deemed sufficiently ‘unusual’ to depart from the presumption of joint tenancy remains unclear.

In _Stack_ the court was persuaded the presumption was rebutted by the rigid separation of the couple’s finances. Yet Stack also made clear that the law has moved on from the very restrictive approach adopted in the 1990s and that financial matters alone are not the only factors to be taken into account.

The case law suggests that the courts will only depart from the presumption in exceptional cases.

[[Fowler v Barron [2008] EWCA Civ 377]] demonstrates that unequal financial contributions alone are not enough. If a couple choose to buy a home in joint names, it does not matter that only one of them has made financial contributions to that house. Further evidence is required to rebut the presumption of joint tenancy.

In Fowler itself, the Court of Appeal held that a man who had paid the deposit, all mortgage payments and all direct outgoings was unable to rebut the presumption of joint beneficial ownership.

Compare Fowler v Barron with [[Adekunle v Ritchie [2007] BPIR 1177]], where the claimant did successfully rebut the presumption of joint tenancy.

Jones v Kernott is a significant case, being a Supreme Court case decided just a few years after Stack v Dowden. In addition to clarifying some of the points made in Stack (most notably the question of whether and when it is possible to impute intention) it is an interesting case in its own right because of the conclusion that intention can be ambulatory.

What this means is that it is possible for the common intention of the parties to change over time. In some cases, such as in Jones v Kernott itself, it may be concluded that the parties had a common intention to hold the property as joint tenants when it was first acquired, but that intention changed at a later date (such as following the end of the relationship). At that date, their interests in the property ‘crystallise’ and subsequent events (e.g., capital growth of the land) are considered when quantifying their respective interests.

### Jones V Kernott: Rebutting the Presumption

Jones v Kernott provides good insight into the considerations relevant to quantification. However, there were disagreements within the Supreme Court as to the role of imputation.

Lady Hale and Lord Walker stressed that, even at this stage, the primary aim should be to infer the intention of the parties based on the whole course of conduct and Lady Hale’s non-exhaustive list of factors.

However, they accepted that as a ‘fallback’ position, the court may be required to impute an intention to the parties based on “what their intentions as reasonable and just people would have been had they thought about it at the time”.

The minority disagreed that imputation was permissible at all, while Lord Collins was not concerned with the conceptual difference between inference and imputation.

As both inference and imputation require the court to take account of the whole course of conduct (and Lady Hale’s non-exhaustive list of factors), some might agree with Lord Collins that there is little practical difference between them.

However, the distinction remains relevant, with the Court of Appeal confirming in [[Barnes v Phillips [2015] EWCA Civ 1056]] that imputation can only occur at the quantification stage, but not when rebutting the presumption of joint tenancy.

> - When dealing with a property in which the parties are joint legal owners the starting point is that ‘equity follows the law’.

## Sole Legal Owners

> Lord Diplock, [[Gissing v Gissing [1971] AC 886]]

### Issue

How can a person without a legal interest in the land show that there was an intention for them to have a share in the family home?

Sometimes cohabitees live in a family home which is only registered in the name of one of the parties. This may be because that person bought the home before they entered into the relationship, or there may be some other reason why it was considered appropriate to only register the house in their name. (Many older cases involve land being purchased as a home for a man and woman to live in as a couple, but only the man was registered as the legal owner).

In the absence of an enforceable express trust over the property, the legal owner will be the sole beneficial owner unless the other person is able to establish an interest under a common intention constructive trust.

This element considers the use of common intention constructive trusts to determine beneficial ownership of homes owned by a sole legal owner, in light of the decision in [[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]].

### Starting Point

In Stack v Dowden, Lady Hale stated that the starting point in all family homes cases is that “equity follows the law”. Although the case involved property held in joint names, the broad principles established in the case are also applicable to sole legal owners.

If land is held by a sole legal owner, equity follows the law, meaning they are also the sole beneficial owner unless there is an enforceable trust over the property.

> [!test] Two-step process
> Since _Stack v Dowden_ there has been a series of cases applying the principles to sole legal ownership cases. The following two step process has emerged from these cases:
> 
> **Step 1: Establishing an interest**
> 
> Did the parties have a common intention for the non-legal owner to acquire a beneficial interest? Has that person relied on this to their detriment?
> 
> **Step 2: Quantification**
> 
> If the non-legal owner can establish an interest, what is the quantum of that interest as a proportion of the property?

### Step 1: Establishing an Interest

There are two traditional routes to a common intention constructive trust:

1. Evidence of an express common intention as to the shared ownership of the property, followed by detrimental reliance by the non-legal owner. Once an express common intention was established, a relatively wide range of conduct would satisfy the requirement of detrimental reliance.
2. In the absence of an express common intention, the court could also infer common intention from the parties’ conduct, again followed by detrimental reliance. In such cases, detrimental reliance would typically be inferred from the same conduct as the common intention. It was generally considered that only financial contributions (to the purchase, mortgage or household) would be sufficient for such purposes.

In order to establish an equitable interest, the non-legal owner will need to demonstrate common intention for them to acquire an interest in the land.

Lady Hale in Stack v Dowden indicated that common intention should be ascertained in the light of the whole course of conduct (known as the ‘holistic’ approach). She produced a non-exhaustive list of factors that may be taken into account:

- Advice or discussions the parties had which may indicate their intention
- The reason legal title was registered in particular names
- The purpose for which the parties acquired the house
- The nature of the relationship
- Whether the parties have children
- How the house was financed
- How the parties arranged other finances and divided responsibility for household expenses

Although the extension of this principle to sole legal owner cases was obiter in Stack itself, it is now very clear that this approach also applies to such cases.

### Express Common Intention

Although the holistic approach means that the court is now required to take into account a wider range of factors, the best evidence of common intention will still be express agreement or discussions regarding the ownership of the house.

The following principles (emanating from pre-Stack case law) remain useful when considering express discussions the parties had about the property:

- When assessing common intention, statements should be about shared ownership, not merely about shared occupation.
- Common intention to share ownership may be evidenced by the legal owner providing an excuse as to why their partner may not be jointly registered as the legal owner.

### Discussions: Ownership Vs Occupation

Compare the words used in the following examples from case law (bearing in mind that the words must be interpreted in the context of the individual case).

Words indicating ownership:

- “half yours” [[Hammond v Mitchell [1991] 1 WLR 1127]]
- "50:50" ([[Clough v Killey (1996) 72 P&CR D22]])

Insufficient for ownership

- “Family home” ([[Lloyds Bank v Rosset [1991] 1 A.C. 107]])
- “benefit…both of us” ([[James v Thomas [2007] EWCA Civ 121]])
- “You will be looked after” ([[Thomson v Humphrey [2009] EWHC 3576]])

### Excuses

As we have already seen, common intention may also be evidenced by the legal owner providing an excuse as to why their partner may not be jointly registered as legal owner.

- In [[Eves v Eves [1975] 1 WLR 1338]] an excuse was made that the partner couldn’t own property because she was under 21.
- In [[Grant v Edwards [1986] Ch 638]] it was suggested that sharing legal ownership would prejudice the partner’s divorce.
- However, recent case law suggests that inferences should not be drawn too readily from an excuse.
- In [[Curran v Collins [2015] EWCA Civ 404]], the Court of Appeal concluded that a common intention to share the beneficial ownership could not be inferred where the legal owner had made an excuse in order to avoid having an argument, rather than to prevent their partner obtaining an intended interest in the shared home.

### Inferred Common Intention

Although Stack v Dowden is the seminal case in this area, the groundwork for the decision was laid by the Court of Appeal in [[Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546]]. In this case (which related to sole legal ownership) the court suggested that the court could determine shares of the property based on what it considered fair in light of the parties’ “whole course of dealing” in relation to the property.

Lady Hale, drew on this case in her landmark judgment in Stack, endorsing Lord Walker’s view that the “law has moved on” from a focus on financial contributions.

The application of the Stack holistic approach to inferring intention in sole ownership cases was confirmed by the Privy Council in the sole ownership case of [[Abbott v Abbott [2007] UKPC 53]], in which Lady Hale reiterated that the law had “substantially moved on”.

### Holistic Approach

So how does the court apply the holistic approach to inferring common intention in sole legal ownership cases?

Many of the cases decided before Stack rejected the relevance of factors such as the performance of household duties, staying at home to look after children, contributions to utility bills or doing repair and maintenance jobs around the house. Although Stack seemed to widen the factors that could be taken into account, a series of cases decided shortly after it still seemed to take quite a restrictive approach to inferring common intention. The court’s view in these cases seemed to be that what was done was because the parties were making their lives together and was not referable to a common intention as to ownership of the property.

See Thomson v Humphrey in which the court declined to infer common intention as a result of an individual caring for family, [[Walsh v Singh [2009] EWCA 3219 (Ch)]] where a woman gave up her career or [[Morris v Morris [2008] EWCA Civ 257]] where a woman worked without pay.

In contrast, in [[Graham-York v York [2015] EWCA Civ 72]] a woman lived in an abusive and controlling relationship with her partner. The judge held that during the 33 years she lived with him her financial contributions to the household did ‘not amount to much’ although she did cook all the family meals and cared for their daughter. Inferred common intention was found and she was awarded a 25% share in the property.

Prior to Stack (see e.g. [[Burns v Burns [1984] 1 All ER 244]] and [[Le Foe v Le Foe [2001] 2 FLR 970]]) it was suggested that indirect financial contributions such as paying substantial contributions to family expenses to enable the other party to pay the mortgage, should be taken into account.

However in [[James v Thomas [2007] EWCA Civ 1212]] (decided shortly after Stack) a woman had made very substantial improvements to the property (including heavy labour) and gave up her job to work for the man’s business, thereby making it easier for him to make mortgage payments (which came from their joint account). Despite this, common intention was not inferred.

Both Lord Walker and Lady Hale suggested in obiter in Stack that making substantial improvements which significantly added value to the property would be capable of creating an interest.

This was applied by the High Court in [[Aspden v Elvy [2012] EWHC 1387 (Ch)]]. Common intention was inferred by a man’s substantial contributions in work and money (around £65,000-£70,000) in converting a barn which substantially increased the land’s value. The weight given to each of the factors (i.e. the work and the financial contribution) by the court in Aspden was unclear.

### Detrimental Reliance

#### Inexplicable Conduct

If the claimant is able to establish the relevant common intention, they must also establish detrimental reliance.

In [[Grant v Edwards [1986] Ch 638]] Nourse LJ considered that amounted to conduct which is “otherwise inexplicable”. He noted that there was a clear distinction between conduct such as merely moving into a house and a small woman wielding a 14lb sledgehammer (the conduct of the successful claimant in Eves v Eves). The latter involved "conduct which the [claimant] could not reasonably have been expected to embark unless [s]he was to have an interest in the house”.

### Conduct Relating to Joint Lives?

Browne-Wilkinson LJ provided a more expansive definition, considering that once common intention is established “any act done by her to her detriment relating to the joint lives of the parties is….sufficient”.

The case predates Stack v Dowden and it might be argued that this wider interpretation is more consistent with the holistic approach of Lady Hale. His judgment was referred to with approval by the Court of Appeal in [[Parris v Williams [2008] EWCA Civ 1147]].

#### Examples of Detrimental Reliance

- Sufficient
	- In [[Eves v Eves [1975] 1 WLR 1338]] heavy DIY was considered to amount to detrimental reliance.
	- Similarly in [[Clough v Killey (1996) 72 P&CR D22]] renovations to the house counted.
	- In [[Grant v Edwards [1986] Ch 638]] payment of substantial expenses (including payment of the mortgage) was conduct which the women would not otherwise have embarked upon without an interest in the home.
- Not sufficient
	- In [[Lloyds Bank v Rosset [1991] 1 A.C. 107]] decorating did not amount to detrimental reliance.
	- In [[Burns v Burns [1984] 1 All ER 244]] giving up work and to look after children was not enough.
	- In [[Thomson v Humphrey [2009] EWHC 3576]] looking after the family and playing the “traditional wife” was not enough.

### Step 2: Quantification

As we have seen, once a common intention constructive trust is established, the court is required to quantify the size of the non-legal owner's interest, using the following framework:

- If there is evidence of express common intention as to the shares this ought to be conclusive
- In the absence of such an intention, the same approach is taken as in joint ownership cases; the court ought to strive to infer the common intention
- If this is not possible they may impute an intention for ‘fair shares’ in light of the ‘whole course of dealing’

Although early post-Stack cases on sole ownership did not clearly differentiate between the acquisition and quantification stages, it is now very clear from cases such as [[Capehorn v Harris [2015] EWCA Civ 955]] that the two stages are distinct.

Likewise any uncertainty as to whether and when the court may impute an intention to the parties has been clarified by the Court of Appeal in [[Barnes v Phillips [2015] EWCA Civ 1056]], confirming that imputation is only permissible at quantification stage.

#### Problems with Imputation

The question of when imputation is permissible remains controversial, especially as the lower courts seemed quick to impute shares in the early cases following Jones v Kernott.

In [[Aspden v Elvy [2012] EWHC 1387 (Ch)]] the High Court considered the contributions of both money and physical labour by Mr Aspden and imputed an that he should have a 25% share of the home. Judge Behrens considered that this represented a “fair return for the investment of £65,000-£70,000 and the work carried out by Mr Aspden”. He acknowledged that the figure was “somewhat arbitrary” but said that it was the best he could do with the available material.

The willingness of lower courts to impute shares at the quantification stage has given rise to concerns (as expressed by Lord Neuberger in his dissent in Stack v Dowden) that the process has become unprincipled, and arguably a smokescreen for judicial discretion.

The Court of Appeal dealt with this issue in the sole ownership case of [[Graham-York v York [2015] EWCA Civ 72]]. The couple in this case had a dysfunctional relationship and Mr York was both controlling and violent. The Court of Appeal rejected Miss Graham-York’s argument that her interest should have been quantified at 50%, upholding the trial judge’s allocation of a 25% share. In imputing an intention for “fair shares” the Court of Appeal reiterated that this must be ascertained in light only of the parties’ dealings with the property stating that the “the court is not concerned with some form of redistributive justice”.

The Court of Appeal held that it is not the role of the court to reallocate property rights based on other matters (such as the presence of domestic violence in the relationship), which have no link to the acquisition of the property.

Beneficial interests in property may have been determined by an express declaration of trust. Such a trust will need to be evidenced in signed writing to be enforceable. But it is unlikely that parties in a domestic context will have considered what their respective beneficial interests in the property might be.

### Resulting Trust

It has been recognised in the context of a cohabiting couple who purchase a property in their joint names for their joint occupation that the resulting trust will usually have no role to play in determining their beneficial interests in the family home, regardless of whether they have made a financial contribution to the acquisition of the property ([[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53]]). This has been extended to where the property was purchased as an investment by parties who are in a personal relationship ([[Marr v Collie [2018] AC 361]]). Partly for policy reasons, with the dramatic inflation in property prices.

Note also that where the home of a married couple was transferred to a company, it was appropriate to infer that the property was held by the company on resulting trust for the spouse who owned and controlled the company.

### Institutional Constructive Trust

The institutional constructive trust is relevant where property has been acquired by one party and another party seeks to assert a beneficial interest in it. This is particularly significant in the commercial context where the property has been acquired to be developed y both parties as a joint venture.

### Common Intention Constructive Trust

The common intention constructive trust is particularly significant in determining the beneficial interests in the family home. Note that although this trust can be established by reference to the intentions of the parties, it is not because any agreement or understanding between the parties will have been expressed orally rather than in writing. So as an express trust of land it will be unenforceable, but as a constructive trust, it will be valid and enforceable despite the absence of writing. It is preferably analysed as an implied trust, though this also has issues.

One form of common intention constructive trust is the express common intention constructive trust, which arises where there is an express agreement between the parties in respect of the beneficial interests in a property. This is similar to an express trust, but fails to comply with the formalities for the creation of such a trust. Such a trust usually arises in a commercial context.

### Proprietary Estoppel

This is where the claimant has relied to their detriment on an assurance that they will acquire an interest in property belonging to the defendant, and as a result the court recognises that they have a beneficial interest in the property.

There is a lot in common between [[proprietary estoppel]] and CICTs, but they should be analysed separately, despite sharing a common rationale of responding to unconscionability.

### CICT

The CICT has replaced the resulting trust as the means of dealing with the proprietary consequences of a relationship breakdown. It has been recognised that it was developed “to mitigate the arithmetic rigour of the resulting trust when ascertaining property rights upon the breakdown of a relationship in the domestic context”.

The old formulation from [[Lloyds Bank v Rosset [1991] 1 A.C. 107]] was

1. where parties have expressed a common intention to share the beneficial interest, followed by detrimental reliance by the claimant that is referable to that common intention. This makes it unconscionable for the defendant to deny the claimant's beneficial interest in the property, and give rise to either CICT or PE. The detrimental reliance can take the form of non-financial contributions like renovations to property.
2. Where a common intention to share the beneficial interest can be inferred because the claimant has made a financial contribution to the purchase price, or to the payment of mortgage instalments.

But then the House of Lords reconsidered the requirements in [[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]]. The reasoning was clarified by SC in [[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53]].

#### Principles

If there is an express declaration of trust, that is the end of the matter.

#### Presumptions

'Equity follows the law', so the rebuttable presumption is that the equitable ownership is whatever is on the title deed.

Where the property is registered in the name of one party only, the other will need to establish that there was a common intention, objectively determined, which may be express or inferred from conduct. The party will then need to establish what proportion of the beneficial interest would be fair, having regard to the whole course of dealing between parties. The burden of proving that the other party should have a beneficial interest at all is a heavy one, and does not involve the imputation of intent with reference to what the court considers fair, but just what the parties expressly agreed or can be inferred to have agreed, with regard to direct and indirect financial contributions.

The next stage involves quantifying the beneficial interest. The other party will need to establish that they acted to their detriment in reliance on the common intention that they would have an interest in the property. Imputation of intent and the question of fairness are relevant here. Denying this interest to the party who has relied on the common intention can be characterised as unconscionable.

Where the property is registered in the name of both parties, the party who claims that the beneficial interest is apportioned otherwise than equally bears the burden of proving that a different apportionment was intended. Again, this is a heavy burden, and it is only in very unusual cases where the beneficial interest is not shared equally (like the facts in [[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]] or [[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53]]).

The reason for this is when a couple in an intimate relationship buy a property to live in together, often with a mortgage for which they are jointly and severally liable, this is strong evidence of an emotional and economic commitment to a joint enterprise.

When rebutting the presumption, the focus is very strongly on what the parties did intend/ must be taken to have intended, rather than what the court considers fair.

#### Relevant Factors

Lady Hale said the following were relevant:

- Advice or discussions at the time of the purchase that cast light on the parties' intentions
- The reasons for joint/ sole legal ownership
- Nature of relationship
- Children?
- Financing purchase
- Arrangement of finances
- Arrangement of outgoings and household expenses
- Characters and personalities.

An express common intention is conclusive. If an express common intention cannot be established, can such an intention be objectively inferred from the evidence? An inferred intent is an actual intent which can be deduced objectively from the parties' conduct.

Imputation of common intention is very controversial, as taking English law a 'hair's breadth away' from a remedial constructive trust. In [[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53]] it was clarified that the court should primarily be concerned with searching for the parties' actual shared intentions subject to two exceptions where such an intention should be imputed.

1. As a result of a presumption of resulting trust (though not generally applicable in a domestic context)
2. Where it was clear that parties intended to share the beneficial interest, but it was not possible to determine a common intention as to the proportions in which the interest was to be shared.

Where imputation of an intention is required, the court must considered what is fair having regard to the whole course of dealing in respect to the property, which includes the financial contributions made by the parties and all the above factors again. When determining what is fair, the court is not seeking to effect redistributive justice ([[Graham-York v York [2015] EWCA Civ 72]]).

The court in [[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53]] recognised that the practical difference between inference and imputation will probably be minimal.

It is preferable to maintain a clear conceptual division between inferring and imputing. If an intention cannot be imputed, the presumption of a joint tenancy will not have been rebutted and the parties will share in the value of the property equally.

The common intention of the parties might change over time (ambulatory intention), but compelling evidence will be required to establish a subsequent change in the beneficial ownership, such as a significant capital expenditure to the property, or the separation of the parties over a substantial period.

In [[Curran v Collins [2015] EWCA Civ 404]] it was recognised that in sole-ownership cases it is not enough to establish the common intention, the party who is asserting a share in the beneficial interest must also have relied to their **detriment** on this common intention. This requirement does not apply to joint ownership cases, and may prove to be a significant restriction on the identification of a share of the beneficial interest in sole-ownership cases. The test was not satisfied in that case. It is not appropriate for an equitable proprietary interest to be created where the claimant does not have any legal title to the property and has not contributed to the purchase of the property in any way.

In [[Marr v Collie [2018] AC 361]], two men were in a personal relationship for several years, during which they purchased various properties as investments. The Privy Council rejected the proposition that the CICT was confined to the domestic setting, and extended it to where the property had been purchased as a commercial investment if there was a personal relationship between the parties.
