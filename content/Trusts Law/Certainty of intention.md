# Certainty of intention

## Certainty of Intention

Certainty of intention is one of the three certainties necessary for the creation of an express trust. Its rationale is quite simple.

By definition, an express trust is one which is brought into existence by an intention to create it (unlike, for example, some resulting and constructive trusts which arise independently of the parties’ intention).

Thus, an intention to create a trust is a necessary requirement for (in fact, it is the defining feature of) an express trust.

### Requisite Intention

For these purposes, the requisite intention is an intention to impose or assume the duty which is characteristic of a trust, i.e. a duty to hold property for, or apply it for the benefit of, a beneficiary (or purpose).

In [[Re Oldfield [1904] 1 Ch 549]], Kekewich J held that the woman had not created a trust, saying:

> ‘a desire carries no obligation except a moral one. To desire a person to do a thing is entirely different from telling him to do it.’

### Ascertaining Information

A person’s intention can be ascertained from their words (spoken or written) and conduct. Most trusts (other than trusts of land and testamentary trusts) have no prescribed formalities, meaning they can be created formally or informally, whether in writing or otherwise.

The courts adopt an **objective** approach in determining whether a person intended to create a trust. If they manifest an intention to impose or assume the duty which is characteristic of a trust, they intend to create a trust. It is irrelevant that they do not actually (i.e. subjectively) intend to create a trust or are unaware that such a thing even exists.

### Written Documents

In some situations, intention is reduced to writing; for example, in a contract or a will. The courts have developed the following principles which should be applied when interpreting such documents:

The intention of the author(s) of a document is ascertained by identifying the meaning of the words which they have used. And the meaning of words is ascertained by reference to:

- Their natural and ordinary meaning
- Any relevant contextual features of the document
- The facts which were known to or assumed by the author(s) of the document when it was created
- Common sense

### Use of the Word ‘trust’

Generally, the use of the word ‘trust’ is a **good indicator** that a person intends to create one. However, it is not determinative, either by its presence or its absence.

Crucially, the nature of a relationship or transaction is determined by reference to the substantive rights and duties which it creates and not by reference to how it has been characterised by the parties.

### Segregating / Earmarking Assets

A key determining factor in several important cases has been the segregation of funds in a **separate bank account** which has been earmarked for a particular person or purpose.

This is often good evidence of an intention to create a trust, but is neither necessary for the creation of a trust nor is it conclusive evidence that a trust is intended. Like all other factors, segregation and earmarking of assets must be considered within the specific factual context.

### Treating a Sole Bank Account as Joint

In the seminal case of [[Paul v Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527]] the court was persuaded that a bank account was held on trust (jointly for the legal owner and his partner) based largely on the repeated use of the words ‘this money is as much yours as mine’.

Another significant factor was the way in which the account was used (with the couple paying joint bingo winnings in and withdrawing funds for joint use).

The court acknowledged that this was a very borderline case and that it was difficult to pinpoint the precise moment at which the trust was created.

Of particular importance to the decision was the fact that the couple were ordinary people who were unfamiliar with the legal [[concept of a trust]]. The account holder could not be expected to use terminology he did not understand, but this did not preclude a finding that he intended a trust relationship.

This decision provides an important reminder that certainty of intention is a question which will turn on the very specific facts of a case. Words and conduct must be interpreted in context.

### Relationship with Other Certainties

In some situations, there is a significant interaction between certainty of intention and the two other certainties.

More particularly, there are cases where the subject matter or objects of an alleged trust are so vague or uncertain that the only sensible inference is that there was **no** intention to create a trust at all.

A trust is a duty. It is unlikely that a person intends to impose a duty if the alleged duty is so vague that the person required to discharge it is unable to identify what they are required to do.

For example, in [[Mussoorie Bank Ltd v Raynor (1882) 7 App Cas 321]], the testator gave all his property to his wife

> ‘Feeling confident that she will act justly to our children in dividing the same when no longer required by her.’

It was argued that the wife was a trustee of the property. The Privy Council rejected this argument. The indeterminate nature of both the (alleged) trust property and the quantum of the (alleged) beneficiaries’ interests had ‘a reflex action’ which demonstrated that the testator did not intend to create a trust at all.

## Summary

- Certainty of intention is a requirement for the creation of an express trust.
- The requisite intention is an intention to impose or assume the duty, which is characteristic of a trust.
	- In a contractual context, the parties’ intention is ascertained from the express terms of their contract and any implied terms.
	- This is illustrated by the Lehman Brothers case ([[In re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (in administration) [2009] EWHC 2545 (Ch).]])
- Intention is ascertained from a person’s words and conduct.
	- [[Lyell v Kennedy (1889) 14 App Cas 437]]
- The relevant intention is assessed objectively. The settlor does not even need to appreciate what a trust is.
	- [[Paul v Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527]]
- The use of the word ‘trust’ is neither necessary nor conclusive.
	- [[Re Kayford Ltd (in liquidation) [1975] 1 WLR 279]]
- The fact that a transaction is characterised by the transacting parties as a trust is not conclusive as to its nature.
	- [[Modelboard Ltd v Outer Box Ltd (in liquidation) [1993] BCLC 623]]
- Conversely, the fact that a transaction is characterised as something other than a trust does not prevent it taking effect as a trust if it generates the duty which is characteristic of a trust.
	- [[Don King Productions Inc v Warren [2000] Ch 291]]
