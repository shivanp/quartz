# Certainty of objects

## Introduction

>‘As it is a maxim, that the execution of a trust shall be under the control of the court, it must be of such a nature, that it can be under that control …. unless … the objects can be ascertained … it must be decided, that the court can neither reform maladministration, nor direct a due administration.’  
> Lord Eldon LC, [[Morice v Bishop of Durham (1805) 10 Ves Jun, 522, 539-540]].

Certainty of objects is one of the three certainties necessary for the creation of an express trust. The objects of a trust need to be certain so that the trust can be regulated and (if necessary) enforced by the court. Usually the objects of a trust will be people (although it is possible to create trusts for permitted purposes). This element focuses on trusts where the objects are people.

Although we are focusing on trusts for people, we will continue to use the term ‘objects’ rather than ‘beneficiaries’. This is because the objects will not always be beneficiaries in the true sense, as will become clear when we discuss discretionary trusts.

If it is not possible to say who the objects are, it may not be possible to properly administer the trust.

## Test

The test of certainty of objects depends on the type of trust in question.

A greater degree of certainty is required for a fixed trust than for a discretionary trust, because the trustee is required to divide the property exactly as the settlor has instructed.

The trustees must know exactly who is to benefit (certainty of objects) and how much they are to receive (certainty of [[beneficial entitlement]]). If there is uncertainty, the trust will fail (in whole or in part).

In contrast, the power afforded to the trustee in a discretionary trust allows the courts to apply a less stringent test of certainty. This is because the trustees are not required to divide the property between all the objects, and thus they do not need to be able to identify them all.

Similarly, where a power of appointment exists, the donee of the power is not required to exercise the power. They therefore do not need to be able to identify all the potential objects of the power.

## Fixed Trusts

### Beneficial Entitlement

A fixed trust is a trust in which the settlor sets out the entitlement of each beneficiary in the trust instrument. The beneficiaries and their individual entitlements are ‘fixed.’ It is the nature of a fixed trust that each beneficiary has a definable interest in the trust fund.

In the simplest case, a fixed trust will have a single beneficiary who is entitled to the entire trust fund. If there is certainty as to who the settlor intended to benefit, there will be certainty of objects. If there is uncertainty as to the intended beneficiary, the trust will fail.

If a fixed trust is intended to have multiple beneficiaries, but there is uncertainty as to the identity of one or more of those beneficiaries, the trust will not necessarily fail completely. If the identifiable beneficiaries have a [[beneficial entitlement]] which is not dependent upon the entitlement of the uncertain beneficiaries, they can still take their interest.

> [!example]
> Consider the example of a trust to the settlor’s wife for life, remainder to their “favourite daughter”. A lack of certainty as to the identity of the remainder beneficiary will not prevent the life interest to the wife taking effect. The trust will only fail in part.

### Equal Distribution Between Class

Some fixed trusts will require the trustees to distribute property equally between the members of a class of objects. In such cases, the trustees must be able to say who all the beneficiaries are at the time when they begin distributing the trust fund.

The test for certainty of objects in such cases is therefore known as the **‘complete list test.’** It must be possible to draw up a complete list of all the beneficiaries: [[IRC v Broadway Cottages Trust [1955] Ch 20]]. It follows that such trusts require both conceptual and evidential certainty.

### Conceptual Certainty

‘Conceptual certainty’ refers to the precision of language used by the settlor to define the class of persons whom they intend to benefit.

It is sometimes described as ‘linguistic’ certainty. In other words, if the objects of the trust are not clearly defined, it will not be possible to draw up a conclusive list and the trust will fail.

### Powers of Appointment

As is the case with trusts, a power of appointment must satisfy the test of certainty of objects in order to be valid.

If the donee of a power is not able to determine who falls within the class of objects, they risk exercising the power improperly (i.e., by choosing a person who is not an object of the power).

Although the objects of a power have no right to require the donee of that power to exercise it in their favour, they can constrain the improper use of the power.

For the court to be able to make a judgment on such matters, it must be able to determine whether the individual making a claim (and any individual in whose favour the power is exercised) is, or is not, a member of the class of objects.

This does not mean it is necessary to identify every single member of the class. A power of appointment will be valid if it satisfies a test known as the ‘is/is not test’ (sometimes also known as the ‘any given postulant test’).

## Discretionary Trusts

### Trustee Obligations

Although the trustees of discretionary trusts must exercise their discretion, and therefore have an obligation to consider the range of possible beneficiaries, this does not mean they need to identify all of those people in order to exercise their discretion. Rather, they must carry out a survey of the class which is appropriate to the particular trust.

The extent of this exercise will therefore depend upon the breadth of the class of objects; in the case of a small, family trust the trustees are likely to consider every individual before exercising the power whereas with a larger, commercial trust (for example, a discretionary trust for the employees of a particular company) it may not be necessary to actively consider every single object before exercising the discretion in favour of a particular individual.

### Is/ Is Not Test

Prior to [[McPhail v Doulton [1971] AC 424]], it was thought that the complete list test applied to discretionary trusts. It was accepted that if the trustees refused to execute the trust, the court would, in the last resort, do so by ordering equal division among the beneficiaries, relying on the maxim ‘equality is equity.’ It necessarily followed from this that it was necessary to draw up a complete list of beneficiaries.

In rejecting this approach in McPhail, Lord Wilberforce emphasised that the court should try to give effect to the settlor’s intentions. In his opinion, equal division would often be an inappropriate method for doing this, as it would be the very last thing that the settlor intended. Lord Wilberforce continued that, although the trustees have a duty to consider the range of possible beneficiaries and to select from the class, this does not mean that ‘they must have before them, or be able to get, a complete list of all possible objects.’ He also highlighted the similarities between discretionary trusts and fiduciary powers of appointments. He concluded that discretionary trusts should be subject to the same test of certainty of objects as applied to fiduciary powers of appointment: the is/is not test.

The test requires a trustee to be able to say with certainty whether ‘any given individual is or is not a member of the class’. You may also see it described as the ‘any given postulant’ test.

### Conceptual Certainty

Conceptual certainty is clearly still a requirement: If the objects of the trust are not clearly defined, the trustees will not be able to apply the is/is not test with certainty.

If the definition is unclear, there will be categories of people of whom it is not possible to say with certainty whether they are intended to be objects or not:

- The trustees will therefore not be able to properly survey the class and therefore will not know the scope of their powers or duties.
- Potential claimants will not be able to determine whether they have a right to compel proper administration of the trust.
- And if there is an allegation that the trustees have made a distribution to someone outside the class, the court will not be able to say whether the trustees have acted inside or outside their powers.

> [!example]
> 
> Consider applying the is/is not test to the following classes of objects:
> 1. The ‘employees’ of a company
> 
> ‘Employees’ has a legal meaning so this term is conceptually certain. A well drafted trust deed would clearly specify whether it applied only to current employees or also extended to past/future employees of the company.
> 
> 2. The ‘children’ of an individual
> 
> ‘Children’ also has a legal meaning so is conceptually certain. However, a settlor should ensure that this accords with their personal intention. For example, adopted children are legally the children of the adoptive parent (and are not legally the children of the biological parents). Step-children are not legally the children of their step-parents. It will therefore sometimes be preferable to specify whether the class of objects includes step-children or biological children who are not the legal children of the individual.
> 
> 3. The ‘friends’ of an individual
> 
> This is the paradigmatic example of an uncertain class.
> 
> 4. The ‘relatives’ of an individual
> 
> The Court of Appeal decided that it was conceptually certain in [[Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (No 2) [1973] Ch 9]]. The judges did not reach a unanimous conclusion on its meaning; two concluded that it meant ‘descendants from a common ancestor’.

### Evidential Certainty

After the House of Lords in McPhail confirmed the test of certainty of objects applying to discretionary trusts, it remitted the case to the Chancery Division to apply the test. This resulted in an appeal to the Court of Appeal: [[Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (No 2) [1973] Ch 9]]. The term that caused a particular problem was ‘relatives.’ All three judges agreed that the term was conceptually certain, but they did not agree on the meaning of the word.

The law on evidential certainty for discretionary trusts is controversial, with the Court of Appeal in [[Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (No 2) [1973] Ch 9]] unable to reach agreement. On this particular point, each of the three judges gave a different opinion, meaning that there is no majority decision on the need for evidential certainty.

In practice, the judgment which is widely considered to be the most pragmatic (and thus most likely to be followed) is that of Sachs LJ who indicated that it is for the claimant to prove to the trustees’ satisfaction that they are within the class. If they cannot prove that they are in the class, they are considered to be outside it.

#### In Practice

Some examples:

1. A discretionary trust for the settlor’s children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren’ – A claimant would need to prove to the trustees that they meet the definition using documentary evidence (such as birth certificates).
2. A discretionary trust for the ‘past, present and future employees’ of a company – If the company had no record of past employees, the individuals concerned might still be able to prove they had been employed, e.g., by showing payslips.

In each case, if a claimant could not prove they were in the class, they would be treated as outside it. It is likely that the trust would be valid, notwithstanding the presence of some degree of evidential uncertainty.

### Administrative Unworkability

It is important to note that a discretionary trust could fail because the class of objects is too wide.

In [[McPhail v Doulton [1971] AC 424]], Lord Wilberforce said that a discretionary trust is void if the class of beneficiaries ‘is so hopelessly wide as not to form “anything like a class” so that the trust is administratively unworkable’. He gave as an example of such a class ‘all the residents of Greater London.’

This dictum has been applied by the courts to invalidate a discretionary trust for the inhabitants of West Yorkshire (as many as 2½ million potential beneficiaries).

The size of the class does not invalidate a fiduciary power of appointment because the donee of a fiduciary power has no obligation to exercise the power and thus no obligation to survey the class before doing so.

In [[Re Beatty [1990] 1 WLR 1503]], the court upheld a fiduciary power to appoint property to anyone (or any corporation) in the world.

## Virgo

Where the trust is an express trust for persons, the objects of the trust must be defined with sufficient certainty to enable the trustees, or, if they default, the court, to execute the trust according to the settlors or testator's intention. Need to consider:

1. The essential test of certainty
2. Whether it is possible to define with sufficient certainty the description of the class (conceptual certainty)
3. The ease of proving that someone is an object (evidential certainty)
4. Ascertaining where an object of the class is located
5. The size of the class, and
6. How sensible the settlor's or testator's intent was (the test of capriciousness).

### Fixed Trusts

1. The essential test of certainty
	- Complete list test: it must be possible to identify who all the beneficiaries are
	- So long as a complete list can be drawn up when the trust property is to be distributed, does not matter that a complete list cannot be drawn up when the trust is created.
	- If this is not possible, the trust will be void from the start.
2. Whether it is possible to define with sufficient certainty the description of the class (conceptual certainty)
	- Complete list test means that if the definition of the objects is unclear, it will not be possible to compile a complete list, so the trust will be void.
	- e.g., not possible to define who is a 'friend'.
3. The ease of proving that someone is an object (evidential certainty)
	- Even if the definition of the objects is certain, if it is not possible to prove who the objects are, the complete list test will not be satisfied.
4. Ascertaining where an object of the class is located
	- Doesn't matter for a fixed trust; the share of anybody who cannot be ascertained will be paid into court.
5. The size of the class
	- Generally not relevant for fixed trusts (complete list test restricts this anyway)
	- Giving money to everyone in a class is easier than making discretionary decisions between a large number of beneficiaries
6. How sensible the settlor's or testator's intent was (the test of capriciousness).
	- Not really relevant for fixed trusts.

### Fixed Trust Subject to a Condition

1. The essential test of certainty
	- The condition must also be certain
	- A stricter test is applied to a condition subsequent than a condition precedent.
	- A condition subsequent will be valid only if it can be known with certainty from the start the exact event that will result in the defeat of the beneficiary's interest.
		- If this cannot be established, the condition will be void.
		- e.g., in [[Clayton v Ramsden [1943] AC 320]] a condition subsequent that would have had the effect of forfeiting property held on trust if the beneficiary were to marry a 'person not of the Jewish faith' was void for uncertainty as to the meaning of being a member of that faith.
		- In [[Re Jones [1953] 1 Ch 125]], half the money held on trust for the testator's daughter was to be forfeited if she had a social or other relationship with a named person. This was held to be void for uncertainty, even though the trustees were expressly identified as being the arbiters of whether the daughter had entered into such a relationship, and even though the court had suggested a definition of what might constitute a relationship.
		- In [[Re Tepper's Will Trusts [1987] Ch 358]] beneficiaries were entitled to income from the testator's estate when they reached 25, provided they 'did not marry outside the Jewish faith'. This was characterised as a condition subsequent which could be uncertainty, but the court was willing to resolve this having regard to extrinsic evidence.
		- So courts now seem more concerned with respecting the wishes of the settlor/ testator if possible.
	- A condition precedent (which must be satisfied before the property can be distributed) will be valid if it can be said of just one person that they satisfy the condition ([[Re Barlow's Will Trusts]])
		- Here, the testatrix allowed any members of her family and friends to purchase pictures for a lower value. This was valid because there were some people so close to the testatrix that anyone would class them as friends, so at least one person satisfied the condition.
		- So there is no obligation on the trustee to survey the class, but the onus is placed on the object to show they satisfy the condition.
2. Whether it is possible to define with sufficient certainty the description of the class (conceptual certainty)
	- Lord Denning in [[Re Tuck's Settlement Trust]] recognised that conceptual uncertainty would not render a condition precedent void, whereas it would invalidate a condition subsequent.
	- But this is a silly distinction, so the better view is that conceptual uncertainty will render any condition ineffective, either as a matter of law or simply in practice.
3. The ease of proving that someone is an object (evidential certainty)
	- The burden of proving that the condition has been satisfied is borne by the object, so evidential uncertainty will not invalidate the condition, but simply mean the condition cannot be said to be satisfied by that particular object.
4. Ascertaining where an object of the class is located
	- If no object can be ascertained, the condition will lapse and the property will pass to those entitled to the residue.
5. The size of the class, and
	- Fixed trust unlikely to fail for this, burden on the object to establish that they are in the class.
6. How sensible the settlor's or testator's intent was (the test of capriciousness).
	- No authority for this.

### Discretionary Trusts

1. The essential test of certainty
	- The trustees are given discretion as to which objects are to be benefitted by distribution and in what proportion
	- This type of trust is sometimes described as a 'trust power' since there is an obligation to make an appointment, but the trustee has a discretion as to who will benefit.
	- For the power to be exercised, it is essential that trustees know from the outset who the potential beneficiaries might be.
	- In [[McPhail v Doulton [1971] AC 424]] the House of Lords rejected the fixed list test of certainty of objects for discretionary trusts. Lord Wilberforce doubted the maxim 'equity is equality' because it would rarely be what the settlor wanted
	- The complete list test will be applicable only when the settlor's intent is that, if the trustee does not make a selection from the objects, there will be division among them all.
	- In *McPhail*, the settlor established a fund for the benefit of the employees and ex-employees of a company, their relatives and dependents. The validity of the trust depended on if 'relatives' and 'dependants' were sufficiently certain objects. Lord Wilberforce formulated the 'given postulant' (is/ is not) test. Note that the same case was then referred to the Chancery division, and known as [[Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (No 2) [1973] Ch 9]].
2. Whether it is possible to define with sufficient certainty the description of the class (conceptual certainty)
	- The test of certainty of objects will not be satisfied if it is not possible to define the description of the class with sufficient clarity.
	- 'An inhabitant of West Yorkshire' has been held to be certain, as has 'being of Jewish blood' (defined as having some Jewish blood')
3. The ease of proving that someone is an object (evidential certainty)
	- In [[Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (No 2) [1973] Ch 9]], all three judges agreed the discretionary trust was evidentially certain but for different reasons. Sachs LJ concluded that the courts would never be defeated by evidential uncertainty. If a particular person were not proved to be within the class, they should be considered to be outside it. This would not render the trust void; it would simply mean the particular person was not an object under the trust. This is the preferred test.
4. Ascertaining where an object of the class is located
	- Irrelevant; just because it cannot be established where a particular object is, or even whether they are still alive, this just means they cannot receive a distribution under the trust.
5. The size of the class,
	- If a class of objects is so wide that it cannot be considered to be anything like a class, the trust will be considered administratively unworkable and will be void.
	- In [[R v District Auditor ex parte West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council [1986] RVR 24]], a trust for the inhabitants of West Yorkshire was invalidated.
	- In [[Re Harding [2008] Ch 235]] it was recognised that a trust for the black community of four London boroughs would have been treated as void for administrative unworkability had it not been a charitable purpose.
	- The rationale for this principle is not entirely clear; could be a policy against excessive delegation to the trustees by the settlor/ testator, who is expected to describe the objects with sufficient clarity.
	- Remember that in [[Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (No 2) [1973] Ch 9]] a discretionary trust for relatives was held to be valid
6. How sensible the settlor's or testator's intent was (the test of capriciousness).
	- If a settlor chooses to establish a trust for the residents of an area with which they have no connection and who they have no reason to benefit, this could be considered to be a capricious motive ([[Re Manisty]]). But note that no discretionary trust has to date been invalidated for capriciousness.

### Fiduciary Powers

1. The essential test of certainty
	- The test for certainty of objects for fiduciary powers is the is/ is not test ([[Re Gulbenkian's Settlements [1970] AC 508]]).
	- For enforcing the use of the power, it is vital that both trustees and the court are able to determine who are and are not objects of the power.
2. Whether it is possible to define with sufficient certainty the description of the class (conceptual certainty)
	- Concepts need a clear definition to be valid
3. The ease of proving that someone is an object (evidential certainty)
	- Same as discretionary trusts
4. Ascertaining where an object of the class is located
	- Not relevant
5. The size of the class, and
	- Likely that a fiduciary power cannot be struct down for being administratively unworkable.
6. How sensible the settlor's or testator's intent was (the test of capriciousness).
	- Can be invalidated for capriciousness.
	- But Virgo thinks this is silly.

### Resolving Uncertainty

Several methods:

#### Trustees as Arbiter

- Involves giving the trustees an express power to resolve uncertainty relating to the identity of objects.
- But need to balance principle against excessive delegation to the trustee (e.g., can't delegate will-making powers), principle that it is not acceptable to exclude the jurisdiction of the court to determine whether the objects are certain and the principle that the settlor's/ testator's intention should be respected.
- General rule: recognising that trustees are able to be arbiters about questions of evidential certainty but not conceptual certainty (*Re Coxen*)
- But the trustees would need to act reasonably in the exercise of this discretion.
- Evidential: in [[Dundee General Hospitals Board of Management v Walker]] it was recognised that it was valid for a trust to state that whether or not a hospital had been taken over by the state could be determined by the trustees in their sole and absolute discretion.
- Conceptual: in [[Re Wright's Will Trusts]] it was held that a residuary gift to trustees to use in 'their absolute discretion for such people and institutions as they think might have helped me or my late husband' was void for conceptual uncertainty.
- Similarly, in [[Re Jones [1953] 1 Ch 125]], "social or other relationship" was considered conceptually uncertain meaning it could not be resolved by reliance on the trustee's opinion as to what this meant.
- In [[Re Leek [1969] 1 Ch 563]] it was recognised that a power in a discretionary trust to appoint anybody whom the trustee considered to have a 'moral claim' on the settlor meant that the trustees were the arbiters and could determine who had a moral claim. Initially this seems to make the trustees the arbiters of conceptual certainty, but it's subtle. A distinction needs to be drawn between a trust for those who have a moral claim on the settlor with those having a moral claim being determined by the trustees, and a trust for those whom the trustees **think** have a moral claim on the settlor. The first involves the trustees defining 'moral claim', which is not acceptable, whereas the second construction involves the objects being those whom the trustees think have a moral claim on the settlor, in which case the trustees are not the arbiters of whether the power applies but rather form an essential part of the definition of the power.
- This was adopted in [[Re Coates [1955] Ch 495]] in which it was recognised that a power given by the testator to his wife in his will to pay a small sum of money if she 'feels I have forgotten any of my friends' was not void for uncertainty, since the relevant concept was not 'friends I have forgotten' but 'those people whom my wife considers are friends I have forgotten'.

#### Third Party as Arbiter

It has been recognised that it is acceptable to resolve questions of evidential uncertainty relating to the identification of objects by referring the matter to a third party whom the settlor has made an arbiter of the matter.

In [[Re Tuck's Settlement Trusts [1978] Ch 49]] any uncertainty about whether a person was married to an 'approved wife of Jewish blood' could legitimately be resolved by referring the matter to the chief rabbi, as the settlement has authorised.

Lord Denning recognised that conceptual uncertainty could be resolved by a third party and did not consider that this would oust the jurisdiction of the court, since trustees can still apply to the court for directions as to whether the third party has misconducted themselves or come to an unreasonable decision.

There is a tricky balancing act between respecting the wishes of the settlor and ensuring that the supervisory jurisdiction of the court is not ousted.

The use of third parties as arbiters could also be analysed as considering the third party to be part of the definition of the class. So the definition of the class is 'those people whom the chief rabbi considers to be of Jewish faith'. The third party can be required to give explanation to the court as to the basis of reaching their decision, which the court can set aside if unreasonable.

### Absence of Certainty of Objects

If a settlor purports to declare a trust, and [[certainty of intention]] and subject matter is satisfied, but certainty of objects is not, then the express trust will be void. But what happens to the property transferred to the trustee? A logical solution is to conclude the trustee should hold the property on trust for the settlor. The settlor can demand the transfer of legal title from the settlor, and if the settlor so wishes, declare another trust, this time ensuring the objects are certain.

If the trust were a testamentary trust, the trustee would hold the property for the benefit of those entitled to the deceased's residuary estate.
