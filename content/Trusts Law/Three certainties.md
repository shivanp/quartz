# Three certainties

Certainty is an essential component of an express trust. Rights and obligations need to be certain to be enforceable.

In order to create a valid express trust, it is necessary to comply with the rules known as the three certainties. They are:

1. [[Certainty of intention]]
2. [[Certainty of objects]]
3. [[Certainty of subject matter]]
