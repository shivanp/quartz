## Assessment

- MCQs
- Substantive questions in BLP
	- If you can't read the accounts, can't even start to answer the question.

More profit → more cash on balance sheet, as well as more value owed to proprietor.

Balance sheet must balance about the balance line. Remember the balance sheet is a snapshot in time.

Profit costs – because a bill had an element as a profit element and a cost element. Then solicitors started referring to these as 'costs'. This just means fees.

Income: whatever is produced from the operation of your business model.

Expense: nature of the benefit coming back as a result of the money going out, allowing you to maintain earning capacity (think of it as oil on machinery). Short term benefit, used up quickly, e.g., software.

Assets tend to increase your earning capacity. Benefit tends to be spread over a long time.

Long-term liability means more than a year.

R&D is an expense. If you misclassify it as an asset: goes up loads. If you then get a patent: becomes an asset.

Assets less outside liabilities = liabilities of business to owner.  
Net Assets = Capital Account

### Accruals Basis for Final Accounts

Doesn't have to be Jan-Dec, though this is the norm.

Must be produced on the accruals' basis; only items in accounts that truly relate to the accounting year.

Work in progress goes into inventory.

Software is an expense, but the benefit may be spread over multiple accounting periods. So here you just pro rata it. Put in pre-payment as a current asset.

Accrual means the obligation to pay has arisen. Show that there is an obligation to pay £100 in current liabilities.

Accrual means you used electricity this year which you pay for next year.
