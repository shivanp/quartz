# SRA Accounts Rules 2019

```toc
```

Law firms frequently hold money belonging to others. SRA imposes strict rules on dealing with clients' money. In June 2017 these were greatly simplified from the complicated Accounts Rules 2011.

## Principles

Designed to reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of client money. The 7 pervasive Principles apply to the regulation of accounts.

## Who is Bound

> [!statute] r 1 SRA Accounts Rules 2019
> 1. These rules apply to authorised bodies, their managers and employees and references to "you" in these rules should be read accordingly
> 2. The authorised body's managers are jointly and severally responsible for compliance by the authorised body, its managers and employees with these rules.

## Client Money

r 4.1: client money should be kept separate from the money belonging to the firm.

> [!statute] r 2.1
> "Client money" is money held or received by you:
> - relating to regulated services delivered by you to a client;
> - on behalf of a third party in relation to regulated services delivered by you (such as money held as agent, stakeholder or held to the sender's order);
> - as a trustee or as the holder of a specified office or appointment, such as donee of a power of attorney, Court of Protection deputy or trustee of an occupational pension scheme;
> - in respect of your fees and any unpaid disbursements if held or received prior to delivery of a bill for the same.
> 

| Term          | Definition                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Costs         | Fees and disbursements                                       |
| Fees          | Your own charges or profit costs (including any VAT element) |
| Disbursements | Any costs or expenses paid or to be paid to a third party on behalf of the client or trust.                                                              |

A solicitor has a duty to clarify any ambiguity as to whom client money is held for ([[[Challinor and Others v Juliet Bellis & Co and Another [2013] EWHC 347 (Ch)]]]).

The effect of Rule 2.1(d) is that money received for all fees and future disbursements paid to the firm is considered client money unless and until billed. Such money is often referred to as money received ‘generally on account of costs’.

The definition of client money does not include money received for disbursements which have already been paid, so where money is received in reimbursement of such a payment, it is a receipt of business money by the firm.

> [!note] Workaround?
> A firm might wish to send a bill to a client for its anticipated future fees and disbursements with a view to paying the money received in payment of that bill into the firm’s business account, thus escaping the requirement that would apply under Rule 2.1 (d) to pay money received for unbilled fees and unpaid disbursements into the client bank account. Allowed, but there are reasons to be cautious about doing this. 

## Client Bank Account

A client bank account is one opened by the firm in the name of the firm, but used for client money. Rule 3.1 requires such an account to be at a bank or building society in England and Wales, and Rule 3.2 requires the account to include the word ‘client’ in its title to distinguish it from the firm’s own business accounts.

Adding client in the title means section 85(2) of the Solicitors Act 1974 applies. Provides that a bank does not have any recourse or right against money in a client bank account in respect of any liability of the solicitor to the bank.

Rule 3.3 prohibits the use of a client bank account to provide banking facilities to clients or third parties.

## Prohibition on Providing Banking Facilities

> [!statute] r 3.3
> You must not use a client account to provide banking facilities to clients or third parties. Payments into, and transfers or withdrawals from a client account must be in respect of the delivery by you of regulated services.

> [!conduct] Using a client account improperly
> As well as sanctions for breaching r 3.3, a solicitor could be in breach of SRA Principles by failing to act 
> - in a way that upholds the constitutional principle of the rule of law, and the proper
> administration of justice: Principle 1
> - in a way that upholds public trust and confidence in the solicitors’ profession and in
> legal services provided by authorised persons: Principle 2
> - with independence: Principle 3
> - with integrity: Principle 5.

### SRA Warning

> Law firms, their managers and employees should not allow the firm’s client account to be used to provide banking facilities to clients or third parties. You must also actively consider whether there are any risk factors suggesting that the transaction on which you are acting, even if it appears to be the normal work of a solicitor, is not genuine or is suspicious.  
> SRA warning notice 25/11/19

Funds can only be received into the client bank account where there is a proper connection between receipt of the funds and the delivery of regulated services.

Simply having a retainer with a client is insufficient to allow for processing funds freely through the client bank account.

Note that traditionally, solicitors held funds for clients to enable them to pay routine outgoings. This is no longer acceptable practice.

> [!action]
> You should always ask why you are being asked to make a payment or why the client cannot make or receive the payment directly themselves. The client’s convenience is not a legitimate reason, nor is not having access to a bank account in the UK.

See [[Fuglers & Others v SRA [2014] EWHC 179 (Admin)]]; [[Premji Naram Patel v SRA [2012] EWHC 3373 (Admin)]]; and [[Attorney General of Zambia v Meer Care & Desai [2008] EWCA Civ 1007]].

### Deputies

Solicitors acting as deputies who used client bank accounts for the affairs of people without capacity to manage their own financial affairs under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 do not infringe r 3.3. But this is not recommended/ authorised by the Office of the Public Guardian (mixing funds is never really a good idea, and having a separate bank account means you can have safeguards on authorisation).

## Paying Client Money into Client Bank Account

> [!statute] r 2.3
> You ensure that client money is paid promptly into a client account unless:
> - in relation to money falling within 2.1(c), to do so would conflict with your obligations under rules or regulations relating to your specified office or appointment;
> - the client money represents payments received from the Legal Aid Agency for your costs; or
> - you agree in the individual circumstances an alternative arrangement in writing with the client, or the third party, for whom the money is held.
> 

This is subject to an exception:

> [!statute] r 2.2
> In circumstances where the only client money you hold or receive falls within rule 2.1(d) above, and:
> - any money held for disbursements relates to costs or expenses incurred by you on behalf of your client and for which you are liable; and
> - you do not for any other reason maintain a client account;
> 
> you are not required to hold this money in a client account if you have informed your client in advance of where and how the money will be held. Rules 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 7, 8.1(b) and (c) and 12 do not apply to client money held outside of a client account in accordance with this rule.

The ability to dispense with a client bank account can lead to cost savings in professional indemnity insurance, compliance and producing an accountant's report.

- Client money must be available on demand (r 2.4)
- Client money must be returned promptly once there is no reason to hold the funds (r 2.5)

## Keeping Money Separate

> [!statute] r 4.1
> You keep client money separate from money belonging to the authorised body.

### Mixed Receipts

If a firm receives a mixed payment containing client money + money to pay a firm's bill, the 2019 Rules allow the firm to choose whether to pay the receipt into the client or business bank account. This is a controversial change. Note that you still can't use client money to prop up business accounts because this would be contrary to the Principles.

### Client → Business Account Transfers

> [!statute] r 4.3
> Where you are holding client money and some or all of that money will be used to pay your costs:
> - you must give a bill of costs, or other written notification of the costs incurred, to the client or the paying party;
> - this must be done before you transfer any client money from a client account to make the payment; and
> - any such payment must be for the specific sum identified in the bill of costs, or other written notification of the costs incurred, and covered by the amount held for the particular client or third party.
> 

 Exception: where a bill includes anticipated disbursements which have not yet been incurred, not in breach of r 43 for leaving the money associated with those billed anticipated disbursements in the client bank account until they are paid.

### Bill for Anticipated fees/ Disbursements

2019 Rules permit monies to be transferred from client bank account if a bill has been given to the client for work to be undertaken in the future.

But consider the risk of insolvency and immediacy with which money could be paid back. You should not bill in advance for advance disbursements that the client will remain liable to pay for such as SDLT.

### Transferring Money for Paid Disbursements

- The obligation to send or give a bill to the client prior to transferring sums from the client bank account applies to the firms “costs”
	- This includes profit costs and disbursements
	- Change from the previous regime, which was just profit costs (“fees”)
- What about disbursements paid using firm money on behalf of the client?
	- SRA guidance states that r 5 permits money to be withdrawn from the client bank account “for the purpose for which it is being held”, provided that this has been made clear in writing.
	- But r 5 does not permit a transfer where disbursements have not yet been incurred.

## Withdrawals From Client Bank Account

### Circumstances

> [!statute] r 5.1
> You only withdraw client money from a client account:
> - for the purpose for which it is being held;
> - following receipt of instructions from the client, or the third party for whom the money is held; or
> - on the SRA's prior written authorisation or in prescribed circumstances.
> 

> [!statute] r 5.2
> You appropriately authorise and supervise all withdrawals made from a client account.

> [!statute] r 5.3
> You only withdraw client money from a client account if sufficient funds are held on behalf of that specific client or third party to make the payment.

If there are insufficient funds:

- Pay from business bank account, or
- Firm advances money to client bank account

### Residual Client Account Balances

Residual client account balance arises where money was not returned to the client at the end of a retainer and cannot be returned as the client cannot be identified/ traced.

- Residual client balances of $<£500$ can be withdrawn provided the balance is paid to a charity and reasonable steps have been taken to return the money to the rightful owner.
- For amounts over £500, contact the SRA for authority to remove the money from the client account.

### Client Accounting Systems

Firms must maintain accurate records:

> [!statute] r 8.1
> You keep and maintain accurate, contemporaneous, and chronological records to:
> - (a) record in client ledgers identified by the client's name and an appropriate description of the matter to which they relate:
> 	- (i) all receipts and payments which are client money on the client side of the client ledger account;
> 	- (ii) all receipts and payments which are not client money and bills of costs including transactions through the authorised body's accounts on the business side of the client ledger account;
> - (b) maintain a list of all the balances shown by the client ledger accounts of the liabilities to clients (and third parties), with a running total of the balances; and
> - (c) provide a cash book showing a running total of all transactions through client accounts held or operated by you.

| Rule  | Summary                                                                     |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| r 8.2 | Firms obtain bank statements for all client accounts at least every 5 weeks |
| r 8.3 | Bank reconciliation statements produced                                     |
| r 8.4 | Central record of bills and costs kept in a readily accessible form.                                                                            |

### Paying Interest to Clients

> [!statute] r 7.1
> You account to clients or third parties for a fair sum of interest on any client money held by you on their behalf.

This can be varied by written agreement, provided sufficient information is given for the client to give informed consent (r 7.2)

### 3rd Party Managed Accounts

> [!statute] r 11.1
> You may enter into arrangements with a client to use a third party managed account for the purpose of receiving payments from or on behalf of, or making payments to or on behalf of, the client in respect of regulated services delivered by you to the client, only if:
> - (a) use of the account does not result in you receiving or holding the client's money; and
> - (b) you take reasonable steps to ensure, before accepting instructions, that the client is informed of and understands:
> 	- (i) the terms of the contractual arrangements relating to the use of the third party managed account, and in particular how any fees for use of the third party managed account will be paid and who will bear them; and
> 	- (ii) the client's right to terminate the agreement and dispute payment requests made by you.

Obtain regular statements from the third party (r 11.2). Provisions in the Accounts Rules relating to holding client money do not apply to monies in a TPMA (third-party managed account). Regulation will be by the FCA. Firms using a TPMA must notify the SRA using a form.

## Other client/ TP Money

- Firms may open a joint account with client/ TP. The rules do not apply to such an account, other than r 8.2 (bank statements) and r 8.4 (keeping a central record).
- If the firm operates the client's bank account as a signatory, r 8.3 applies, requiring reconciliations of the account at least every 5 weeks.

## Accountants' Reports

> [!statute] r 12.1
> If you have, at any time during an accounting period, held or received client money, or operated a joint account or a client's own account as signatory, you must:
> 
> - (a) obtain an accountant's report for that accounting period within six months of the end of the period; and
> - (b) deliver it to the SRA within six months of the end of the accounting period if the accountant's report is qualified to show a failure to comply with these rules, such that money belonging to clients or thid parties is, or has been, or is likely to be placed, at risk.

These must be prepared and signed by a chartered account and is/ works for a registered auditor.

> [!statute] r 12.2
> You are not required to obtain an accountant's report if:
> 
> - (a) all of the client money held or received during an accounting period is money received from the Legal Aid Agency; or
> - (b) in the accounting period, the statement or passbook balance of client money you have held or received does not exceed:
> 	- (i) an average of £10,000; and
> 	- (ii) a maximum of £250,000,
> - (c) or the equivalent in foreign currency.
