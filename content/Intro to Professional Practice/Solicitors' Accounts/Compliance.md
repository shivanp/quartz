## Accountants' Reports

```ad-statute
title: r 12.1
If you have, at any time during an accounting period, held or received client money, or operated a joint account or a client's own account as signatory, you must:

- (a) obtain an accountant's report for that accounting period within six months of the end of the period; and
- (b) deliver it to the SRA within six months of the end of the accounting period if the accountant's report is qualified to show a failure to comply with these rules, such that money belonging to clients or third parties is, or has been, or is likely to be placed, at risk.

```

The obligation to send qualified reports rests with the firm and its managers. “Qualified” is not defined, but some examples of serious and moderate factors are given. Serious factors include a significant shortfall on client account, systematic billing for fees that have not occurred, disregard for the safety of client money,…

```ad-statute
title: r 12.2
You are not required to obtain an accountant's report if:

- (a) all of the client money held or received during an accounting period is money received from the Legal Aid Agency; or

	- (i) an average of £10,000; and
	- (ii) a maximum of £250,000,
- or the equivalent in foreign currency.
