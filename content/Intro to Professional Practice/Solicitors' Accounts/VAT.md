| Element            | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supply of goods    | All forms of supply whereby the whole property in goods is transferred, including a gift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Supply of services | Anything which is not a supply of goods but is done for consideration. The gratuitous supply of services is not a supply for VAT purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Taxable supply     | Any supply of goods or services other than an exempt supply. Exempt supplies listed in Sch 9 VATA 1994 (including most supplies of land, insurance, postal services, finance health, burial, cremation). Zero-rated supplies listed in Sch 8 VATA 1994 (food, water, books, transport). A reduced rate of 5% applies to some products, like domestic fuel. Legal services are standard rated. |
| Taxable person     | A person who is or is required to be registered under the Act. Value of taxable supplies in 12 months must exceed £85,000. Voluntary registration is always permitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Business           | Includes any trade, profession, or vocation, as well as provisions by some clubs/ associations. Where a person in the course of business accepts any office, any service supplied by them as holder of the office shall be treated as supplied in the course of business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

```ad-example
If a law firm is selling off old office equipment, the sales also attract VAT. 
```

### Input Tax

If a taxable person is charged VAT on the supply of goods services for the purposes of their business, they may deduct the tax charged to them from the amount of output tax which they account for to HMRC (s 25(2) VATA 1994).

```ad-question
title: What is a taxable person makes both taxable and exempt supplies?
They are partly exempt and may recover a proportion of input tax charged to them. Exception: when exempt supplies fall within de miimus limits, they can be ignored. 
```

### Value of Supply

Where a supply is fully taxable, standard rate VAT (20%) is payable on the value of the supply.

$$
\text{Value of supply} = \text{Consideration} - \text{Tax payable}
$$

A quoted price is deemed to be inclusive of VAT unless otherwise expressly stated.

### Time of Supply

VAT is payable quarterly. So the time of supply (“tax point”) determines the quarter in which a taxable person can claim input tax on a taxable supply and are liable to output tax.

| Supply   | Basic tax point                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goods    | When the goods are removed or made available to the purchaser (s 6(2)) |
| Services | When the services are completed (s 6(3)).                                                                        |

Variations:

- If within 14 days of the basic tax point, the supplier issues a tax invoice, the date of the invoice becomes the tax point, subject to any agreement with HMRC (ss 6(5) & (6))
- For solicitors, the 14 days is extended to 3 months
- If, before a basic tax point arises, the supplier issues a tax invoice or receives payment, the supply will be treated as taking place at the date of the invoice or payment (s 6(4)).

### Tax Invoices

A taxable person making a taxable supply to another taxable person must within 30 days of the time of supply (subject to extensions agreed with HMRC) provide them with a tax invoice. The tax invoice must contain various details.

### Collection and Accounts

Within a month of the end of each quarter, a taxable person must submit a completed return form to HMRC together with a tax remittance. The amount payable is obtained from a statutory VAT account.

## Law Firms

Firms providing legal services must charge VAT.

### Disbursements

Disbursements are not regarded by HMRC as part of the supply of legal services, so the firm does **not** have to charge VAT on them. To qualify as a disbursement, all the following conditions must be met (para 25.1.1 VAT Notice 700):

1. you acted as the agent of your client when you paid the third party;
2. your client actually received and used the goods or services provided by the third party (this condition usually prevents the agent’s own travelling and subsistence expenses, telephone bills, postage, and other costs being treated as disbursements for VAT purposes);
3. your client was responsible for paying the third party (examples include estate duty and stamp duty payable by your client on a contract to be made by the client);
4. your client authorised you to make the payment on their behalf;
5. your client knew that the goods or services you paid for would be provided by a third party;
6. your outlay will be separately itemised when you invoice your client; you recover only the exact amount which you paid to the third party; and
7. the goods or services, which you paid for, are clearly additional to the supplies which you make to your client on your own account.

The principle behind this is that there is a distinction between [[Nell Gwynn House Maintenance Fund Trustees v C&E Commissioners [1999] STC 79]]:

- Expenses paid to a 3rd party incurred in the course of making your own supply of services to the client which are part of the whole of the services rendered to the client.
- Expenses for specific services that have been supplied by the 3rd party to your client, and you have acted as a client's known and authorised representative in paying the third party.

```ad-example
title: Disbursements
- IHT
- CGT
- Stampt duty
- Estate agents' fees
- Counsel's fees - even though the solicitor is responsible for ensuring payment. 
- Land Registry fees for registration of title
```

Broadly, these can be divided into the categories of statutory charges and charges for the professional services of a 3rd party.

### Not Disbursements

Items which are a necessary part of the service supplied to a client.

```ad-example
title: Not disbursements
- Telephone charges
- Postage and photocopying charges
- Travelling expenses incurred by solicitor ([[Rowe & Maw (A Firm) v Customs and Excise Commissioners [1975] 1 WLR 1291]])
- Electronic search fee ([[Brabners LLP v HMRC [2017] UKFTT 0666 (TC)]])
```

#### Search Fees

Whether a fee for a search is to be treated as a disbursement will depend on how information obtained in the search is used. If passed on to the client without comment or analysis, may be treated as a disbursement ([[Barratt, Goff and Tomlinson (a firm) v HMRC (Law Society Intervening) [2011] UKFTT 71 (TC)]]). But it is unusual for this to be the case. More commonly, the solicitor will prepare advice/ a report based on the search. Therefore, the search will be part of the overall service and subject to VAT.

The same item may amount to a disbursement in one situation, but not in another. Fees for Official Copy entries are unlikely to fulfil the criteria for a disbursement.

### Accounting Non-disbursements

Firms usually do not make a separate charge for overheads such as photocopying and phone calls. Possible to deal with search fees similarly.

- CR cash – business section
- DR searches account.
- DR HMRC account if applicable.

Firms will normally want a record of the searches incurred for each client, so that they are shown separately from professional charges. They should then record these on the client ledger.

- CR cash – business section
- DR client ledger – business section with VAT exclusive amount. Make a note the payment is part of the firm's taxable supply.
- DR HMRC account with the VAT input tax charged to the firm.

Where the original supplier charges VAT, the solicitor will treat the VAT as input tax. The VAT exclusive amount will be added to the supply and the solicitor will charge output tax.

### Accounting Disbursements

#### Non-taxable Disbursements

Paid out of the client bank account if there is sufficient money, else out of the business bank account. There are no VAT considerations.

#### Taxable Disbursements

Payment made by the firm will include a VAT element, which is passed onto the client. Clients who are registered for VAT will want to recover this from HMRC, so need a VAT invoice addressed to them. But the supplier may have addressed the invoice to the firm making the payment.

If addressed to the client, the agency method is used. If addressed to the firm, the principal method is used, requiring the solicitor to resupply the service to the client.

#### Agency Method

The firm acts as the agent. Payment made using client bank account if sufficient credit, else business bank account. Only the total amount paid needs to be recorded. The firm then sends the supplier's tax invoice to the client.

#### Principal Method

If the invoice is addressed to the firm, the supply is treated as made to the firm.

- Firm claims supply as input
- Firm uses business money to pay supplier fees + input tax
- Firm resupplies the item to the client at the same price.
- Firm charges client output tax on the firm's professional charges, and the disbursement
- Firm provides 1 invoice to cover the above.

```ad-warning
A disbursement paid on the principal method must be paid out of the business bank account, even if there is client money available. Supply is treated as being made to the firm, not the client. 
```

### Counsel Fees

Counsel fees usually addressed to the firm and would have to be treated on the principal basis. But HMRC has agreed a concession. The firm is allowed to alter the fee note so that it is dressed to the client. It is then treated on the agency basis. The firm must give the fee note to the client. The firm should keep a copy of the amended receipted fee note for assessment of costs purposes.
