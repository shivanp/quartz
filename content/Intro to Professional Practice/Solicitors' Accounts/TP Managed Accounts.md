```toc
```

## Rules

```ad-statute
title: r 11.1 Accounts' Rules
You may enter into arrangements with a client to use a third party managed account for the purpose of receiving payments from or on behalf of, or making payments to or on behalf of, the client in respect of regulated services delivered by you to the client, only if:
- (a) use of the account does not result in you receiving or holding the client's money; and
- (b) you take reasonable steps to ensure, before accepting instructions, that the client is informed of and understands:
	- (i) the terms of the contractual arrangements relating to the use of the third party managed account, and in particular how any fees for use of the third party managed account will be paid and who will bear them; and
	- (ii) the client's right to terminate the agreement and dispute payment requests made by you.
```

```ad-statute
title: r 11.2
You obtain regular statements from the provider of the third party managed account and ensure that these accurately reflect all transactions on the account.
```

To protect client money and assets (para 4.2 SRA Code for Solicitors) and to act in the best interests of each client (Principle 7), a solicitor must ensure that a decision to use a TPMA is appropriate in each individual case.

## Checks

- The TPMA must be authorised and regulated by the FCA. This means it must be:
	- An authorised payment institution
	- A small payment institution which has adopted voluntary safeguarding arrangements to the same level as an API
	- An EEA authorised payment institution.
- TPMA must be an account held at a bank or building society operated as an escrow payment service.

## Engaging Client

Firm must take appropriate steps to ensure that:

- Client is informed and understands their rights and obligations. Also whether they are required to authorise payments and any fees they may have to pay.
- Obtains regular statements and ensure these reflect the transactions on the account correctly.
- Makes sure funds in the TPMA are only used for the designated purpose.
- Keep overview records of transactions.

Para 2.1 Code for Firms; the firm must have in place effective systems and controls to ensure that the business and employees comply with SRA regulatory arrangements. SRA should be notified that a firm is using a TPMA, using a TPMA form.

## Tell Clients

- How the money will be held and how the transaction will work (paragraph 8.6 of the SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors, RELs and RFLs)
- their right to terminate the agreement (rule 11.1(b)(ii) of the accounts rules)
- their right to dispute payment requests made by you
- who will be responsible for costs associated with the agreement (rule 11.1(b)(i) of the Accounts Rules)
- that the TPMA is regulated by the FCA and that complaints about the TPMA provider should be made to that provider in accordance with their complaints procedure, and
- that the regulatory protections that apply to TPMAs are different to those that apply to client money held in a firmâ€™s client account (paragraph 8.11 of the SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors, RELs and RFLs).
