# Accounting Problems

```toc
```

One problem is that a large number of client ledgers are required, with frequent inter-client transactions.

## Stakeholder Money

May receive a deposit to hold as stakeholder. This is a receipt of client money, so must be held in the client bank account. This is held jointly for the buyer and seller. It will not become the property of the seller unless and until completion.

> [!guid] Law Society guidance
> Stakeholder money may be shown on the seller's ledger but must be clearly labelled as stakeholder money held for both buyer and seller. 

Alternatively, use a separate stakeholder ledger. If a separate stakeholder ledger is used, once monies received from the buyer:

- DR cash
- CR Joint stakeholder ledger.

Then on completion:

- DR joint stakeholder ledger
- CR seller's ledger

## Bridging Finance

A deposit received as stakeholder is not available to the seller until completion (subject to agreement to the contrary – Standard Conditions SC 2.2.5). Often a bridging loan is obtained from a bank to cover the period from exchange of contracts to completion of the sale. This is a personal loan to the borrower. So, when received, credited to the borrower's ledger account.

## Mortgages

A client who sells property subject to a mortgage will have to redeem the mortgage after completion. If you act for a client buying a property, may also act for the lender, provided there is no conflict of interest.

- Mortgage advance received from a lender is usually held for the lender until the day of completion
- r 8.1: receipts and payments of client money must be recorded on client ledgers identified by the client's name and description.
- Firms acting for both the lender and borrower can choose to either:
	1. Credit the mortgage advance to the borrower's ledger account. Details column should include the name of the lender and “mortgage advance”
	2. Mortgage advance credited to a separate ledger account in the name of the lender on receipt. On completion, perform an inter-client audit trail.

### Professional Charges

Entitled to charge the lender for work done in connection with the mortgage advance and charge the buyer for work done in connection with the purchase. The buyer may have agreed with the lender to pay the costs charged to the lender.

Normal rule: costs and VAT must be debited to the ledger account of the person to whom legal services were supplied.

### Mortgage Redemption

Many sellers have a balance left on their mortgage at the date of sale. The balance must be paid off from the proceeds of sale.

If acting for both the lender and seller (rare but possible), some sale proceeds will be received for the seller and some for the lender. The whole receipt of client money will be paid into the client bank account. Just make sure there is a clear audit trail.

Options:

1. Credit the whole amount to the seller's ledger account initially, and then do an immediate inter-client transfer of the amount required to redeem the mortgage.
2. Split the credit entries at the time of receipt. Credit part of the proceeds to the seller's ledger account and part to the lender's ledger account. Debit entire amount to cash account client section.

### Legal Fees on Mortgage Redemption

The seller may have agreed to pay the lender's legal fees, in which case a transfer should be made.

## Agency Transactions

A firm may decide to use another firm as its agent. This frequently happens in litigation.

### Agency Firm

Treats the instructing firm like any other client.

### Instructing Firm

Professional fees charged by the agent are not a disbursement paid by the instructing firm on behalf of the client. The professional fees of the agent are an expense of the instructing firm. The firm will charge enough for its legal services to cover the expense of using an agent. Any true disbursements will be charged to the client as usual.

When paying an agent's bill, send one business bank account cheque for the total amount. 3 elements:

1. Agent's professional fees (DR agency expenses account, business section)
2. VAT on these fees (DR HMRC account, business section)
3. Any disbursements paid by the agent (DR client account ledger, business section)

Record these on the separate relevant accounts.
