# Professional Conduct and Regulation 1

The solicitors' regulator is the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). They publish Standards and Regulations, including:

- SRA Principles
- SRA Code of Conduct
- RELs
- RFLs
- SRA Code of Conduct for Firms

These are based on ethics and stuff. The SRA enforces Principles and Codes and can impose disciplinary action if there is a breach.

## Lecture

Clients must be able to trust solicitors. Must act professionally. Must be aware of legal and regulatory obligations. Note this will be examined at the end of the LPC in a stand-alone exam.

### Bodies Regulating Solicitors

- SRA
	- Has the power to investigate firms and impose fines
- Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal
	- Can impose unlimited fines or strike off a solicitor
	- Investigates the conduct of individual solicitors.
- Legal Ombudsman
	- Public facing

Solicitors are subject to the general law. Most importantly, to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Breaching these is usually a criminal offence.

### SRA

To be admitted as a solicitor, must meet SRA requirements for fitness of character. Need practising certificates. SRA also sets out accounting rules.

#### SRA Principles

High level requirements:

1. Rule of law and administration of justice
2. Confidence in the profession
3. Independence
4. Honesty
5. Integrity
6. Equality, diversity and inclusion
7. Client's best interests (fiduciary position, common law, need to do what is best for the client even above their own interest).

#### SRA Codes

A framework of competent and ethical practice. Individual expected to exercise good judgment. There is

- SRA CoC for Solicitors
- SRA CoC for Firms

These are overlapping but different. Key requirements:

- Client care and complaints
	- Client must be able to make informed decisions
	- Client must be told how matter will be priced and the overall cost
	- Right to complain - to be dealt with promptly, fairly and for free
- Confidentiality and disclosure
	- Fundamental part of solicitor-client relationship
	- Duty to keep affairs of former and current clients confidential
	- But also duty to make client aware of all information material to the matter of which you have knowledge
	- What about when the two above clash? Then the solicitor could not continue to act for both clients. Maybe have two clients represented by different solicitors in the same firm.
- Conflict of interest
	- Own interest conflict: absolute bar on acting
	- Client conflict: usually cannot act for both clients, though there are some exceptions
	- A lot of the time there is the *potential* for conflict, even if there is no current conflict.

### Financial Services Regulation

Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FiSMA)

- Financial services can only be provided by authorised firms (think crypto and FCA)
- Solicitors can stray into the realm of specialist financial advisor if they are not careful. Fine line between saying whether a business is a good investment, and doing due diligence. Similarly, advising on financials vs making something tax efficient.

Similarly, must be careful about straying into 'regulated activities'.

- Rules apply when we are 'in business'
- Specified investments – does not include land or national savings products, but does include stocks etc.
- Specified activities (like managing a portfolio of investments)
- Exclusions
	- Referring client to an authorised third person like a stockbroker
	- s 327 exemption; allows solicitors to carry out regulated activities! But lots of procedures and stuff which must be followed.

### Money Laundering

Legislation exists. Two aspects:

- Due diligence regulations
- Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 – money laundering offences.

s 328 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002: a person commits an offence if he enters a transaction he suspects is money laundering. This is very widely drafted. So the solicitor should report suspicions with the money laundering officer at the firm, who will then liaise with the national crime agency if needed.
