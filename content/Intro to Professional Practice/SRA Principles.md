# SRA Principles

## Introduction

The profession is regulated by the Government, the FCA and the SRA. The SRA Principles are all-pervasive and underpin all the SRA's regulatory arrangements.

The Principles are mandatory and aply to all individuals and bodies regulated by the SRA. They apply outside of a solicitor's practice as well as within it.

## 1. Justice and the Rule of Law

Principle 1 provides that a soolicitor must act in a way that upholds the constitutional rule of law and proper administration of justice.

## 2. Public Trust

A solicitor must act in a way that upholds public trust and confidence in the solicitors' profession and in legal services. A solicitor may breach Principle 2 through behaviour outside their solicitors' practice (e.g., getting a criminal conviction).

## 3. Independence

A solicitor must act with independence. This includes indepedence from the client - need to be mindful of their wider obligations to the profession as a whole.

## 4. Honesty

Where a solicitor is convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, likely that they will be struck off the roll of solicitors. The standard of honesty required for solicitors is that they may be 'trusted to the ends of the earth' ([[Bolton v Law Society [1993] EWCA Civ 32]]).

## 5. Integrity

A solicitor must act with integrity; they are in a position of trust. The concept of integrity is wider than just dishonesty - refers to the higher standards which society expects of a professional.

## 6. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion

Solicitors and firms must act in a way that encourages equality, diversity and inclusion.

> [!example]
> - Making reasonable adjustments for disabled clients
> - Treating employees fairly
> - Having processes in place to deal with bullying, harassment and discrimination.

## 7. Best Interests of the Client

A solicitor must act in the best interests of each client. Derives from the common law and the fiduciary relationship.

This includes ensuring clients are provided with a proper standard of service in terms of client care, competence and standard of work.
