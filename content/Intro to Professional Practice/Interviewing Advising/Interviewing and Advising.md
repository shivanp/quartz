# Interviewing and Advising

## Importance of Interview Skills

- Building good relationships and reputations
	- Significant amount of time spent interviewing clients and witnesses
	- Make a good impression at an initial interview
- Law Society guidance says it's important

## Objectives of solicitor/ Client Interview

5 main objectives:

- To establish good rapport between the solicitor and client
- To obtain relevant information from the client
- To help the client reach appropriate decisions
- To plan future action
- To deal with client care and costs information issues.

## Skills

Skills involved are:

- Listening
	- Encourage client to explain, so avoid asking closed questions to start with.
	- Only interrupt if they don't stop talking.
	- Use silence to give client time to recall facts and organise thoughts
	- Eye contact
	- Posture
	- Head nodding
	- Acknowledgements
	- Invitations to continue/ elaborate
	- Reflecting feeling ("I can see why you feel so angry about this")
- Questioning
	- Need to know: nature of problem, background facts, client's feelings and objectives
	- Probe through questioning
	- Ask open questions – various benefits of this.
	- But also closed questions - obvs advantages and disadvantages
	- T-funnel from open to closed questions.
- Analysing
	- Analyse which facts and principles are relevant, how the law applies, and reach a conclusion about possible courses of action.
	- You have to ascertain the facts yourself, and no time to reflect.
- Explaining
	- Ensure client understands the legal position and legal process
	- Don't use terminology which can be daunting – clarity is vital.
	- Outline relevant procedure
		- And also potential problems
		- Managing client expectations makes them feel more closely involved in the matter
		- Try to send a follow p letter summarising the advice
		- Offer to repeat the advice (but don't be patronising).
- Note-taking
	- File must contain a complete, accurate and legible record of the interview.
	- Do not attempt to take notes during the initial stage, and then take lots of notes in the 'filling details stage'. Ok to have to ask the client to repeat something.
	- Always take down key details super precisely and use headers.

### Probing

Some probing techniques are:

- Going back one stage ('take me through that again')
- Leading questions ('so you've had disagreements with the manager before?')
- Prefacing a question with an explanation.
	- Makes things less out of the blue
	- But be careful not to prejudice response.
- Cross-checking
	- 'are you sure because xyz'
- Devil's advocate
	- Preface with 'Sorry to ask you bluntly, but it's a question you will defo be asked at trial'

### Summarising

Gives client an opportunity to correct errors and supply additional facts. Useful breathing space here.

## Structure

Structure and management include:

- Creating a suitable environment for the interview
- Preparing adequately for the interview
- Using an appropriate model for the interview.
	- Pre-determined structure for the interview

### Model

General model:

1. Plan
	1. Organise a room
	2. Carry out conflict check
	3. Ensure client has been warned to bring proof of identity
	4. Prepare checklist if appropriate
	5. 2 copies of client care information sheet
	6. Ensure no interruptions
2. Greeting
	1. Meet, greet and seat
3. Preliminaries
	1. Check reason for visit with a closed question
	2. Discuss time constraints and proposed interview structure
	3. Explain cost of interview, say you will deal more fully w costs later, and check they accept
4. Obtaining facts
	1. Client giving an account of the matter with v little interruption.
5. Filling in detail
	1. More active role by solicitor. Lots of questioning and taking notes.
	2. Summarise to end
6. Advising
	1. Supplying the information which the client needs to make necessary decisions. Involves analysing and explaining client's position and engaging in a dialogue.
	2. Outline relevant law and procedure
	3. Explain available options, both legal and non-legal.
	4. Dis/advantages of each option
	5. Next practical steps
7. Closing
	1. Ask if anything else
	2. Confirm follow-up tasks
	3. Give name of an alternative contact in the firm
	4. Estimate time frame and cost of matter
	5. Next steps
8. Parting
	1. Maintain rapport
	2. Appropriate structure
	3. Manage client expectations.

## Client Care and Costs

Must deal with a client professionally. Information about costs must be accurate and upfront – sensible to give a simple overview during the interview and full written information after.

### Client Care Information Sheet

Get the client to sign and date a document informing them of costs, ways to complain, regulatory protections, etc.

## Structure and Management

Make sure the interview environment is conducive to a good interview. Want a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Take into account disabilities. Office should look like well-organised professionalism.

Sit at opposite sides of a solicitor's desk generally.

## Preparing

Recall para 6 SRA Code for Solicitors: should not act where there is a conflict of interest or significant risk of conflict of interest with a current client.

For a transactional deal, checking conflicts of interest can be quite complicated; like if you are trying to act for multiple sellers of a company.

Must identify the person for whom you act – is it the director or company. Where applicable under Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017, a new client should be warned that the firm will need evidence of their identity.

## Research

Research client case history and background information where possible. Also any bits of law, depending on what the client says when booking the interview.

Maybe make a checklist before the interview, but do so in a way which does not damage rapport. So give client time to speak and express themselves before jumping to this. Use an interpreter if needed. If using a sign language interpreter, make sure to video.

## Preliminaries

Ask the client to clarify exactly why they are visiting before encouraging them to tell you all about it.

Let the client how long you are available for and ask if they have any time constraints.

Find out if the client is paying the costs of the interview themselves, or if someone else is (e.g., company, trade union). Tell the client how much the initial interview will be, and then check whether the client is genuinely content to accept the arrangement.

Use only closed questions at this stage.

> [!question] Why **ought** trainee solicitors to disclose their trainee status to clients?
> 
> It is certainly polite to introduce yourself fully.   The SRA Code of Conduct for Individuals does not say anything specific about disclosing name and status. However you must not mislead the client (Para 1.4) and you must ensure that clients are in a position to make informed decisions about the services they need, how their matter will be handled and the options available to them (Para 8.6). Clearly clients must be given the opportunity to consider whether they are happy with the level of experience of the fee earner advising them.  
> 
> However, if you delayed giving this information until after the initial interview, a client who was not happy to be dealing with a trainee would be justifiably annoyed. It is therefore important that you tell the client this during the interview,  record the fact in the attendance note and include it in your follow-up letter to the client after the interview.

## Obtaining the Facts

- It might take some time for trust to build up.
- Think very carefully about the initial question you ask.
- Question logically

## Filling in Detail

If you need time to read documents, just say this, so there is a comfortable silence.

## Advising

Be very clear about:

- Relevant issues, likely complications
- Available options
- Whether possible options merit the risk and expense
- Your role and responsibilities and the services which firm can/ cannot provide.

### Explain Legal Position

If the matter is not straightforward or you are a trainee, completely fine to postpone advice until you have carried out research/ taken advice from solicitor. Clients don't necessarily expect/ need immediate advice.

Definitely emphasise complications and possible solutions.

Take into account non-legal factors: litigation can be emotionally stressful and time consuming. Clearly explain the pros and cons of each option. Client might need time to come to a considered decision.

Agree a more detailed plan of action:

- whether to approach the other side immediately or wait
- whether you or the client should make the first approach.
- 'can I just check you understand xyz'

## Closing

Always ask if there is anything else. "Before I start to round off this meeting, can I just check that there is nothing else that you want to bring up or ask me about?"

Ask what address the client wants correspondence to be forwarded to. Give an alternative contact.

Talk about next steps explicitly. Give a time frame for the matter. Estimate costs – maybe offer a conditional fee. Will be an agreed fee or an estimation of the likely costs. Make it clear this is only a rough guide. Consider a ceiling on costs, or reassuring that you'll keep them regularly updated. As well as giving an hourly rate, give at least an estimate of how many hours it should take. "It may well be over £1000"

Mention any disbursements (if you have to hire a barrister and then charge the client for it, stuff like that). Make it clear where you will make next contact.

## Parting

Accompany client back to reception area. End professionally. Produce a fully written record as soon as possible. Send the follow-up letter in good time after the interview. Letter should contain costs information, opportunity to deal with client care issues, and copy of firm's terms of business.

Practise this skill lots and you will get better!!
