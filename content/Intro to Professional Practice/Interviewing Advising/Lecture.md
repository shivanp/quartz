Practice assessment Aug-Sep.  
Pass/fail  
Allowed 2 sides of A4 notes

Interviewing assessed in the context of company law. Provided with bulletin saying what topics will come up. One of these topics will come up. So basically do loads of prep and this will be fine.

May include company procedure. Note this is covered extensively in BLP. For the practice interview, still business law.

## Advice

Intro:

- Use the client's surname
- External examiner thinks that students can be too informal
- Remember this is the first time you've met the client
- “Hello, I'm Shivan Parmar, trainee solicitor at xyz”.
- Know what firm you're 'working for' before you go in
- Don't want the client to launch into their open introduction.
- If you make this mistake, wait for them to draw breath.
- But closed question when checking reason for visit.
- “I've set aside 30 mins for this interview, in a moment I'll ask you for some more details of why you're here… How does that sound?”
- Try not to make it 5 mins long
- Explain the cost of interview. Remember to include VAT—quote firm's hourly rate plus VAT.
- Make sure not to give the idea that it is a fixed fee interview, unless it is.
- “The firm charges my time at £150 an hour plus VAT”
- “So the cost will be in the region of £75 + VAT, depending on how long the interview lasts for”
- "Ok would you like to tell me why you've come to see me today"
- Then relax!

## Obtain Facts

- Avoid taking notes
- Show you're listening
- Nod attentively
- It's fine to say “can you just tell me the name of the company again”
- Maintain good eye contact.
- Then, “if you don't mind, I'll now make some notes”

## Advising

You can take a few moments to make some notes, but be careful not to do this for too long. 30-45 seconds max. You must give your advice pretty instantaneously. Outline relevant law and procedure accurately and comprehensively. Don't use any technical jargon.

Prepare topics which are difficult to explain. Prepare multiple sheets, and select appropriate ones based on the task you get.

Keep options relevant. Do nothing is usually an option, but not always, if the client wants to actively do something.

Discuss advantages, disadvantages and implementations of the options.

## Closing

“So have I covered everything for you there? Is there anything else I can help you with?”

Follow-up tasks: e.g., drawing up a service agreement, reviewing a service agreement.

Always have a letter of advice to the client. What else does the client have to do? Talking to other people involved in the venture.

Alternative contact within the firm will be on the briefing sheet thing. Don't suggest the client will complain, "if I'm not available at any time, please contact my supervisor xyz".

Time frame: you're talking about what happens next.

- For negotiations: depends
- Forming a company: shouldn't take more than 4-6 weeks (with all the prep and advising and stuff)

Time-frame means for the matter, not your time.

THEN, deal with the costs of any future work.

Remind client of hourly rate. “Reviewing a service contract will take 2-3 hours, so the cost will be £150 + VAT”.

Talk about next meeting. “You'll go away and think about things, I'll contact you in a week or so to talk about a future meeting?". Or just arrange for next week.

“Thank you for making yourself available today, I think that's brought us to the end of the interview”.

Usually, interviews finish within 20 mins. If this happens, given a max of 5 mins to write up notes. So if interview lasts 27 mins, only get 3 mins to write up notes.

Deal with any conduct issues that arise. Shouldn't arise – but think about conflict of interest. Don't say, “why don't you bring in John, and I can talk to you all”. You are advising this client.

## Other Points

Assessment Bulletin: this is v important, make sure you read it carefully. There is also a workbook, practice with a friend.
