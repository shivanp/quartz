# The Legal Profession

## The Legal Profession

### Professional Conduct

- Being a professional, the public must be able to trust a solicitor.
- Must be trusted to act in best interests of the client
- Must comply with general regulatory requirements such as Bribery Act 2010. Mostly the onus on firms is to have adequate procedures in place to prevent bad stuff happening.
- SRA produced additional rules and regulations
	- Breaching these has severe consequences, including being struck off

### Legal Services Board

- Created by Legal Services Act 2007
- Supervises the 'approved regulators' of the legal profession, including the SRA (and the Bar Council etc.)

### SRA

Established by The Law Society in Jan 2007. Purpose is to protect the public by ensuring that solicitors meet high standards. Governed by a board of 11 members, 5 of which are solicitors. HQ in Birmingham. Budget funded by practising certificate fee.

### Law Society

Representative body for solicitors in England and Wales. Founded in 1825. Lobbies the government about changes in the law, lobbies for better working conditions for solicitors etc.

- Membership is optional.
- Governed by a Council
- There are 54 local law societies around the country

### Aspects of Practice

Different ways in which law can be practised::

- Sole practice
	- Becoming less common (Westlaw and stuff is hella expensive)
	- Practicality: going on holidays without having to hire a locum.
	- Authorised in the same way as other types of firm
- As a recognised body
	- Legal services body (75% of managers legally qualified & non-solicitor managers approved by SRA) can apply for authorisation by the SRA as a recognised body.
	- Recognised forms include:
		- Partnerships
			- Classic law firm structure: partners and then everyone else. Some large firms have salaried and equity partners.
		- Limited Liability Partnerships
			- Instead of partners, LLPs have members, who share in the profits.
		- Companies
			- Incorporate under Companies Act 2006
	- Once authorised, a body is entitled to carry on all 'reserved legal activities' (except notary services). This is defined in s 12 Legal Services Act 2007.
	- The recognised body must have a Compliance Officer for Legal Practice (COLP) and Compliance Officer for Finance and Administration (COFA) and whom the SRA has approved.
- As a Licensed Body
	- The Legal Services Act 2007 also introduced alternative business structures, allowing non-lawyers to offer legal services alongside non-legal services. Also allowed non-lawyers to own and invest in firms providing legal services.
	- Eligibility: must be one manager authorised by the SRA or another approved regular. Must also be a licensable body (confusing definition).
	- Once authorised, a licensed body is entitled to carry out the same range of activities as a recognised body.
	- Similarly as recognised bodies, must have a Head of Finance and Administration and Head of Legal Practice.

#### New Changes

New SRA Standards and Regulations 2019: solicitors allowed to deliver non-reserved legal activities to the public from within a business not regulated by a legal services regulator. So e.g., a big four accountancy firm could offer family/ employment law services without going through the full authorisation process, but would not be able to hold client money.

Further, individual solicitors can now work and offer legal services on a freelance basis. Will not have to maintain the same level of client protection usually required. Does not need to be authorised if:

1. Practice consists entirely of non-reserved activities, or
2. Any reserved legal activities are provided through an authorised body/ authorised non-SRA firm.

#### Employed Solicitors

This is a solicitor who is employed by a non-legal services employer (i.e., in-house counsel). Subject to same rules as lawyers in private practice.

#### Registered European Lawyers and Registered Foreign Lawyers

Foreign lawyers who want to become managers owners of law firms authorised by the SRA must become RFLs. RELs are no longer a thing after Brexit, apart from the Swiss until 2024. These classifications allow foreign lawyers to provide all unreserved legal services, and some reserved legal services.

#### Law Centres

There are 43 of them nationwide. Provide free legal advice to disadvantaged individuals within communities. Must take out appropriate indemnity insurance.

#### Legal Advice Centres

No casework is undertaken, but legal advice provided. ULaw and BPP run their own.

#### Duty Solicitor Schemes

Police station duty solicitor scheme aims to provide advice and assistance to people at police stations who would otherwise not be legally represented The court duty solicitor scheme aims to provide emergency legal representation at magistrates' courts on a rota basis. Fees for both cases are paid by the Legal Aid Agency to contracted solicitors.
