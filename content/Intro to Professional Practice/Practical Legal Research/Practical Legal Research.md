# Practical Legal Research

All chapter references are to Skills for Lawyers

## Ch 2: Introduction

Early in a legal career, a large proportion of time will be spent doing legal research. Research needs to be accurate, timely, up-to-date and concise.

### Problem-solving

Use the following model:

1. Identify the objective
	1. Circumstances prompting client to seek legal advice
	2. Remember what client wants
2. Gather relevant facts
	1. Continually review gaps in client's account
	2. Other sources: witnesses, statements, experts, other lawyers
3. Identify relevant law
	1. Series of legal issues will arise from these key facts
	2. Issues will be divided into substantive and procedural law
4. Apply law to facts
	1. Narrow the focus by applying the law to material facts
	2. Remember client's interest in the law is limited
5. Identify possible solutions
	1. Ensure no alternative is missed
	2. Brainstorm
	3. Consider the possibility of doing nothing
6. Consider advantages and disadvantages
	1. Weigh up rewards and risks
	2. Consider financial and emotional costs
	3. Ask senior lawyers if unsure
7. Advise on most appropriate solution(s)
	1. Be prepared to outline costs and benefits in detail, as well as risks and how to mitigate
8. Present solution(s) in appropriate form.
	1. Tailor report to recipient.

### Principles of Practical Legal Research

- Devise search terms carefully
	- Broaden your search terms to general legal terms (e.g., 'contract remedies', 'sale of goods')
	- Use synonyms ('employment' and 'labour')
- Knowing where to look
	- Start with a source giving a general overview of the law in a certain area
		- Halsbury's Laws of England good for this
	- Next look at primary sources
- Use indexes
	- Use subject indexes and indexes within a source.
	- CTRL-F searches tend to generate a lot of noise
- Record research trail
	- Allows you to go back to research you had previously completed, allows supervisor to check work, proof for client that you've actually done the work
- Update your information
	- Check the most likely developments on the law.
	- Do not assume online sources are fully up-to-date
	- Check if the source states a cut-off date
	- Read prefaces and stuff
	- Make methodical notes including full citations and references
- Presenting findings appropriately
	- Present in writing if possible
	- Put a summary of findings at the top
- Know when to stop and ask
	- If you have found answer/ get stuck, ask for help
	- Use librarians and their expertise

## Ch 3: Online Vs Printed Sources

Lawyers increasingly rely on Westlaw and Lexis Library for research. They allow quick searching and printing of results. But paper sources can be useful.

Suggested to start with a printed secondary source like Halsbury's Laws of England or a practitioner work, and then move on to an online database based on the index.

### Accessing Online Sources

Freely available sources include government websites and <www.bailii.org.> Two major subscription sources are Westlaw and LexisLibrary. Most journal and case reports appear in one or the other.

### Search Guidelines

Need to think about keywords likely to feature. Use features to narrow search, such as date range or level of court.

#### Truncation

A search for a truncated word will search for different word endings. On LexisLibrary, searching 'pollut!' returns pollute, pollutes, polluting and pollution etc.

#### Wild Card Characters

On Lexis, searching 'wom\*n' will return 'woman' and 'women'.

| Connector | Effect | Function |
|:----------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------- |
| and e.g., Donoghue and Stevenson | The computer will retrieve only those documents where both the first term and the second term appear | Narrows a search - to improve precision of results |
| or e.g., fence or boundary | The computer will retrieve all documents where the first term appears and also all documents where the second term appears | Expands a search - to search for possible synonyms, etc |
| not e.g., pollution not air | The computer will retrieve documents that contain the first term but do not contain the second term | Narrows a search -eliminates terms not relevant to your topic |

#### Field Searching

Most databases divide documents into a number of separate fields. So can confine your search term to the 'subject/keywords' field rather than a free text search.

#### Phrase Searching

To search for a whole phrase, it is common to put it in double quotations: "breach of contract".

#### Refining the Outcome

Look for ways to edit the search, maybe by adding an extra keyword.

### The Free Internet

By using google and stuff, quality can be reduced. Strongly advised to begin any elgal research with a more authoritative source.

#### Search Engines

- Enclose search term within inverted commas
- Prefacing with 'site' searches only a particular site
- '-site:' excludes results from a particular site
- 'intitle:' words in the title of a page

Google has an advanced search page. Alternatively, use Google Scholar.

#### Official Websites

- British and Irish Institute of Legal Information (<www.bailii.org)>  
- EUR-Lex (eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html)  
- legislation.gov (<www.legislation.gov.uk)>  
- Ministry of Justice (<www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice)>
- UK Parliament (<www.parliament.uk)>  
- UK Supreme Court (<www.supremecourt.uk)>

#### Portals and Directories

Gateways to selected free online legal information. One example is <www.venables.co.uk.>

#### Blogs and Wikis

Some information may be serious and useful, some will be frivolous.

#### Business Information

Information on companies and markets can be found on the FT, on Companies House, and The Gazette (<www.thegazette.co.uk).>

#### Collections

Some websites act as research collections.

- Law.com (<www.law.com/resources/)> is an extensive digital library of white papers, research, legal insights and press releases aimed at in-house and private practice lawyers.
- ResearchGate (<www.researchgate.net)> is another collection with more of an academic focus
- SSRN is another site providing access to research materials (<www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/lsn/),> covering over 30 disciplines, including law and management.

## Ch 4: Getting Started

### Halsbury's Laws of England

This runs to around 100 volumes. The same content is available online on the LexisLibrary database. It provides commendary upon the present state of all areas of English law.

#### Paper Version

4 steps:

- Index
	- Index volumes identify and give references to keywords
	- References will indicate context, followed by a numerical reference in bold to the main volume to referred to.
- Main volume
	- Statements of the law of England and Wales, arranged by subject. Each volume has its own subject index at the back.
- Cumulative supplement, and
	- Consult the annual two-volume Cumulative Supplement. A note in the front will give you that date to which the content has been updated. Developments since will be noted.
- Noter-up
	- Replaced monthly: alerts you to any very recent changes in the law.

#### Online Version

Available via LexisLibrary.

#### Searching

Find it in the My Bookshelf section of Lexis. Two routes into the database: Browse and Search. Building blocks are numbered paragraphs.

Click browse to drill down into information on a topic via a hierarchy, or use the search option to search the whole encyclopaedia. This content is updated weekly.

#### Practitioner Databases

Practical Law and Lexis PSL are databases aimed more at legal practitioners. Overview documents here are a good place to start research.

#### Practitioner Books

Written for practising lawyers, giving detailed coverage of an area of law. Don't assume up to date – even if using an online resource, check first.

### Primary Sources

See textbook for overview of how to do different things.

## Ch 5: Researching Case Law

### Case Publishing

The raw texts of Supreme Court judgments are published on the Court's website. BAILII collects judgments from a variety of UK courts. Archives of transcripts of judgments can be accessed via Westlaw and Lexis.

### Transcripts

A written and verbatim record of the court's judgment. There are two ways in which a court can give judgment:

1. Handing down
	1. Happens in more complex cases.
	2. Where the court reserves judgment and usually provides it at a later date in written form.
	3. Transcripts include a neutral citation
2. Ex tempore judgment
	1. In straightforward cases, the court gives judgment as soon as the case finishes.
	2. Judge gives a verbal judgment taken down by a shorthand stenographer.
	3. The transcript is sent to the judge for approval.

### Law Reports

Have all the information contained in a transcript but also some editorial enhancements. Usually produced when a case makes a change to or develops the law.

```ad-example
- The Law Reports (AC, QB, CH and Fam)
- The Weekly Law Reports (WLR)
- The All England Law Reports (All ER)

Brief reports are also published in The Times and practitioner's journals. 
```

If possible, use these reports rather than judgments. Cases not selected for inclusion in such publications are termed 'unreported'. Applies to 95% of the ~200,000 cases decided each year.

The courts will permit an advocate to cite an unreported case only if it 'contains a relevant statement of legal principle not found in reported authority' ([2012] 1 WLR 780).

### Order of Authority

The Law Reports are the nearest to an official series of case reports. They include arguments presented by counsel and are checked by the presiding judge before publication. Look out for an ICLR logo.

### Citing Cases

```ad-example
*Jordan v Burgoyne* [1963] 2 QB 744 means the report of the case of *Jordan v Burgoyne* starts  at p 744 of vol 2 of the Queen's Bench series of the Law Reports for 1963.
```

- If the year is superfluous, it appears in round brackets
- The number of the volume comes before the title of the series
- Reference to different series of reports are ordered in a hierarchy:
	1. Neutral citation
	2. Law Reports reference
	3. Weekly Law Reports
	4. All England Law Reports
	5. Other specialist series of law reports
	6. Newspaper law reports
- In Jan 2001, a new system of neutral citation of judgments was introduced. This is neutral as regards format and publisher. All cases heard in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the High Court are covered by these arrangements.
- Judgments since have been set out in numbered paragraphs.

### Finding Cases

Trainees regularly asked to track down a case based on incomplete information. If you only have a party name, try searching with this and also the subject matter of the case. Try checking the table of cases in a relevant practitioner book.

Use Westlaw Case Analysis and Lexis Case Overview features.

Check a case you have found is still good law. On Westlaw there's a traffic light symbol. Similarly, there are ticks on Lexis.

There is a long way to do this using paper resources.

### Finding Cases on a Subject

Online databases can be very helpful. On Westlaw click on case analysis below the entry of any case that looks promising.

You can always filter by court/ by judge etc.

## Ch 6: Researching Legislation

There are two major classes of legislation:

- Primary legislation is passed by Parliament in the form of Acts
- Secondary legislation is made under powers delegated by Parliament to government ministers; almost always taking the form of statutory instruments.

Usually you will need the version of the provision which is in force now. Use Halsbury's Statutes and Halsbury's Statutory Instruments as printed sources, or Westlaw and Lexis.

### Citing Legislation

A statute is generally cited by its short title, e.g., Human Rights Act 1998. Citations can also be by chapter number: citing HRA as 'c 42 1998' because it was the 42nd Act to be passed in 1998. Pre-1963, statutes were referred to be the year of the monarch's reign, which is dumb and confusing.

- Sections within an Act are abbreviated to 's'
- Schedules abbreviated to 'sch'. The parts of a schedule are paragraphs ('para'), not sections
- A statutory instrument is cited as 'SI [year]/[serial number]'.

The body of a statutory instrument is divided. The name of divisions depend on the form of title. If it is called an 'Order', the divisions are 'articles'. If it is a 'Regulation', the divisions are known as rules. A subdivision is always known as a paragraph.

| Category               | First division (numbered 1,2,3etc) | Second division ( numbered (1),(2),(3) etc ) | Third division ( lettered (a),(b),(c) etc ) |
|:---------------------- |:---------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Legislation:   |                                    |                                              |                                             |
| Act                    | section                            | subsection                                   | paragraph                                   |
| Bill                   | clause                             | subsection                                   | paragraph                                   |
| Secondary Legislation: | paragraph                          | sub-paragraph                                |                                             |
| Order                  | article                            | paragraph                                    | sub-paragraph                               |
| Regulations            | regulation                         | paragraph                                    | sub-paragraph                               |
| Rules                  | rule                               | paragraph                                    | sub-paragraph                               |
| Schedules:             |                                    |                                              |                                             |
| Schedule               | paragraph                          | sub-paragraph                                | paragraph                                            |

### Where to Find Acts

Find Acts of Parliament on legislation.gov.uk. But note that some Acts do not yet incorporate changes applied by subsequent Acts – there will be a big red sign saying there are outstanding changes to legislation. So use Westlaw and Lexis if possible.

There is also a print resource called Current Law Statutes. This is useful because it contained Hansard references, if you need background to the talks that happened in Parliament.

Halsbury's Statutes contain annotated statutes. Also see the consolidated index, main volumes, Current Statute Service binders, cumulative supplements, noter-up…

### Establishing if an Act is in Force

The last section of a statute usually deals with arrangements for its own commencement. If no commencement statement is made, can usually assume that the statute came into force on the date of Royal Assent.

But note that matters can be more complicated. There is a paperback volume 'Is it in Force', published as part of Halsbury's Statutes of England. This is also available on Lexis.

### Statutory Instruments

Find these on legislation.gov.uk too, or preferably on Westlaw/ Lexis.

### Legislation on Lexis

Lexis contains the full, amended text of UK primary and secondary legislation in force. Legislation recently enacted but not yet in force is also included. Split between 'UK Parliaments Acts' and 'UK Parliament SIs' databases. See textbook for details on how to do this.

Alternatively, use Westlaw 'Legislation' link. Always check and double check that information is current and up-to-date.

## Ch 7: Researching EU Law

Despite Brexit, EU law still impacts UK law (see public law 1). UK continues to have close links with Member States.

Key resources for researching EU law:

- Official Journal of the European Union. Two series: L (legislation) and C (information and notices).
- EU publishes lots of material free: see Europa and EUR-Lex.
- Practical Law includes a comprehensive section dealing on Brexit.

### General Sources

EUR-Lex: difficult to search on this, but useful and comprehensive. Free access to basically all EU law. Can do an advanced search with this.

### Primary Legislation

EU primary legislation comprises of the founding treaties along with later amending treaties. The official texts can be accessed via EUR-Lex.

Secondary legislation of the EU sets out how the objectives expressed are to be accomplished.

| Category        | Description                                                            | Example, as published in the Official Journal                                                                                                                                                                             |
|:--------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regulations     | Directly applicable to Member States: no need for national legislation | Commission Regulation (EC) No 2//2009 of january 2009 establishing the standard imporice of certain fruit and vegetables                                                                                                  |
| Directives      | Member States must legislate to implement within a fixed period        | Directive 2008/122/EC of the European Parliament and ofthe Council of 14 January 2009 on the protection of consumers in respect of certain aspects of timeshare, long-term holiday product, resale and exchange contracts |
| Decisions       | Addressed to particular Member States, companies or individuals        | Commission Decision of 23 January 2009 establishing the Committee of European Securities Regulators (2009/78/EC)                                                                                                          |
| Recommendations | Non-binding suggestions for action                                     | Commission Recommendation of 11 February 2009 on the implementation of a nuclear material accountancy and control system by operators of nuclear installations                                                            |

In practice, you will mainly encounter regulations and directives. As of 2015, there is a new, simpler numbering system.

Find secondary legislation on:

- EUR-Lex
- Blackstone's EU Treaties and Legislation reprints selection of the most useful secondary legislation.

To check if EU legislation is currently in force:

- Check EUR-Lex and filter by legislation in force
- Check Official Journal. EU legislation does not have legal force until it has been published in the Official Journal.

### Case Law

EU cases are heard before either the Court of Justice or the General Court.

Procedure of EU courts:

- Judgments are preceded by an 'opinion' of the Advocate General, which is not binding
- Applications to the court concerning the same area of law can be joined together
- The names of parties are often v long so nicknames given to certain leading cases
- Court delivers one judgment only – no dissenting opinions.

### Citation

A full citation gives the case number, followed by parties, then the citation of the authoritative report in the paper version of European Court Reports.

'C-' means Court of Justice (Cour), and 'T-' means General Court (Tribunal).

### Sources of EU Cases

- All judgments available on Curia (part of Europa). Easiest if you know the case number.
- Westlaw and Lexis feature the full text of European Court Reports.
- Common Market Law Reports a more timely but unofficial alternative to European Court Reports.
- All England Law Reports European Cases also reports cases from EU courts.

## Ch 8: Researching Forms and Precedents

Collections of forms and precedents provide specimens of the documents which lawyers need to draft. They can save lots of time and effort.

Many firms hold their own knowledge banks. Commercial publications also reproduce versions of prescribed or common documents.

See:

- Parker's Will Precedents
- Kelly's Draftsman
- Atkin's Court Forms
- Encyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents

Most of these are available through Lexis.

Practical Law has a bank of standard documents and clauses. LexisNexis has developed another database called LexisPSL, intended to be more practice-based.

### Atkin's Court Forms

Comprehensive encyclopaedia of forms. Be sure to read the commentary and footnotes.

### Encyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents

Source of precedents for non-contentious civil transactions. Annotations to the precedents offer practical drafting guidance and references to other helpful information like cases and legislation.

See textbook for details on how to use.

## Ch 9: The Result of Legal Research

### Recording Research

Accurate references save time and produce accountability. Take a note of what you do and when you do it.

Ensure the record includes:

- Date when research was carried out
- Full citations
- Reference information (Mendeley style)
- Database names and sections searched
- page references
- Dates of publication

### Reporting Research

Follow any set method/ structure firm has.

General points:

- Answer the question
- Begin by restating the objective
- Include a brief summary of conclusions at the start
- List issues and report on them separately, if there are multiple
- Consider the recipient of the research
- If the factual context is known, results should be applied to the facts
- Give full references
- Consider attaching most relevant sources
- State steps taken to update
- State date of research and record time spent
- State date report was compiled.

### Cite it Right

Sadly there are different guidelines. Academic reference style is OSCOLA, which is well documented.
