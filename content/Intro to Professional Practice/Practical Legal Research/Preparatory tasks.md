# Preparatory tasks

## Task 1

Under the Treasure Act 1996, any treasure found on or after 24/09/97, whatever the nature of the place where the treasure was found and whatever the circumstances in which it was left, vests in the franchisee, if there is one, or otherwise in the Crown.

Treasure includes any object at least 300 years old which is one of at least two coins in the same find which are at least 300 years old and have at least 10% precious metal by weight (s 1(1) Treasure Act 1996). The solid gold coins from the 7th Century which have been found are treasure for the purposes of the Act.

When treasure is found, it vests, subject to prior interests and rights, in the franchisee (if there is one), or otherwise in the Crown. The treasure must be reported to the local coroner within 14 days of first finding it (beginning from the day after finding it), or within 14 days of realising an item might be treasure. There is an unlimited fine or up to 3 months in prison for not reporting treasure. Note that this may change to a maximum 51 weeks imprisonment in the future.

Those who may be entitled to a share of the reward include:

- The finder, if they had permission to be on the land and acted in good faith
- A person or organisation with freehold on the land
- Someone who occupies the land as a tenant of the owner.

## Task 2

Objectives:

- Remove P from management of company
- Avoid negative publicity
- Not leave P without fair renumeration.
- Stopping MD sacking the employee. Can the board do this?

Issues:

- Shares in company
- Do we have to pay her/ give redundancy
	- Monica doesn't want to leave Paloma penniless.
- Monica avoiding publicity
	- She has a personal concern about being involved - works with vulnerable adults.
- Can you vote her off without telling her
- She's also employed

Distinguish between objectives and legal issues?

### Removal of Director

s 168: director can be removed from ordinary resolution.

The directors must call a board meeting using their powers under MA 9. At the BM they must, via a board resolution, call a General Meeting, using the powers conferred under s 302 CA 2006. The shareholders must give ‘special notice’ of a resolution to remove a director (s 168(2)). Special notice means that notice of the intention must be given to the company at least 28 days before the GM (s 312(1)). In calculating the notice period, the clear day rule applies (s 360); both the day on which notice is given and the day of the meeting are excluded. The director has a right to speak against their removal at the meeting and to make written representations to the shareholders in advance of the meeting (s 169). The company cannot use the written procedure method in this case (s 288(2)(a)).

Before this, see if you can do:

- Check directors contracts etc.
- Articles of association and shareholder contracts.

Use PLC (Practice Law for Companies)

### Can Managing Director Dismiss Paloma?

Directors have powers. Have these been delegated to managing director? If not done explicitly, could be within implied authority.

Directors' general authority MA 3.

### Don't Want to Sack but Want to Limit Authority

- Check employment contract to look at if anything is there?
- Can't usually unilaterally change a contract. But could ask her to agree? (otherwise we'll fire you)

Consolidation task: do the actual report. Address what happens to her employment if she is imprisoned.

There is also a **PLR workbook** - do this.

## Task 3

### 1.

Termination of employment in the event of a custodial sentence:

Under the Employment Rights Act 1996, fair reasons for terminating an employee's contract of employment include:

- The employee's conduct or capability
- Redundancy
- Statutory restriction preventing employment from continuing
- Some other substantial reason.

Being convicted of a criminal offence could itself count as misconduct. Could be capable of damaging an employer's reputation. Being unavailable for work and unable to perform contractual duties is likely to fall under either capability or the statutory category of 'some other substantial reason'. So it is likely that employment could be terminated, provided the employer acts reasonably.

Provided an employee has worked for 2 years, a thorough investigation and examination of the facts should be conducted before a decision to dismiss is taken.

<https://www.davidsonmorris.com/termination-of-employment-custodial-sentence/>

The employer must still be careful to act reasonably in dismissing the employee and follow a fair dismissal process.

Frustration of employment contract. In this case, Paloma is not being dismissed, contract frustrated. (Probably comes into renumeration and redundancy package details).
