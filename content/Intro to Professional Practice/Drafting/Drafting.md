# Drafting

## Steps

### Preparation and Research

Take instructions from client and ensure you have all the information needed. Then research the law.

### Planning

Decide on a structure. Many documents contain:

- Commencement
	- Describes nature of the document ('This Agreement/ This Conveyance'). Or use document title as heading
- Date
	- Insert at the end
- Parties
	- Full names and addresses of parties
- Recitals
	- Not essential, used to set out background facts to the documents (e.g. writing the date of death in a conveyance of land by a person's representative). But can also increase ambiguities.
- Operative part
	- Part creating legal rights and obligations.
	- Commercial agreement will generally contain:
		- Conditions precedent
		- Agreements (rights and obligations of each party)
		- Representations and warranties
		- 'Boiler-plate' clauses
- Testimonium
	- Not essential, but if used introduces the signatures of parties and may describe particular method of executing.
- Schedules
	- Like an appendix, refer to the schedle in the main operative part.
- Execution and attestation
	- The execution clause will refer to the signatures of the parties and any other formalities necessary to give the document legal effect. The wording of the clause will vary depending on the natures of the party executing, whether the document is executed as a deed, and whether their signature is witnessed.

#### Order of Clauses

The order of clauses in the operative part depends on the logic of the document. Options include:

- Chronological order (for a simple transaction such as car hire)
- Categorical order (e.g. lease)
- Order of importance (usually for simple contracts)
- Any combination of the above.

#### Structuring a Clause

- Use a separate clause for each part
- Use sub-paragraphing to avoid long clauses
- Number clauses and sub-clauses
- Use headings

#### Coode Structuring

George Coode wrote a treatise on how to structure a clause (which isn't always done, but is a good way to do it). His principle is to structure in the following order:

- Circumstances/ exceptions
	- e.g., 'except where', 'where', 'if… then', 'except where…'
- Conditions
	- On which rights or obligations depend
	- e.g., 'if', 'provided that'
- Obligation or right.

This logical structure is familiar to lawyers, but in certain circumstances it can be more natural not t use the rule.

#### Use of Precedents

A precedent can be helpful in planning a document, but they should be used with caution. Check they're up-to-date and relevant and stuff.

### Drafting

#### Use Definitions

Useful because:

- Creates a 'tag'
- Creates a private dictionary for the document, maybe giving a word an unusual or extended meaning.

Put definitions in alphabetical order in a definitions clause at the start of the operative part of the document. Or if a particular definition will only be used once, put it at the start of the relevant part/ clause. Can also use this throughout if the document is particularly short.

#### Definitions Guidelines

- Capitalise definition throughout
- Should only define, not create any substantive rights/ obligations
- Use the defined term!
- Check defined term makes sense in all contexts
- Do not define with reference to other undefined terms

#### Superfluous Words

Cut them out.

#### Tautology

Don't say the same thing twice using two words (e.g., unfilled vacancy). Don't use empty adjectives.

#### Compound Prepositions

Don't use stuff like 'in order to', 'in accordance with'. Use single prepositions instead (under/ by/ through/ about/ to).

#### Nouns Derived From Verbs

Use active rather than passive language (avoid e.g., 'give consideration to', say 'consider').

#### Archaic Language

Don't.

#### Adverbs and Adjectives

Don't use unnecessary adverbs and emotive language unless necessary.

#### Length

Keep sentences and paragraphs short.

#### Tenses

Active voice where possible. Overusing passive voice can make the sentence seem weak and obscure meaning.

#### Ex 1

1. The line manager will write a final warning letter
2. The committee will consider the matter at the next meeting
3. The solicitor gave notice.

```ad-note
There are times when the passive should be used to sound more objective and detached (e.g., the allegations are denied). Also use the passive voice where the subject of the legal action is irrelevant. 
```

#### Precision

Be precise. To avoid ambiguity:

- Take care with word order – so it is clear what is being referred to.
- Careful about 'and' or 'or'. Note that 'or' is ambiguous – do we mean XOR or OR? To avoid this, be explicit: e.g., 'the seller may do all or any of the following'/ 'the seller may only exercise one of the following rights'.
- The undistributed middle
	- Take care with 'before/ after' and 'over/ under' a particular weight/ measure.
	- With dates specify 'on or after' or 'before or on'
	- 'on or over 20kg'
- Don't be ambiguous with time – is today excluded or included? Safest to talk about time as:
	- From but excluding
	- From and including
	- On or after
	- Within 7 days commencing with
	- etc.
- Obligation or discretion?
	- Take care about using 'shall' since it can be used in the third person to indicate obligation ('the tenant shall pay rent') or in the first person to indicate simple future ('I shall go to London').
	- Can be safer to use 'must'
- Avoid words sounding/ appearing similar
	- e.g., mortagee/ mortgagor. Use lender/ borrower instead.
- Ambiguous pronouns
	- Saying 'he' or 'who' where there are multiple people this could refer to.
- Ejusdem generis rule
	- Phrases like 'any other cause' will be construed as meaning those in the same category as those already listed (see GDL)
- Shall/ will
	- First person: 'shall' looks to the future, 'will' expresses determination
	- Second/ third person: 'shall' expresses determination or obligation, 'will' looks to the future.
	- So this is really confusing and be careful.

### Layout and Presentation

- Use paragraphs
- Use tables
- Use numbering

#### Jargon

Don't use jargon. If you do then explain it.

### Checking

Always check your work, or get someone else to check it. Print it out etc. Double check people names, addresses etc. and references to other clauses/ schedules. Check document reflects client objectives.

### Practical and Ethical Considerations

Send the other side an additional copy of any draft sent for approval. SRA sets out principles of professional conduct: act with honesty, integrity and in a way that upholds public trust and confidence.

Don't mislead the other side – could be criminally fraudulent as well as professional misconduct. Point out mistakes of the other side – otherwise might nullify document/ make equitable remedies unavailable (clean hands).

#### Inclusive Language

- Use inclusive language
- Use the preferred form of address.
	- Ms can refer to any woman regardless of marital status
	- Mx is gender-neutral apparently
	- Or just use full name
	- Use they/them if you don't know someone's pronoun
- Characteristics
	- Only refer to age if necessary to do so
	- Say 'over 65' rather than OAP/ senior etc.
	- Disabilities and conditions
	- Positive language! Avoid 'afflicted by' etc.
	- Say a child with autism rather than an autistic child – people focussed language. 'People with mental health conditions' rather than 'mentally-ill people'.
- Race and ethnicity
	- Race is a categorisation on mainly physical characteristics - no genetic basis and is a social construct
	- Ethnicity: refers to shared cultural experiences, religion, languages, etc. Don't be racist.
	- BAME and BME commonly used to refer to people of non-white ethnicities. Terms are controversial themselves. Better to refer to racial inclusion than BAME inclusion.
- Sex, gender and sexuality
	- Sex is biological (male, female, intersex)
	- Gender identity is a psychological sense of self, based on how you see and describe yourself (male, female, non-binary or between). May be fixed or fluid
		- Cisgender - identify with gender assigned at birth
		- Transgender - umbrella term, identify with opposite gender to that with which registered at birth.
		- Ask about preferred forms of address
	- Sexuality: physical, romantic or emotional attachment to others.
- Use gender-neutral language; try to avoid chairman, statesman, mankind, manmade etc.
	- Don't say actress, say actor
	- You can repeat the noun (person) rather than using the pronoun (him) to achieve more gender neutral language.
	- Pairing
		- Using both the male and female pronouns ('she/he', 'her/his')
		- Best choice to explicitly include both pronouns, but generally not recommended practice.
	- Change pronoun
		- Use 'they/them', but just ensure that this does not lead to ambiguity.
		- Use 'one' as a pronoun
		- Use 'who' as a pronoun
		- Use gender-neutral pronoun 'ze/zir' (no one does this)
		- Omit the gendered word! V effective
		- Use the passive voice (but can lack clarity)

#### Ex 2

1. The candidate must have written approval from the Chairperson before formally admitted
2. A person must be a permanent employee at the firm for 20 years before they may apply for a long-term service benefit
3. In the event of an absence, mothers, should contact the receptionist before 09:00 and give details of the child's cause of absence.
4. The Managing Partner may remove a Committee Member from office if the member has failed to attend a meeting for a period of 6 months or more. The Managing Partner has the discretion to appoint a replacement Committee Member for the remainder of the calendar year.
5. The appellant is a 45yo man with cancer. Since the accident in 2020, he uses a wheelchair and has been diagnosed as epileptic.

### Writing Letters

#### Addressee

- Lay client
	- Avoid jargon and legalese when writing to a lay client, but also don't patronise
- Business client
	- Will be familiar with solicitor's' letters, get to the point quickly
- Other solicitors
	- Position of strength?
	- Conciliatory or non-conciliatory tone?

#### Ghosting

If writing letters signed in the partner's name, check their style of writing and how well the partner knows the client.

#### Starting and Ending Letter

- 'Dear Sir/ Madam' pairs with 'Yours faithfully'
- 'Dear Mr Smith' pairs with 'Yours sincerely'
- 'Dear John' pairs with 'Yours sincerely' or 'Yours'

#### Content

- Feel free to use numbering and headings.
- If writing in the firm's name, use 'we' and be consistent.
- Acknowledge the last communication, or if the first letter, explain involvement.
- State purpose of letter.

#### Practical Points

- Be detached
- How would the letter sound if read in open court?
- Consider giving the deadline for reply

### Writing Reports and Memoranda

- What is the purpose
- Is the research complete?
- Edit material - keep it brief but not too brief
- Plan out report to produce logical argument. Consider including
	- Contents page
	- Introduction of why report was commissioned
	- Brief summary of report before the main text for quick reference
	- Diagrams
	- Case or statute
	- Bibliography
	- Appendices
	- Acknowledgements of sources of information
- Style: think about audience and if you should paraphrase stuff for brevity
- Layout - make it clear
	- If a discussion document, leave wide margins and room for annotation
- Final checks: print report, rewrite if necessary

### Memoranda

Usually as a solicitor you'll have to write two types of memoranda:

- Attendance notes
	- As a record of meetings/ phone calls with clients/ solicitors
- Internal memoranda
	- Communicating with others in the firm

#### Attendance Notes

Put on a file as a record of an oral discussion/ transaction or agreement. Useful when someone takes over the file and was not present at the meeting, or when recording chargeable time spent on a matter. Write the attendance note as soon as possible after the meeting. Always try to take contemporaneous notes – and don't destroy these after; always keep.

#### Internal Memoranda

Keep internal memoranda brief and business-like, but take care with tone.

Structure:

| Memorandum |
| ----------------------- |
| From: |
| To: |
| Fee earner's reference: |
| Date: |
| Client's name: |
| Client's matter: |

### Spelling and Grammar

Don't get it wrong. Poor grammar is distracting and leaves a poor impression.

## Tutorial

### Substance

- Agreement must reflect client instructions
- Must be legal
- Legal formalities complied with.

### Clarity

- A logical structure
- Layout
- Appropriate language

Larger agreements may include an index of topics dealt with in each paragraph. Terms relating to specific elements of the agreement should be dealt with together. Note, there is no universal way to number provisions.

You will also find that some lawyers refer to paragraphs, others to clauses and some to sections, when referring to elements of an agreement.

Use simple English where possible.

### Precedents

Be careful to read every clause and double check relevance.

### Tips

For each provision you draft, ask yourself:

- Are there any conditions to be complied with for the clause to operate? If so, state them.
- Who has to fulfil the obligation? State who this is. This will help you in drafting in the active, rather than passive tense
- What do they have to do?
- To whom/for whom do they have to do this? When? Why? Where? How?

Be careful about consequential amendments – try to make your document auto-fix the numbering etc.

Keep things short and simple. Edit as you go. Proofread at the end!
