# Preparation task

The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 applies to business liability exemption clauses. Under s 2(1), liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence cannot be excluded.

Under s 2(2), in the case of other loss or damage, liability for negligence can only be excluded so far as it is reasonable.

The clause currently states:

> **“LIABILITY EXCLUDED**
>
> The Owner is not to be liable for the death of, or injury to, the Licensee [or his employees] or for damage to any property of theirs, or for any losses, claims, demands, actions, proceedings, damages, costs or expenses or other liability incurred by them in the exercise or purported exercise of the rights granted by Clause X.”

This does not comply with UCTA 1977 because it attempts to exclude all liability, including that for personal injury or death due to negligence. (s 2(1)) UCTA)). Other negligence liability subject to reasonableness.

The clause should be redrafted to

> **“LIABILITY EXCLUDED**
>
> Other than liability incurred through negligence, the Owner is not to be liable for the death of, or injury to, the Licensee [or his employees] or for damage to any property of theirs, or for any losses, claims, demands, actions, proceedings, damages, costs or expenses or other liability incurred by them, in the exercise or purported exercise of the rights granted by Clause X.
>
> The owner is not (unreasonably) liable for loss or damage caused through negligence other than death or personal injury. Nothing in this exemption affects the limitation on excluding liability for negligence under UCTA 1977.”

Shorten the list of nouns to 'property damage, financial losses and litigation'. This avoids the risk of missing something very specific, too. Brevity can be helpful here.
