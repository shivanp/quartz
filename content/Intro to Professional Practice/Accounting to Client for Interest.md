Relevant legislation:

| Statute                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Principle 5             | You act with integrity                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Principle 7             | You act in the best interests of each client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| para 1.2 Code for Firms | You do not abuse your position by taking unfair advantage of clients or others.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| para 5.1 Code for Firms | You properly account to clients for any financial benefit you receive as a result of their instructions, except where they have agreed otherwise.                                                                                                |
| r 7.1 Accounts Rules    | You account to clients or third parties for a fair sum of interest on any client money held by you on their behalf.                                                                                                                              |
| r 7.2 Accounts Rules    | You may by a written agreement come to a different arrangement with the client or the third party for whom the money is held as to the payment of interest, but you must provide sufficient information to enable them to give informed consent. |

So it is up to firms to decide what is a fair way to calculate interest and how often to pay it. Usually there is a minimum threshold set for interest to be payable to the client.

### Dealing with Interest

Firms can choose to pay client money into:

1. A general client bank account, or
2. A separate deposit bank account for that particular client.

Usually a separate account is used where a significant amount of client money is to be held for some time. Generally, firms will account to clients for all interest earned on money in designated accounts â‡¾ acting in the client's best interests.

When a general client account is used, the firm has a bit more discretion. Should aim to earn interest on client money and have that interest paid into the business bank account. A sum is then paid from the business bank account as an expense.

### Choice of Method

Under the Solicitors Act 1974, solicitors are allowed to keep any interest earned over and above what is required to be paid under the rules. By putting all client money into a single account, the firm can earn a high rate of interest, and only pay out a lower 'fair' rate of interest to a particular client.

## Separate Deposit Account

When opening a separate deposit account, ensure the recording requirements of r 8.1 Accounts Rules is complied with (client ledger and cash ledger records).

## General Client Account

The firm has to calculate how much would have been earned in respect to each individual client. A well-organised firm will put a proportion of client money on deposit in a general deposit bank account. Then it should be able to make money.
