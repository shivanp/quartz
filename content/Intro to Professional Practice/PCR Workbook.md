# PCR Workbook

## Task 1

### Q1

It is permissible to phone Barbara in these circumstances, since approaches to current or potential business connections do not count as approaches to "members of the public" for the purposes of para 8.9 Code for Solicitors, and so are permitted provided they comply with the general law.

Barbara could not be copied into correspondence with the buyer's solicitors, since this would be a breach of client confidentiality under para 6.3 CFS. The introduction and referral is permissible, so long as they comply with the principles, and so long as the client has given informed consent (para 5.2 CFS) to the referral/ introduction.

### Q2

You cannot use the information about PSL's management and financial resources due to client confidentiality (para 6.3 CFS). Equally, you cannot act against PSL because under para 6.5, a solicitor must not act for a client in a matter where the client has an interest adverse to the interest of another current or former client for whom confidential information which is material to that matter is held, unless the exceptions in para 6.5(a) or (b) are met.

The financial and management information is material because it would benefit your new clients. Since it would benefit the new clients who are involved in litigation against PSL, it would therefore be adverse to PSL.

Where para 6.5 applies, a firm may still act if:

1. Effective measures have been taken meaning there is no real risk of disclosure, or
2. PSL gives informed consent, given or evidenced in writing.

On the facts, this will not be possible.

### Q3

Para 6.2 states you cannot act where there is a conflict of interest or a significant risk of such a conflict, unless an exception under para 6.2(a) or (b) applies. A conflict of interest is where you owe separate duties to act in the best interests of two or more clients in relation to the same or a related matters conflict.

Since you drafted the new service contracts for employees, and the other client wants legal advice on the terms of their service contract, there is a significant risk of a conflict in related matters. For example, on the basis of your advice on the terms, the client may decide to commence litigation.

Neither of the exceptions apply, since there is no substantial common interest between the parties and clients are not competing for the same objective.

### Q4

No, you cannot act under para 6.1 because there is a significant risk of an own interest conflict: your duty to act in the best interests of the client may conflict with your own interests.

### Q5

No, you cannot sell the house to your daughter for £300,000 because under Principle 7, a solicitor is under an overriding duty to act in the best interests of their clients. By selling the house for 100k less than it could be sold for, the best interests of the client would not be protected.

### Q6

Yes you can prepare the will, but only if you are sure that the client is making a fully informed decision.

SRA guidance: if you draft a will where the client wishes to make a gift of significant value to you, satisfy yourself that the client has first taken independent legal advice with regard to making the gift. Decline to act unless the client agrees to take independent legal advice.

### Q7

There is no conflict of interest under para 6.2 because Savecentres is a former client. However, you still owe a duty of confidentiality to Savacentres under para 6.3. Under para 6.5, a solicitor must not act for a client in a matter where the client has an interest adverse to the interest of another client or former client for whom confidential information which is material to that matter is held, unless an exception is met. When dealing with Discountfever, you cannot reveal any of this confidential information.

Para 6.5 not relevant because information is not adverse.

CANNOT act, because you have information material to Discountfever's matter, which must be disclosed to the client under para 6.4, but para 6.3 requires you to keep this confidential. Savacentres must consent to you acting - unlikely.

So cannot consent because you cannot comply with your personal duty of disclosure.

### Q8

- Must comply with the principles
- Client's informed consent (para 5.3 CFS)
- Financial interests must be disclosed to the client (para 5.1(a)) in a way which the client understands, allowing them to make an informed decision (para 8.6).
- No payments made/ received in respect of clients subject to criminal proceedings (para 5.1(d)) or in claims for personal injury or death (s 57(7) LSPO 2012).
- Clients must be informed of any fee sharing arrangement. The arrangement must be in writing (para 5.1(b)).

## Task 2

### Q1

Clients must be informed of:

1. Information to enable them to understand whether and how services provided are regulated 8.11.
2. Information placing them in a position to be able to make informed decisions about the services needed… para 8.6
3. Best possible info of how matter should be priced: para 8.3(a) and (b)

Informed in writing:

- Right to complain para 8.3(a) and (b)
- Right to complain to ombudsman (8.3(c))

### Q2

Before starting court proceedings, check:
