# Administration of Estate

```toc
```

## Introduction

After PRs have obtained the grant, they must administer the estate. Includes:

- Collecting deceased's assets
- Paying funeral and testamentary expenses and debts
- Distribute the legacies
- Complete administration and distribute residual estate.

## Administration Period

```mermaid
graph LR

id1(Moment after death) --> id2(Administration period)
id2 --> id3(PRs ready to vest residue <br/> of estate in beneficiaries, <br/> or trustees if trust arises)
```

But PR holds office for life, so must deal with further assets and liabilities if they are later discovered.

## PR Duties

```ad-statute
title: s 25, Administration of Estates Act 1925
The personal representative of a deceased person shall be under a duty to collect and get in the real and personal estate of the deceased and administer it according to law.
```

PR **personally liable** for losses to the estate resulting from any breach of duty they commit.

```ad-statute
title: s 61 Trustee Act 1925 - Power to relieve trustee from personal liability.
If it appears to the court that a trustee, whether appointed by the court or otherwise, is or may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the commencement of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the court in the matter in which he committed such breach, then the court may relieve him either wholly or partly from personal liability for the same. 
```

There may be a clause in the will providing protection from liability for mistakes made in good faith.

## Protection Against Liability

- s 27 TA 1925 protects against personal liability to unknown beneficiaries when requirements are complied with.
- But does not protect against claim from missing known beneficiaries:
	- Use a Benjamin order. The court will require evidence that full enquiries were made to find the missing person.
	- Or take out insurance (may be cheaper).
- Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975
	- PRs will be personally liable if a successful application for “reasonable financial provision” is made.
	- Protect against liability by waiting **$>6$ months from the date of grant of representation** before distributing assets/ retaining sufficient assets to deal with any such claim after 6 months.

## Administrative Powers

TA 2000 prescribes powers to invest trust property, appoint agents of agents and nominees, remuneration of trustees and to insure trust property. A duty of care is imposed, having regard to special knowledge/ skills of the trustee.

### Powers Granted by Will

- Many statutory powers can be varied by express provision in the will.
- Will can grant additional powers.
- Will drafting
	- Good practice to fully set out the powers of the executors
	- $\exists$ STEP (Society of Trust and Estates Practitioners) Standard Provisions

| Power to appropriate assets without consent of beneficiaries | s 41 AEA 1925: PRs have power to appropriate any part of the estate in/ towards satisfaction of a legacy/ share of residential estate, provided the appropriation does not prejudice any specific beneficiary. Beneficiary must consent to the appropriation.                               | Relieve trustees of the duty to ask consents of beneficiaries. A general power to re-appropriate assets for trustees is useful. |
| Power to insure                                              | s 19 TA 1925: PRs and trustees have power to insure trust property against any risks, to the full value of the property, and to pay premiums out of capital or income.                                                                                                                      | Can give trustees the power to insure the life of the beneficiary/ settlor.                                                     |
| Power to accept receipts from/ on behalf of minors           | Generally, unmarried minor cannot ive a good receipt for capital or income. Married minor can give good receipt for income (s 21 LPA 1925). s 3 Children Act 1989 provides that parents with parental responsibility have the right to receive/ recover money for the benefit of the child. | Allow PRs to accept receipt from a child over 16/ leave legacy to trustees for the benefit of a minor.                          |

#### Administration of Trusts Provisions

In many cases, PRs will hold the residue of the estate as trustees:

1. Where the beneficiary has a contingent interest
2. Where the interests in the property are divided (e.g., between income and capital).

### Maintenance and Advancement

![[Trustee powers and duties#Maintenance and advancement]]

## Collecting Deceased's Assets

- PRs produce grant of representation to whoever is holding the various asset, and then collect them.
- For some assets, a grant is not required (e.g., realising assets under Administration of Estates (Small Payments) Act 1965).

Some properties do not devolve on the PRs:

- Life interest
- Joint tenancy
- Policy held in trust for others
- Pension schemes

## Funeral and Testamentary Expenses

- PR should pay outstanding debts and the funeral account as soon as monies can be collected/ realised
- May need to repay a loan from deceased's bank to pay IHT to obtain the grant.
	- Such a loan will probably have come with a 'first proceeds' undertaking.
- When considering which assets to sell, PRs should consider:
	1. Provisions of deceased's will
	2. Beneficiaries' wishes
	3. Tax consequences.

### Funeral Expenses

Reasonable funeral expenses are payable from the deceased's estate.

### Testamentary Expenses

These are expenses incident to the proper performance of the duties of a PR. Includes:

- Costs of obtaining grant
- Costs of collecting and preserving deceased's assets
- Costs of administering deceased's estate (solicitor and valuer fees)
- IHT payable on death of deceased's property in the UK which vests in the PRs (s 211 IHTA 1984).

### Solvent Estate

The statutory order for payment of debts is set out in AEA 1925, Sch 1, Part II (s 34(3) AEA 1925).

```ad-test
title: General rule
When choosing assets to pay funeral/ testamentary expenses and debts, assets forming part of the reside are to be used before property given to specific legatees. 
```

#### Subject to

The above order is subject to:

- s 35 AEA 1925: a beneficiary who takes an asset which is security for a debt takes the asset subject to the debt.
- The will can vary ss 34(3) & 35 – check for any provisions.

### Insolvent Estate

```ad-defn
An estate is insolvent if the assets are insufficient to discharge in full the funeral, testamentary and administration expenses, debts and liabilities.
```

In doubtful cases, PRs should administer the estate as if it is insolvent.

For an insolvent estate being administered out of court, follow the order of distribution in Administration of Insolvent Estates of Deceased Persons Order 1986.

## Paying Legacies

Step 2; consider discharging the gifts arising on death, other than gifts of the residuary estate. Consider making interim distributions to the residuary beneficiaries.

### Specific Legacies

- Methods of transferring the property to the beneficiary/ trustee will vary
	- The legal estate in a house or flat should be vested in a beneficiary by an 'assent'.
- In the case of specific gifts (only), the vesting of the asset in the beneficiary is retrospective to the date of death, so that any income produced by the property.
	- Beneficiary is not entitled to the income as it arises, but must wait for the PR to vest the property in the beneficiary.
- Costs of transferring the property to a legatee and cost of insurance cover taken are the responsibility of the legatee, who should reimburse the PR.

### Pecuniary Legacies

The will may specify an intention to pay the legacy, e.g., from the residuary estate. Where the will makes no such provision for pecuniary legacies, they are paid primarily from residuary personalty.

#### Time for Payment

- General rule
	- Pecuniary legacy payable at the end of “the executor's year”: one year after testator's death.
	- s 44 EA 1925: PRs are not bound to distribute the estate before the expiration of one year from the death.
- 4 occasions where interest is payable on a pecuniary legacy from the date of death:
	1. Legacy payable in satisfaction of debt owed to a creditor
	2. Legacy charged on land owned by testator
	3. Legacy payable to the testator's minor child
	4. Legacy payable to any minor where the intention is to provide for the maintenance of that minor.

## Administration and Distribution

Before drawing up estate accounts and making a final distribution of residue, the PRs should deal with IHT liability and taxes.

### Adjusting IHT Assessment

The amount of IHT payable may have to be adjusted since the IHT account was submitted:

- Discovery of additional assets/ liabilities
- Discovery of lifetime transfers
- Agreement of provisionally estimated values
- Agreement between PRs and HMRC of a tax liability or repayment
- “Loss relief” from sales made by PRs after deceased's death.

#### IHT Loss Relief

PRs often force to sell assets to raise cash to pay for debts, tax liabilities or legacies. If PRs end up selling assets for less than their value at the date of death, they can claim loss on sale relief.

```ad-important
Where ‘qualifying investments’ are sold within 12 months of death for less than their market value at the date of death (ie ‘probate value’) then the sale price may be substituted for the market value at death and the IHT liability adjusted accordingly (IHTA 1984, ss 178–189).
```

- ‘Qualifying investments’ are shares or securities which are quoted on a recognised stock exchange at the date of death, and also holdings in authorised unit trusts.
- Relief is not automatic; must be claimed.
- Available only when PR makes the sale, not when the beneficiary does.
- If relief claimed, value of qualifying investments at death must be reduced for CGT purposes (s 187).
	- So never claim the relief if the estate is passing to a surviving spouse/ civil partner.

#### Limitation

To stop PRs selling shares to create a loss and then either buying them back (‘bed and breakfasting’) or reinvesting the proceeds in other shares, s 180 restricts the relief where the appropriate person buys new qualifying investments within the period starting with death and ending two months after the date of the last sale.

ss 190-198: provisions allowing loss relief in relation to the sale of land within 4 years of a death at a loss.

### Continuing IHT Liability

#### IHT Instalments

- If PRs opted to pay IHT by instalments, they continue to be liable until all instalments have been paid.
- So don't transfer all the assets to the beneficiaries.

#### IHT on Lifetime Transfers

- General rule: donees of lifetime transfers are primarily liable for the tax. P
- Rs of the donor’s estate may become liable if the tax remains unpaid by the donees 12 months after the end of the month in which the donor died.
- PRs’ liability is limited to the extent of the deceased’s assets which they have received, or would have received in the administration of the estate, but for their neglect or default.
- If the deceased gave away property during their lifetime but reserved a benefit in that property, such property is treated as part of their estate on death.
	- The same procedure applies: PRs liable if tax remains unpaid after 12 months.

### Corrective Account

Submit Form C4 to HMRC to report all variations to assets/ liabilities and reliefs.

### IHT Clearance

PRs will want to obtain confirmation from HMRC that there is no further claim to IHT. Effects:

- Discharges the PRs and all other persons from further liability to IHT (unless there is fraud/ non-disclosure of material facts).
- Extinguishes any charge imposed by HMRC on deceased's property.

HMRC must apply for a clearance certificate using form IHT30. They will reply with a letter certifying the discharge.

```ad-action
Immediately following the death, the PRs must make a return to HMRC of the income and capital gains of the deceased for the period starting on 6 April before the death and ending with the date of death.
```

- Any liability to tax is a debt of the deceased, to be paid by PRs during administration.
- Any tax refund represents an asset.

#### Administration Period

For each income tax year (or part) during the administration period, the PRs must calculate their income tax and CGT liability on assets disposed of for administration purposes.

#### Paying Income Tax & CGT

PRs can make a **one-off informal payment** of all income tax and CGT at the end of administration, unless the estate is classified as a complex estate.

```ad-defn
title: Complex estate
An estate is considered complex if either: 
1. the value of the estate exceeds £2.5 million; or 
2. tax due for the whole of the administration period exceeds £10,000; or 
3. the value of assets sold in a tax year exceeds £500,000.
```

##### Exception

UK residential land must be paid within a short period of completion of the sale.

#### Income Tax

The rules of income tax for PRs are special:

- No higher rate of income tax
- No personal savings and dividend allowance
- There is still a personal allowance.

| Asset        | Rate of tax |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Dividends    | 8.75%       |
| Other income | 20%         |

##### ISAs

Investments held in an ISA wrapper will not be liable to income tax (or CGT) during the administration of the deceased’s estate, or three years from the death, whichever is the shorter. PRs will, therefore, pay no tax during that period on the deceased’s ISA investments.

##### Concession

If the only income is interest and the interest does not exceed £500, PRs pay no income tax.

#### Relief

If PRs take out a bank loan to pay the IHT on the deceased's personal property in the UK in order to obtain a grant, relief can be claimed on any interest paid on the bank loan.

#### Beneficiary's Income Tax Liability

After PR's income tax position settled, net income will be paid to the beneficiary. The beneficiary must report the grossed up amount of this income in their income tax return.

PRs must supply beneficiary with Form R185 - certificate of deduction of tax. Beneficiaries whose income, including the estate income, is not above the level of the personal allowance or the savings or dividend allowances can reclaim the tax paid.

### Capital Gains Tax

- On death, there is no disposal for CGT purposes, so no liability arises.
- If PRs dispose of chargeable assets during the administration of the estate to raise cash, they are liable to CGT on an chargeable gains they make (except ISAs)
- Rate is 20%, or 28% for residential property.
- PRs may also deduct from the disposal consideration the incidental cost of the disposal, and a proportion of the cost of valuing the deceased's estate for probation purposes.
- PRs may claim the annual exemption for the tax year in which the deceased's died, and the following two years (if the administration lasts this long).
- Exemption of £12,300/ year
	- The PRs could plan asset sales carefully to realise gains in stages for each tax year it is available.

#### Sale at a Loss

An allowable loss for CGT will arise if PRs sell assets for less than their value at death. The loss may be relieved by setting it against gains in the same or any future tax year by the PRs. Plan sales carefully.

#### Accelerated CGT Payment on UK Residential Land

Finance Act 2019, s 14 & Sch 2: accelerated reporting and payment dates for CGT on UK land disposed of by non-residents. Return and payment must be submitted within 60 days of the disposal.

The charge extends to all disposals of UK residential land on/ after 6 April 2020, but only where tax is due.

The tax is paid using an approximation of the level of income expected during the year. The payment is made on account of the tax due at the end of the year.

#### Transfer of Assets to Legatees

If PRs vest the assets in the legatees rather than selling them, no chargeable gain or allowable loss arises. The beneficiary or trustee is assumed to acquire the asset transferred at its probate value.

### Transfer of Assets to Residuary Beneficiaries

If there have been interim distributions to certain beneficiaries, these should be taken into account when determining the transfer of remaining assets to the residuary beneficiaries .

| Entitlement | Adult                                                                                            | Minor                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Vested      | Entitlement can be transferred to them.                                                          | Property usually held on trust until age of majority reached. May be possible to transfer minor's beneficial entitlement if expressly authorised in the will, or to parents/ guardians on the behalf of the minor. |
| Contingent  | Property must be transferred to trustees to hold on their behalf until contingency is satisfied. | Property held on trust until age of majority reached and/or contingency satisfied.                                                                                                                                 |

#### Personal Property

The PRs indicate that they no longer require property for administration purposes when they pass title to it by means of an assent. Note that the beneficiary's title to the property derives form the will. The assent just gives effect to the gift by the PRs.

Company shares are transferred y share transfer form, unless held by a nominee company (as is often the case).

#### Freehold/ Leasehold Property

Personal representatives vest the legal estate in land in the person entitled (whether beneficially or as trustee) by means of an assent, which will then become a document of title to the legal estate.

```ad-tip
If PRs continue to hold the property in their changed capacity as trustees, PRs should 'assent' to this to formally vest the legal estate in themselves as trustees. 
```

#### Assent Formalities

```ad-statute
title: s 36(4) AEA 1925
An assent to the vesting of a legal estate shall be in writing, signed by the personal representative, and shall name the person in whose favour it is given and shall operate to vest in that person the legal estate to which it relates; and an assent not in writing or not in favour of a named person shall not be effectual to pass a legal estate.
```

The Land Registration Rules 2003 specify the form of an assent further.

Any person in whose favour the PRs make an assent or conveyance may require notice of it to  
be endorsed on the original grant of probate or administration. It is good practice to make this endorsement routinely at the same time as giving the assent.

If title to the land is registered, 2 options for the PRs:

- Apply to be registered as proprietor in place of the deceased.
	- PRs produce grant of representation when making application.
- Transfer the property by assent without being registered as proprietor.
	- Beneficiary must be given a certified copy of the grant of representation, to present with their application for registration.

### Estate Accounts

PRs must produce estate accounts for the residuary beneficiaries. Purpose: to show all the assets of the estate, the payment of debts, administration expenses and legacies and balance remaining for residuary beneficiaries.

The residuary beneficiaries sign the accounts to indicate approval -> releases PRs from further liability.
