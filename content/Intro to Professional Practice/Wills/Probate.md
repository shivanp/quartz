# Probate

```toc
```

## Introduction

It is necessary for assets to be transferred upon death into the names of beneficiaries. Normally necessary to obtain a court document authorising the deceased's PRs to transfer assets. Known as a **grant of representation**.

The process of applying for a grant is governed by the Non-contentious Probate Rules 1987  
(NCPR 1987) as amended.

### Digital Probate

Professionals are obliged to apply for grants of probate online, subject to certain exceptions.

Where applications are made online, supporting documentation, such as the death certificate, original will and HMRC forms have to be sent separately to HMCTS Probate at Harlow where they are scanned.

### Fees

The application fee is £273 where the estate exceeds £5,000. There is no fee if the estate is £5,000 or less.

## PRs

- If the will is valid and contains an effective appointment of executors of whom one or more is willing and able to prove the deceased’s will, a grant of probate will be issued to the executor(s) willing to act.
- If there is a valid will, but there are no persons willing or able to act as executors, then the next persons entitled to act are administrators with the will annexed.
- If a deceased left no will, or no valid will, the estate will be administered in accordance with the law of intestacy by administrators appointed by the application of NCPR 1987, r 22.

| PR            | Number of PRs required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Authority                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Executor      | One executor may obtain a grant and act alone, even if the estate contains land which may be sold during the administration. Note the difference with a trust, where two trustees are needed.                                                               | An executor derives authority to act in the administration of an estate from the will. The grant of probate confirms that authority. |
| Administrator | In the case of administrators (with or without the will), it is normally sufficient for one to act in the administration of the estate. However, where the will or intestacy creates a life or minority interest, two administrators are normally required. | An administrator (with or without the will) has very limited powers before a grant is made. Their authority stems from the grant which is not retrospective to the date of death.                                                                                                                                     |

### First Steps

| Step                   | Details                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Will                   | If there is a will, ensure all executors named receive copies.                                                                                                          |
| Funeral directions     | Check any special directions as to cremation/ use of body for medical research, etc.                                                                                    |
| Assets and liabilities | Obtain details of the deceased’s property and of any debts outstanding at the date of death.                                                                            |
| Beneficiaries          | Identify beneficiaries and entitlements, whether gifts are part of estate, and whether beneficiaries are alive. Inform beneficiaries that personal data is held (GDPR). |

### Missing/ Unknown Creditors and Beneficiaries

PRs are responsible for administering the estate correctly. If the PRs fail to pay someone who is entitled either as a creditor or as a beneficiary, they will be personally liable to that person.

PRs can protect themselves against unknown claims by advertising for claimants complying with the requirements of the Trustee Act 1925, s 27. Provided they wait for the time period specified in the section (at least two months), the PRs will be protected from liability if an unknown claimant later appears. However, the claimant will have the right to claim back assets from the beneficiaries who received them.

#### Advertising

- Advertise as early as possible
- Can use the following methods:
	- Advertisement in the London Gazette
	- Advertisement in a local newspaper of the area
	- Such other like notices.
- Include time limit in notice for persons to come forward, which must be not less than 2 months from date of notice.
- Make searches in the case of land, to check any benefits or burdens.

After notice has expired, PRs should distribute the estate.

#### Liability

Trustee Act 1925, s 27 exempts trustees from liability from unknown claims provided they have advertised as above. But does not protect PRs who knows there is a person with a claim but cannot find them.

#### Missing Known creditors/ Beneficiaries

Options:

1. Retain some assets in case claimant appears
2. Take an indemnity from beneficiaries that they will meet any claims if claimant reappears (dangerous for the PR)
3. Take out insurance to provide funds. Can be expensive
4. Apply to court for a *Benjamin* order: an order for distribution on the basis that the claimant is dead. Protects PR from liability, though claimant retains the right to recover assets from beneficiaries.

## Necessity of Grant of Representation

Not always necessary to obtain a grant of representation.

### Assets Passing to PRs without a Grant

- Orders made under Administration of Estates (Small Payments) Act 1965 permits payments $\leq £5,000$ to persons appearing to be beneficially entitled to the assets without formal proof of title.
- Chattels
- Cash

### Assets Not Passing Through PR

- Beneficially joint property passes by survivorship to the surviving joint tenant.
- But transferring tenants in common property requires a grant of representation.

### Property Not Forming Part of Estate

- A life insurance policy held on trust for another. The proceeds make tax-free provision for dependents of the deceased.
- Death in service benefits under a pension scheme. Tax-free provision for dependants.

## Applying for Grant

A grant of representation is an order of the [[High Court]].

Documents to submit:

- HMRC Form IHT421 (confirming payment of IHT) or Form IHT205 if the estate was 'excepted'.
- Deceased's will and codicil, plus 2 photocopies.
- Any supporting evidence required
- Probate court fees (£173 if estate $\geq £5,000$).
- Form PA1P/ PA1A (will/ no will) if paper application.

### Admissibility of Will

To ensure the will is admissible, check:

- The will is the last will
- Will has not been validly revoked
- Executed in accordance with s 9 Wills Act 1837
- Contains an attestation clause raising a presumption of due execution.

### Additional Requirements

Registrar may require further evidence, in the form of a statement of truth/ affidavit. This may include:

- Evidence of due execution and/or capacity
	- If there is no attestation clause/ other defect, some sort of attesting witness statement will be required.
	- If mental capacity is doubted, a witness statement from a doctor may be necessary.
- Evidence as to knowledge and approval
	- Registrar may doubt whether the testator was aware of the contents of the will on execution.
	- Affidavit/ witness statement will be requested.
- Evidence as to remote witnessing
- Evidence as to plight and condition.
	- If the state of the will suggests it has been interfered with since execution, further evidence will be required.

A will known to have been in the testator's possession but which cannot be found following death will be presumed to have been destroyed by the testator with the intention of revocation. If the will is lost/ destroyed accidentally, a copy/ reconstruction can be used, together with suitable witness affidavits and witness statements.

## Completing IHT Account

- If the estate is not an excepted estate, PRs will prepare an IHT400.
- The IHT400 is an inventory of the assets to which the deceased was beneficially entitled and of their liabilities, and is the form for claiming reliefs and exemptions and calculating the IHT payable.
- It should be delivered within 12 months of the end of the month in which the death occurred.
- Where IHT is payable, it is necessary to apply for a reference number before submitting the IHT400 (schedule IHT422).
- To claim the unused nil rate band of a spouse, PRs of the survivor must make a claim using schedule 402.  
- To claim the unused RNRB of a spouse, PRs of the survivor must make a claim using schedule 436.

### Paying IHT

- IHT on property without the right to pay by instalments must be paid within 6 months of the end of the month in which the death occurred. Failure to do so causes interest to become payable.
- Where property qualifies for the right to pay by instalments, no tax is due until the expiry of the first 6-month period. Interest runs on all tax not paid at the due date.
- Tax payable on the estate is apportioned between the instalment and non-instalment option property.

### Valuations

Assets in the estate are valued at ‘the price which the property might reasonably be expected to fetch if sold in the open market’ immediately before the death (IHTA 1984, s 160).

#### Jointly-owned Assets

Where the deceased was a co-owner of the land at their death, the market value of the land will normally be discounted by 15% (residential property) or 10% (investment property), to reflect the difficulty of selling a part interest in land.

The discount is not available for co-ownership of assets other than land. Where the co-owners of land are spouses/ civil partners, generally no discount in value is allowed.

### Funding IHT

Where there is tax to pay on delivery of an IHT400, the PRs must arrange for the money to be sent to HMRC. HMRC sends the probate summary (IHT421) to the Probate Service, so grant can be issued. Funding the tax bill may be difficult, since the deceased's assets vesting in PRs are 'frozen' until the grant issues. There are some options.

- Direct payment scheme
	- There is a procedure allowing PRs to arrange payment of IHT to HMRC directly from the deceased's accounts. The scheme is voluntary on the part of institutions.
	- Procedure:
		1. PRs provide identification to bank
		2. PRs complete and send IHT423 form to bank, as well as sending IHT400 and supporting schedules to HMRC.
		3. Bank sends money direct to HMRC.
		4. HMRC sends receipted Probate Summary (IHT421) to Probate Service.
	- This process is usually slow. Solicitors can make private arrangements with the bank, for the transfer of funds from the deceased's account.
- Life assurance
	- A life assurance company may be willing to release funds to pay IHT directly to HMRC.
- Assets realisable without grant
	- See Administration of Estates (Small Payments) Act 1965.
- Loans from beneficiaries
	- Wealthy beneficiaries may be prepared to fund the tax from their own resources, on condition that they will be repaid from the deceased’s estate once the grant issues.
- National savings and government stock
	- Payment of tax may also be made from National Savings Bank accounts or from the proceeds of National Savings Certificates/ investments.
- Bank borrowing
	- Banks will often lend against an undertaking to repay the loan given by the PRs, along with (often) an undertaking from the solicitor to repay the loan from the proceeds of the estate.
- Heritage property
	- Taxpayers can offer HMRC an asset in lieu of tax (IHTA 1984, s 230(1)). The Secretary of State must agree to accept such assets and the standard required of such objects is very high.
- Obtaining a grant on credit
	- The grant of probate can be obtained on credit in exceptional circumstances where PRs can demonstrate that it is impossible to pay IHT in advance.

```ad-conduct
An undertaking should be limiited to "such proceeds as come into the solicitor's control".
```

## Excepted Estates

### Inheritance Tax (Delivery of Accounts) (Excepted Estates) Regulations 2004

If the estate is excepted, PRs do not now submit any IHT form to HMRC. Instead, information  
as to value of the estate is included on the forms submitted to the Probate Service which the  
Probate Service must pass on to HMRC within one month.

HMRC has **60 days** from the issue of the grant of representation to ask for additional information. If no such request is made, the estate receives **automatic clearance**.

The requirements for qualifying as an excepted estate have been relaxed in response to the  
criticisms of the Office of Tax Simplification, allowing many more estates to qualify.

There are 3 categories of excepted estates.

| Category                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Category 1 - small estates           | Estates where the gross value on death for IHT purposes + chargeable value of any specified transfers does not exceed nil rate threshold. Nil rate threshold is increased to take account of any transferred nil rate band.                                                           |
| Category 2 - 'exempt' estates        | Estates where the bulk of the estate attracts the spouse/ civil partner or charity exemption. The gross value of the estate + specified transfers must not exceed £3 million. Net chargeable estate after deduction of liabilities and exemptions must not exceed nil rate threshold. |
| Category 3 - 'non-domiciled' estates | Where the deceased was never domiciled or treated as domiciled in the UK, and owned only limited assets in the UK.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

```ad-defn
title: Specified transfers
Chargeable transfers of cash, personal chattels, tangible moveable property, quoted shares, or an interest in land, made in the 7 years before death. When valuing specified transfers, business and agricultural property relief is ignored. 
```

```ad-defn
title: Specified exempt transfers
Transfers of value made in 7 years before death which fall under one of the exceptions:
- s 18 (transfers between spouses (or civil partners));
- s 23 (gifts to charities);
- s 24 (gifts to political parties);
- s 24A (gifts to housing associations);
- s 27 (maintenance funds for historic buildings, etc); or
- s 28 (employee trusts).
```

### Procedure

On the application of grant, PRs provide details of the deceased, the value of their estate and details of any nil rate band.

```ad-defn
title: Estate
For this purpose, estate means the total of the death estate + specified transfers + specified exempt transfers made $\leq 7$ years before death.
```

HMRC will select a random sample to review within 60 days of the application for grant.

## IHT400

Must be used whenever the deceased dies domiciled in the UK and the estate is not an excepted estate. PRs must complete Form IHT400 and relevant supporting schedules and sign a declaration of truth. Schedules required will vary according to the composition of the estate.

IHT400 required $\implies$ IHT421 (Probate Summary) must be completed and submitted alongside. Sets out the gross and net values of the estate for probation purposes.

- Probate value is not reduced by IHT exemptions and reliefs.
- Probate value does not include the value of the property passing by survivorship or under the terms of a trust.

HMRC will, if satisfied, receipt the IHT421 and forward it to the Probation Service. This is proof that the relevant IHT has been paid. HMRC recommends allowing 20 working days between sending the IHT400 and applying for grant.

## PA1P And PA1A

Applications for a grant of representation can be verified against a statement of truth and without the will having to be marked with the signature of the applicant.

| Is there a will? | Form to use |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Yes              | PA1P        |
| No               | PA1A            |

Online applications are made using one form, with different sections for the different options.

### Purpose of Application Forms

1. Establish basis of the applicants' claim to be entitled to take the grant
2. Confirm that PRs will carry out their statutory duties
3. Identify the will and any codicils to it.

### Points in Common

Both forms have sections for:

- Identifying the applicants
	- Name
	- Address
	- Identification documents
- Identifying the deceased
	- Name
	- Marital status at death
	- Total of foreign assets
	- Any legally adopted/ adopted out relatives.
- Applications as attorney
	- Common for persons to apply for a grant as an attorney on behalf of the person entitled to take out the grant.
	- Where no attorney has been appointed, a grant will be made to another person for use and benefit of the incapacitated person.
- Foreign domicile
	- To obtain a grant for a person domiciled abroad, extra information about the entitlement to take out a grant is needed.
- IHT estate and probate estate
	- Applicant must state whether an IHT400 or IHT421 was completed.
	- Provide details on excepted estate if relevant.
- Legal statements
	- Applicants confirm that the will & codicils is last will and testament of the person who died.
	- Applicants will collect the whole estate
	- Applicant will provide full details of the estate and how it has been distributed.
	- Applicant understands that application will be rejected if information not provided.
	- Applicant understands that proceedings for contempt of court will be brought if there is evidence of dishonesty.

## PA1P

Completed whenever there is a will, and irrespective of whether the grant sought is a grant of probate or a grant of letters of administration with the will.

- Identification of will
	- Original will, and any codicils must accompany the application must be provided.
	- Must include date of will, and details of any foreign wills.
	- Question of whether there are any minor beneficiaries (in which case two administrators must be appointed, if the application is by non-executors).

### Executors

- Entitlement of executors to act
	- Executors have the best right to take a grant of probate. One executor may obtain a grant and act alone.
- Executor lacking capacity
	- Capacity to act as executor is judged at the time of the application for the grant. A person appointed as an executor who lacks capacity to make decisions cannot apply for the grant.
	- In the case where all executors lack capacity, the court can intervene/ give executor power to the attorney/ give executor power to the person entitled to the residuary estate.
- Minors
	- An executor who is a minor at the testator's death cannot act as executor/ obtain a grant of probate.
	- If only a minor is appointed, a grant of letters of administration with will annexed for the use and benefit of the minor can be made (?)
- Spouse/ civil partner
	- If spouse appointed and marriage/ civil partnership fails, appointment will fail unless the testator has shown a contrary intention in the will.
- Renunciation
	- Persons appointed as executors may renounce their right to take the grant, provided that they have not 'intermeddled' (e.g., notifying the deceased's bank of the death).
	- Renunciation must be made using Form PA15, signed by the renouncer and filed with the Probate Service.
	- Executors also appointed trustees will remain trustees despite renouncing executorship.
- Power reserved
	- No limit on how many executors can be appointed
	- Probate will be granted to a maximum of 4 executors in respect of the same property.
	- No need for every executor to act.
	- Possible to obtain a grant limited to only part of the estate.

### Administrators

- Entitlement of administrators to act.
	- If there is a valid will but no executor able or willing to act, the appropriate grant is still letters of administration with will annexed.
	- The order of priority of person(s) entitled to a grant of letters of administration with will annexed is governed by **NCPR 1987, r 20**:
		1. Executor
		2. Anyone entitle to residue also holding it in trust for another
		3. Any other residuary legatee
		4. PR of any of the above
	- If there is more than one person of equal rank and they both apply separately, the court will prefer an application from a beneficiary with a vested, as opposed a contingent interest.
- Clearing off
	- A person in a lower-ranked category may apply only if there is nobody in a higher category willing and able to take the grant.
- Minors
	- A minor cannot act as administrator with will annexed, nor can they apply for grant.
	- Parent/ guardian may apply for a grant "for the minor's use and benefit".
- Number of administrators
	- Maximum of 4 in relation to the same property (s 114 SCA 1981).
	- If there are multiple people entitled to act as administrator, a grant can be made on the application of any one of them without notice to the other(s) (r 27(4) NCPR 1987).
- Need for 2 administrators
	- If there is a life interest or property passing to a minor, the court normally requires a minimum of 2 administrators to apply for the grant (s 114 SCA 1981).
	- But the court has discretion to only require 1
- Renunciation
	- Any person entitled to apply for a grant of letters of administration with will annexed can renounce in the same way as an executor (though using a Form PA16), except that an administrator does not lose the right to renounce by intermeddling.

## PA1P

Completed where the deceased died without a valid will.

```ad-statute
title: r 22 NCPR 1987
(1) Where the deceased died on or after 1 January 1926, wholly intestate, the person or persons having a beneficial interest in the estate shall be entitled to a grant of administration in the following classes in order of priority, namely—
- (a) the surviving husband or wife;
- (b) the children of the deceased and the issue of any deceased child who died before the deceased;
- (c) the father and mother of the deceased;
- (d) brothers and sisters of the whole blood and the issue of any deceased brother or sister of the whole blood who died before the deceased;
- (e) brothers and sisters of the half blood and the issue of any deceased brother or sister of the half blood who died before the deceased;
- (f) grandparents;
- (g) uncles and aunts of the whole blood and the issue of any deceased uncle or aunt of the whole blood who died before the deceased;
- (h) uncles and aunts of the half blood and the issue of any deceased uncle or aunt of the half blood who died before the deceased.
```

### Clearing Off

An applicant under r 22 must make clear that there is no one in a higher category able to apply for the grant (again, this is called ‘clearing off’) and describe their own relationship to the deceased.

### Beneficial Interest

Unless the application is made by the Treasury Solicitor or a creditor, the applicant must have a beneficial interest in the estate (or would have such an in interest if there was an accretion to the estate) by virtue of the intestacy rules.

### Minors

A minor cannot act as administrator and cannot apply for grant.

### Renunciation

A person entitled to a grant under NCPR 1987, r 22 can renounce their right to the grant in the same way as an administrator with the will annexed. If they are the only relative of the deceased with a beneficial entitlement, the grant will be made to a creditor of the deceased.

Common for a creditor to take the grant if the estate is insolvent.

### Number of Administrators

- The grant will issue to a maximum of four administrators. If there are more than four people with an equal entitlement, it is not possible to have ‘power reserved’ to a non-proving administrator.
- Where two or more people are entitled in the same degree, a grant can be made on the application of any one of them without notice to the other(s).
- A minimum of two administrators is generally required where the intestacy creates minority interests through property being held for minors on the ‘statutory trusts’.

## Effect of Grant

| Type of grant                                  | Effect                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Grant of [[Probate]]                           | Confirms the authority of the executors which stems from the will and arises from the time of death of the testator's estate. |
| Grant of administration (with or without will) | Confers authority on the administrator and vests the deceased's property in the administrator. Until grant issued, the administrator has no authority and property is vested in the President of the Family Division.                                                                                                                               |

## Limited Grant

A grant of representation is normally general. Can be limited:

- To a specific part of a deceased's property
- To settled land
- To a special purpose (e.g., for a minor's use and benefits).

## Death of PR

If there are several proving PRs administering an estate and one dies after taking the grant but  
before the administration has been completed, the surviving PRs continue to act. Where the death leaves a sole surviving PR, the court may exercise its powers to appoint an additional PR.

If a person entitled to be the PR (either as the executor under a will, or by virtue of NCPR 1987, r 20 or r 22) survives the deceased but then dies themselves without taking out a grant of representation, the AEA 1925, s 5 provides that their rights concerning the grant die with them.

### Chain of Representation

The office of executor is personal to the executor appointed by the testator in their will.  
Because it is an office of personal trust an executor cannot assign that office (although they can appoint an attorney).

```ad-statute
title: s 7 AEA 1925
(1) An executor of a sole or last surviving executor of a testator is the executor of that testator.

This provision shall not apply to an executor who does not prove the will of his testator, and, in the case of an executor who on his death leaves surviving him some other executor of his testator who afterwards proves the will of that testator, it shall cease to apply on such probate being granted.

(2) So long as the chain of such representation is unbroken, the last executor in the chain is the executor of every preceding testator.

(3) The chain of such representation is broken by—
- (a) an intestacy; or
- (b) the failure of a testator to appoint an executor; or
- (c) the failure to obtain probate of a will;

but is not broken by a temporary grant of administration if probate is subsequently granted.

(4) Every person in the chain of representation to a testator—
- (a) has the same rights in respect of the real and personal estate of that testator as the original executor would have had if living; and
- (b) is, to the extent to which the estate whether real or personal of that testator has come to his hands, answerable as if he were an original executor.

### Grant *de Bonis Non administratis*

In situations where the chain of representation does not apply because there are no successive proving executors, a *grant de bonis non administratis* must be obtained to the original estate.

It is issued in estates where the sole, or sole surviving, PR has died after obtaining the grant but without having completed the administration, and it relates only to the un-administered part of the estate.

Two requirements apply:

1. there must have been a prior grant of probate or letters of administration to a PR who has now died; and
2. the chain of representation must not apply.

## Caveats and Citations

Available to assist in a dispute over the right to take out a grant of representation to an estate.

### Caveats (NCPR 1987, R 44)

The effect of a caveat is to prevent the issue of a grant of representation. The person lodging or entering a caveat is called a ‘caveator’. A caveat might be used, for example, where a beneficiary believes the executor named in the will lacks the mental capacity to act, or where the validity of the will is questioned.

An application for a caveat can be made online or using paper form PA8A.

### Citations (NCPR 1987, R 46)

If the person initially entitled to take the grant refuses to do so and also refuses to renounce, the estate would remain un-administered and the beneficiaries would be left waiting indefinitely for their inheritance. In such circumstances, a citation provides a remedy.

| Type of citation                    | Details                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Citation to take probate            | May be used where an executor has lost their right to renounce probate by intermeddling in the estate, but has not applied for a grant of probate and shows no signs of doing so. Once cited, the executor must proceed with an application for the grant of probate. If they do not, the citor can apply to the court for an order allowing the executor to be passed over. |
| Citation to accept or refuse a gift | Standard method of clearing off a person with a prior right to any type of grant who has not applied, and shows no intention of applying, for a grant.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Alternative

If a person is unwilling to act as executor in the administration of an estate, it is often preferable to apply to the Probate Service under the Senior Courts Act 1981, s 116 for an order passing over that person in favour of someone else.
