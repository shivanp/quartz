# Succession to Property on Death

```toc
```

Many valuable assets pass independently of the terms of the will; and even if there is a will, the court may  
override its terms under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 if it concludes that reasonable financial provision was not made for a close relative or dependant.

## Property

An individual can provide for the disposition of their property on death by leaving a valid will. This includes property held in the sole name of the testator at the time of death and any share of property owned as beneficial tenants in common.

If an individual does not dispose of property by will, it can pass on death according to intestacy rules.

### Property Passing Independently of will/ Intestacy

| Property           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Joint property     | Where property held as joint tenants in equity, the property passes by survivorship.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Nominated property | Allows individuals to nominate what is to happen to certain types of funds after the nominator's death. Statutory provisions apply to deposits $\leq £5,000$ in certain savings banks/ societies. Nomination takes precedence over any term of the will to the contrary. |
| Insurance policies | A person can take out a life assurance policy expressed to be for the benefit of specified individuals (effectively a gift on trust). Can express the policy to be in favour of spouse/ children/ expressly write the policy in trust.                                   |
| Pension benefits   | Usually, a lump sum is paid to members of the family/ dependents chosen at the trustees' discretion. Common for employees to be allowed to write a letter to trustees saying who they would like to benefit.                                                             |

## Requirements of a Valid Will

```ad-test
title: Valid will
To create a valid will, a testator must have
1. the necessary capacity and intention, and
2. must observe the formalities for execution of wills laid down in the Wills Act 1837. 
```

### Capacity

Individual must be:

- Aged 18 or over
- Must have requisite mental capacity.
	- ‘soundness of mind, memory and understanding’ ([[Banks v Goodfellow (1870) LR 5 QB 549]])
	- Must understand
		- Nature of their act and its broad effects
		- Extent of their property
		- Moral claims they ought to consider.

#### Proof and Presumptions

The person putting forward a will (e.g.., the sole beneficiary) must prove all necessary elements are present. Generally, mental capacity presumed unless there is any sign of mental confusion.

s 3 Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 introduces a statutory test to determine whether a person has capacity to take a decision. This applies only to decisions taken under the Act by the Court of Protection on behalf of another.

### Intention

The testator must have both general intention (to make a will) and specific intention (to make the particular will now being executed).

#### Proof and Presumptions

The burden of proving the testator's knowledge and approval falls on the person putting forward the will.

- General assumption
	- A testator who has capacity and has then read and executed the will is presumed to have the requisite knowledge and approval.
- Exceptions
	- Testator blind/ illiterate/ not signing personally
		- Necessary to provide evidence
		- Usual to include a statement at the end of the will stating that the will was read to/ by the testator, who seemed to know and approve.
	- Suspicious circumstances
		- e.g., the will is prepared by someone who is a major beneficiary under its terms.

#### Conduct

```ad-conduct
Those regulated by the SRA are required to act with honesty and integrity and in the best interests of clients (Principles 4, 5 and 7). They must not abuse their position by taking unfair advantage of clients, and they must not act if there is a significant risk that the duty to act in the best interests of the client conflicts with their own interests. There is such a risk where someone prepares a will which benefits themselves or someone close to them.

It is therefore sensible for firms to have a policy of refusing to act where a client proposes to make a gift of significant value to a fee earner or member of their family unless the client takes independent legal advice.
```

#### Challenging

Where a testator with capacity appears to have known and approved the contents of the will, any person who wishes to challenge the will (or any part of it) must prove **force, fear, fraud, undue influence or mistake**, to prevent some or all of the will from being admitted to probate.

##### Undue Influence

- It is necessary to *prove* undue influence in relation to a will (no presumptions).
- For a lifetime gift made to a person in a position of trust and confidence, there is a presumption of undue influence to be discharge for the gift to be kept.

For a party to prove it has been the victim of undue influence, needs to show:

1. There is a relationship of trust and confidence, and
2. There is a 'transaction which requires explanation' (suspicious/ suspiciously high value).

##### Mistake

- Any words included without the knowledge and approval of the testator will be omitted from probate.
- If there is misunderstanding as to the legal meaning of words used in a will, mistaken words will not be omitted, but may be interpreted to give effect to the wishes of the testator.

#### Formalities

```ad-statute
title: s 9 Wills Act 1837
Signing and attestation of wills

(1) No will shall be valid unless—

- (a) it is in writing, and signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction; and

- (b) it appears that the testator intended by his signature to give effect to the will; and

- (c) the signature is made or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time; and

- (d) each witness either—
	- (i) attests and signs the will; or
	- (ii) acknowledges his signature,

	in the presence of the testator (but not necessarily in the presence of any other witness),

but no form of attestation shall be necessary.

(2) For the purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of subsection (1), in relation to wills made on or after 31 January 2020 and on or before 31 January, “presence” includes presence by means of videoconference or other visual transmission.
```

A will made on actual military service or by a mariner or seaman at sea is valid and may be in any form, including a mere oral statement: Wills Act 1837, s 11.

What is required for 'presence' is a line of sight ([[Casson v Dade (1781) 1 Bro C C 99]]) and a consciousness of what is going on ([[Brown v Skirrow [1903] P 3]]).

#### Remote Witnessing

s 2 allows remote witnessing for a limited period.

Must be:

- Witnessed in real time
- Witness and testator can be at different locations
- Electronic signatures not permitted. Testator must date the signature.
- Will must be taken/ posted to witnesses
- Witnesses must physically sign the will in the virtual presence of the testator.
- Witnesses will date with the date on which they are signing
- Execution process complete once both witnesses have signed.
- If testator dies before all signatures added - tough.

#### Proof and Presumptions

```ad-defn
title: Attestation clause
If the will includes a clause which recites that the s 9 formalities were observed ("attestation clause"), a presumption of due execution is raised. The will is valid unless there is proof that the formalities were not observed.
```

If there is no attestation clause, the district judge will require an affidavit of due execution from a witness/ affidavit of handwriting evidence from the testator/ will refer the case to a judge.

#### Witnesses

No formal requirements relating to the capacity of witnesses, though they must be capable of understanding the significance of witnessing a signature.

If either of the witnesses is a beneficiary under the will or is the spouse or a civil partner of a beneficiary, the will remains valid but the gift to the witness or to the witness’s spouse or civil partner fails (Wills Act 1837, s 15).

A solicitor preparing wills should give clear instructions on how to sign and witness the will. If the will is returned to the solicitor for storage, the solicitor is under a duty to check the signatures to see whether ss 9 and 15 appear to  
have been complied with.

#### Revocation

Testators can revoke a will during their lifetime, provided they have testamentary capacity. 3 methods:

1. By a later will or codicil
	- s 20 Wills Act 1837: a will may be revoked in whole or in part by a later will or codicil.
	- Normally, an express clause revoking previous wills and codicils is also included.
	- Exceptionally, the court may decide that an express revocation clause was conditional upon a previous event.
2. By marriage/ civil partnership
	- If testator marries/ forms a civil partnership after executing a will, the will is automatically revoked (s 18 Wills Act 1837).
	- Does not apply when the testator was expecting to marry/ form a civil partnership and appears not to intend the will to be revoked.
	- Where a civil partnership is converted to a marriage, the conversion will not revoke an existing will of either party nor affect any dispositions in the wills.
	- If a testator makes a will and is later divorced, or if a civil partnership dissolved, the will remains valid but
		- Provisions appointing (former) spouse/ civil partner as executor or trustee take effect as if they died on the date the marriage/ civil partnership is dissolved/ annulled.
		- Any property/ interest in property left to former spouse/ civil partner passes as if they had died on that date.
3. By destruction.
	- A will may be revoked by ‘burning, tearing or otherwise destroying the same by the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction with the intention of revoking the same’ (Wills Act 1837, s 20).
	- Physical destruction without the intention to revoke is insufficient.
	- Symbolic destruction (e.g., crossing words out, writing “revoked”) does not suffice to revoke the whole will, though if a part of the will is completely destroyed/ rendered unreadable, may revoke that part.
	- Destruction must be in the testator's presence and by their direction.

#### Alterations

Basic rule: alterations invalid unless it can be proved they were made before the will was executed/ unless executed like a will. Initials of testator/ witness in margin next to alteration sufficient.

## Mechanism for Effect

- People dealing with estate must decide the effect of the will in the light of the circumstances at the date of the testator’s death.
- If beneficiaries are referred to by description, they must be identified.
- Executors = appointed to deal with estate by will, administrators = deal with estate if there was no appointment in the will. Personal representatives = both.

### Property Passing

Basic rule:

```ad-statute
title: s 24 Wills Act 1837 - A will shall be construed to speak from the death of the testator.

Every will shall be construed, with reference to the real estate and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will. 
```

#### Ademption

A specific legacy will fail if the testator no longer owns the property at death. Gift said to be 'adeemed'.

If the nature of an asset has changed since the will was made, ask whether the asset has changed in name/form or substance. Change in substance → gift adeemed.

Suppose 'my car' is gifted in the will, but subsequently the testator bought a new car. Then generally the gift is adeemed.

```ad-defn
title: Codicil
A supplement to a will which, to be valid, must be executed in the same way as a will. A testator may wish to add to or change a will in a minor way and so may execute a supplementary codicil.
```

A codicil has the effect of republishing the will as at the date of the codicil. So the property referred to is the property at the date of the codicil (i.e., references to items in the will are references to the items on the date of republication).

### Testator Surviving Beneficiary

A gift in a will lapses if the beneficiary dies before the testator. If a legacy lapses, the property falls into residue, unless the testator has provided for the possibility of lapse by including a substitutional gift.

Where no conditions to the contrary are imposed in the will, a gift vests on the testator’s death. There is a presumption that, as regards people, a will is construed at the date it is made.

#### S 184 LPA 1925

```ad-statute
title: s 184 LPA 1925 - Presumption of survivorship in regard to claims to property.

In all cases where, after the commencement of this Act, two or more persons have died in circumstances rendering it uncertain which of them survived the other or others, such deaths shall (subject to any order of the court), for all purposes affecting the title to property, be presumed to have occurred in order of seniority, and accordingly the younger shall be deemed to have survived the elder. 
```

#### Survivorship Clauses

Commonly, gifts in will are made conditional on the survival of the beneficiaries for a specific period, e.g., 28 days.

#### Lapse of Joint Gifts

- A gift by will to two or more people as joint tenants will not lapse unless all the donees die before the testator.
- A class gift (e.g., "to all my nieces") does not lapse unless all members of the class predecease the testator.

#### S 33 Wills Act 1837

Where a will contains a gift to the testator’s child or remoter descendant and that beneficiary dies before the testator, leaving issue of their own who survive the testator, the gift does not lapse but passes instead to the beneficiary’s issue. Section 33 does not apply if the will shows a contrary intention.

(so if testator's kid dies before testator, gift reverts to grandkids).

### Other Reasons for Failure

#### Divorce/ Dissolution

Wills Act 1837, s 18A: where after the date of the will the testator’s marriage or civil partnership is dissolved or annulled or declared void, ‘any property which, or an interest in which, is devised or bequeathed to the former spouse or civil partner **shall pass as if the former spouse or civil partner had died’** on the date of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage or civil partnership.

#### Beneficiary Witnesses Will

s 15: if the beneficiary, their spouse or civil partner witnesses the will, a gift by will fails.

#### Disclaimer

Beneficiaries need not accept gifts given to them by will. If they disclaim the gift, it then falls into residue. A beneficiary who has received a benefit from a gift is taken to have accepted the gift and may no longer disclaim.

#### Forfeiture

Forfeiture Act 1982: A person is not able to inherit from a person they have been convicted of unlawfully killing (as a matter of public policy). Applies to murder or manslaughter (or death by dangerous driving), but not where the killer was insane. Unlawful killing includes aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the death of another person.

The court has a discretion as to whether or not to grant relief. There is a 3-month time limit to grant relief (s 3(2) Forfeiture Act 1982), starting at the point of sentence.

#### Estates of Deceased Persons (Forfeiture Rule and Law of Succession) Act 2011

Section 2 inserts a new s 33A into the Wills Act 1837 which provides, subject to contrary intention in the will, that a person who disclaims or forfeits an entitlement under a will is to be treated for the purposes of the Wills Act as having predeceased the testator.

#### Identifying Beneficiaries

References to “children” means only biological children and not step-children, unless there is sufficient evidence to the contrary. Adopted children normally treated as children of the adopted parents.

Persons who have obtained a full gender recognition certificate from the Gender Recognition Panel are legally recognised in the acquired gender.

```ad-statute
title: s 15 Gender Recognition Act 2004 
The fact that a person’s gender has become the acquired gender under the Act does not affect the disposal or devolution of property under a will or other instrument made before 4 April 2005.
```

But it will do if the will is made after that date. s 18 GRA 2004: where the disposition or evolution of any property under a will or other instrument (made on or after the appointed day) is different from what it would be but for the fact that a person’s gender has become the acquired gender under the Act, an application may be made to the High Court where expectations have been defeated.

Trustees and PRs are not liable for failing to check a gender recognition certificate etc., though a wronged party can still follow the property and claim it from other beneficiaries.

## Intestacy Rules

Intestacy rules contained in Administration of Estates Act 1925. Can apply when there is no will (person has died interstate), or only a partial will (partial intestacy). Applies only to property which is capable of being left by will.

### Statutory Trust

The intestacy rules impose a trust over all the property (real and personal) in respect of which  
a person dies intestate (AEA 1925, s 33). This trust is similar to the usual express trust found  
in a will and includes a power of sale by the PRs. The remaining balance is the 'residuary estate' to be shared among family (s 46 AEA 1925).

### Spouse/ Civil Partner

A spouse is the person to whom the deceased was married at their death, whether or not they were living together. Civil partners are treated in the same way as spouses. Former spouses excluded.

```ad-defn
title: Issue
Includes all direct descendants, as well as adopted children and remoter descendants. Step children not included. 
```

#### Entitlement

Where the intestate is survived by both spouse or civil partner and issue:

- Spouse/ civil partner receives personal chattels absolutely
	- Tangible moveable property
	- Excludes money, investments and items used mainly for business purposes.
- Spouse/ civil partner receives “statutory legacy” tax-free, and costs + interest from death until payment. This is £270,000.
- Residuary estate divided in half.
	- Half held on trust for spouse/ civil partner absolutely
	- Half held for the issue on the statutory trusts.

The intestate’s spouse or civil partner must survive the intestate for 28 days in order to inherit. The Law Reform (Succession) Act 1995 provides that, where the intestate’s spouse or civil  
partner dies within 28 days of the intestate, the estate is distributed as if the spouse or civil  
partner has not survived the intestate.

#### Applying Statutory Trusts

Statutory trusts determine membership of the class of beneficiaries:

- Primary beneficiaries are the children of the intestate who are living at the intestate's death
- Interests of children conditional on reaching 18/ marrying/ forming civil partnership before that age.
- If a child predeceased the intestate, any children of the deceased who are living at the intestate's death take their deceased parent's share equally between them, conditional on reaching 18 or marrying/ civil partnership before that.
- If children or issue survive the intestate but die without attaining a vested interest, their interest normally fails, and the estate is distributed as if they had never existed.
	- Unless they leave issue, in which case, issue may be substituted.

#### Appropriation of Matrimonial Home

- The spouse/ civil partner can require PR's to appropriate the matrimonial home in full or partial satisfaction of any absolute interest in the estate (Intestates’ Estates Act 1952, s 5).
- If the property is worth more than the entitlement, the spouse or civil partner may still require appropriation provided they pay the difference, ‘equality money’, to the estate.
- The election must be made in writing to the PRs within 12 months of the grant of representation.

#### No Issue

Where the intestate leaves a surviving spouse or civil partner but no issue, the whole estate,  
however large, passes to the spouse or civil partner absolutely. The spouse or civil partner must survive the intestate for 28 days in order to take.

#### Distribution Where No Surviving spouse/ Civil Partner

The residue estate is divided between:

1. issue on the ‘statutory trusts’, but if none,
2. parents, equally if both alive, but if none,
3. brothers and sisters of the whole blood on the ‘statutory trusts’, but if none,
4. brothers and sisters of the half blood on the ‘statutory trusts’, but if none,
5. grandparents, equally if more than one, but if none,
6. uncles and aunts of the whole blood on the ‘statutory trusts’, but if none,
7. uncles and aunts of the half blood on the ‘statutory trusts’, but if none,
8. the Crown, Duchy of Lancaster, or Duke of Cornwall (*bona vacantia*).

Each category except parents and grandparents takes “on the statutory trusts”, meaning the members of the class share the estate equally. Relatives not mentioned in s 46 may inherit on intestacy if their parents died before the intestate.

#### Adopted and Illegitimate Children

Adopted children are treated for intestacy purposes as the children of their adoptive parents  
and not of their natural parents. The intestacy rules are applied regardless of whether or not a particular individual’s parents were married to each other.

On the intestacy of an individual whose parents were not married to each other, it is presumed that the individual has not been survived by their father or by any person related to them through their father unless the contrary is shown, or the father is named on the birth certificate (Family Law Reform Act 1987, s 18(2)).

Upon adoption, vested interests of a child are preserved, and contingent interests may be preserved.

#### Bona Vacantia

Where an estate passes *bona vacantia*, the Crown, Duchy of Lancaster or Duke of Cornwall has  
a discretion to provide for dependants of the intestate, or for other persons for whom the  
intestate might reasonably have been expected to make provision.

## Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependents) Act 1975

I(PFD)A 1975 allows certain categories of people who may be aggrieved because they have been left out of a will, or are not inheriting on an intestacy, or are dissatisfied with the amount they are inheriting, to apply for a benefit from the estate following the testator’s or intestate’s death.

### Time Limit

An application must be brought within **6 months** of the date of issue of the grant of representation to the deceased’s estate (s 4), though the court has discretion to extend.

### Who Can Claim

s 1(1):

- Spouse or civil partner
- Former spouse/ civil partner who has not remarried
- Child
- Step-child/ child of cohabitee
- Person being maintained
- Person living in the same house as the deceased for the whole 2 years before death.

### Proof

The only ground for a claim is that ‘the disposition of the deceased’s estate effected by his will or the law relating to intestacy, or a combination of his will and that law, is not such as to make reasonable financial provision for the applicant’. Section 1(2) sets out two standards for judging ‘reasonable financial provision’.

| Standard                  | Details                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Surviving spouse standard (s 1(2)(a)) | Allows a surviving spouse/ civil partner such financial provision as is reasonable in all the circumstances. |
| Ordinary standard (s 1(2)(b))        | For other categories of applicant, allows ‘such financial provision as it would be reasonable in all the circumstances…for the applicant to receive for his maintenance’                                                                                                               |

So a person able to pay for their own maintenance will not obtain any award.

### Factors

s 3(1) provides guidelines of factors which the court considers:

- Financial resources and needs of the applicant
- Deceased's moral obligations
- Size and nature of estate
- Physical/ mental disabilities
- Conduct of applicant and anything else relevant.

### Orders of the Court

The court has wide powers to make orders against the ‘net estate’ of the deceased. The ‘net estate’ against which an order can be made includes not only property which the deceased has, or could have, disposed of by will or nomination, but also the deceased’s share of joint property passing by survivorship if the court so orders.

Any order taken into account for IHT purposes.

### Protecting PRs

Personal representatives should be advised not to distribute the estate until six months have elapsed from the issue of the grant. Must not distribute once they have notice of a possible claim. If PRs do distribute within the six-month period and an applicant subsequently brings a successful claim, the PRs will be personally liable to satisfy the claim if insufficient assets remain in the estate.
