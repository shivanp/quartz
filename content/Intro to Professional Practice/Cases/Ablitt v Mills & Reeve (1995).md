# Ablitt v Mills & Reeve (1995)

## Abstract

In the course of acting for Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society (NU), N, a solicitor with M, received seven files containing privileged information which had been sent in error by A's counsel. Relying on para.16.07 of The Guide to Professional Conduct of Solicitors (6th ed. 1993), N, once he realised that the documents were privileged, ceased reading them and sought further instructions from NU, who instructed N to read all the files and then return them to A. Subsequently M offered undertakings to A not to make use of information derived from the files, but refused a request to stop acting for NU in the action. A applied for an injunction restraining M from acting as NU's solicitors.

Held, allowing the application, that M had been able to gain an accurate perception of the view of A's advisers as to the merits of his claim, and to allow them to take advantage of such information would be contrary to the requirements of fairness and justice. Parties must be free to communicate with their legal advisers without fearing that such privileged information may be used by the opposing side (_[Ridehalgh v Horsefield [1994] Ch. 205, [1994] 1 WLUK 563](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I881E41C0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b866b7810c11484d89f1abcf4dd6861d&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered). [Per curiam: Paragraph 16.07 of the Guide to Professional Conduct contained an apparent anomaly in that it required a solicitor in the same position as N to stop reading, inform the other side and then return the documents, whilst also advising that, before returning the documents, a solicitor should consider whether to seek instructions from his client about the matter.]
