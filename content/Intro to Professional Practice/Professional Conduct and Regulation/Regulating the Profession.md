# Regulating the Profession

## History

- The SRA was created in anticipation of the Legal Services Act 2007. The Legal Services Board supervises the SRA's regulation of the profession.
- Since 2006, alternative business structures have enabled lawyers and non-lawyers to share the management and control of businesses providing legal services.
	- The SRA undertook a complete review of the regulation framework in anticipation of this.
	- Resulted in the SRA Code of Conduct 2011, replacing the Solicitors' Code of Conduct 2007
	- This was much shorter and less prescriptive – included more general principles
- 2014: SRA began a programme of reform → new simplified Standards and Regulations: the two Codes of Conduct.
	- Much shorter than the 2011 Code
	- New codes and regulations came into effect 25/11/19.

## SRA Standards and Regulations

- Apply to everyone regulated by the SRA
- Consist of Principles, the two Codes, SRA Accounts Rules and some others.
- 7 Principles which are mandatory and apply to all those regulated by the SRA
- SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors, Registered European Lawyers (RELs) and Registered Foreign Lawyers (RFLs) applies to individuals authorised by the SRA to provide legal services.
- Code of Conduct for Firms applies to all bodies authorised by the SRA to provide legal services. Indicates that a serious failure can result in the SRA taking action against the body itself as an entity, rather than just individual solicitors.
- SRA Overseas and Cross-border Practice Rules Part A (Overseas Rules) apply to regulated individuals practising overseas and authorised bodies with an overseas practice.
- Part B (Cross-border Practice Rules applies to European cross-border practice

## Complaints

Solicitor must establish and maintain/ participate in a procedure for handling complaints (para 8.2 Code of Conduct for Solicitors). Must ensure clients are informed in writing about

- Their right to complain about solicitor's services and charges
- How complaints may be made and to whom
- Any right to make a complaint to the Legal Ombudsman.

Information about complaints must be published on a firm's website (SRA Transparency Rules).

If a client complains and it is not resolved in 8 weeks, solicitor must inform client in writing about

- any right to complain to Legal Ombudsman and details of how to do this
- If complaints procedure has been exhausted:
	- That the solicitor cannot settle the complaint
	- Name and website of an alternative dispute resolution approved body
	- Whether you agree to use a scheme operated by that body.

The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) has approved a number of ADR entities.

## The Legal Ombudsman

### Details

- Legal Ombudsman for England and Wales ('LeO') became operational on 6/10/10.
- Set up by the Office for Legal Complaints under the Legal Services Act 2007.
- Deals with complaints against all types of lawyers.
- Replaced Legal Complaints Service
- Only certain types of client can complain to LeO, including individuals, small business, charities, clubs and associations and personal representatives/ beneficiaries of an estate.
- Complain must relate to the act/ omission of a solicitor, or to services they offered/ provided/ refused to provide.

### When Used

Can use LeO when:

- Complaint has not been resolved within 8 weeks of being made to solicitor
- LeO considers there are exceptional reasons to consider the complaint sooner
- LeO considers that in-house resolution is not possible

### Time Limits

Should be brought no later than:

- 6 years from act/ omission; or
- 3 years from when the complainant should reasonably have known there was cause for complaint.

But LeO has discretion to extend these limits to the extent it considers fair. A hearing will only be held where LeO considers that the complaint cannot be determined fairly without one.

### Resolution

A 'determination' will then be made and sent to the parties and SRA. Complainant can accept or reject this. May direct the lawyer to:

1. Apologise
2. Pay compensation (+ interest)
3. Ensure putting right of any error or omission
4. Take specified action in the interests of the complainant
5. Limit solicitor's fees.

Limit of £50,000 on total value that may be awarded in respect of (3) and (4) - though pay awards for the others are not limited.

### Possible Outcomes

| Complainant's response | Outcome |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accepts the determination | Determination is binding on the parties and final. Can be enforced in court by the complainant. |
| Rejects the determination | Parties free to pursue other legal remedies. |

The LeO can refer a particular legal question to court if unsure. If professional misconduct is alleged in a complaint, LeO will inform the SRA.

### Breach of Professional Conduct

- Professional misconduct primarily concerns breaches of the SRA's Codes of Conduct.
- Complaints primarily concerning a breach of professional conduct will be dealt with by the SRA.
- Role of the SRA is to protect the public. If the SRA is informed of alleged misconduct, it will investigate. The individual/ firm will be given notice and invited to respond with written recommendations.
- Statutory power to carry out intervention into a practice.

#### Enforcement Strategy

The SRA Enforcement Strategy sets out how the SRA will use its enforcement powers and what it expects of those it regulates. Approach to enforcement:

- Focus on the most serious breaches
- Take account of aggravating or mitigating factors
- Emphasise constructive engagement to support firms and individuals to achieve compliance.

The position of the firm and the individuals inside it will be considered when deciding who to enforce against.

#### Outcomes

The SRA may decide to do the following:

1. Take no further action with or without issuing advice or a warning about future conduct
2. Impose a financial penalty or written rebuke
	1. Max penalty £2,000 for solicitors and their employees, £250 million for licensed bodies, £50 million for managers and employees of licensed bodies).
	2. Since 2008, SRA has made regulatory decisions public.
3. Control how the firm/ regulated person practises
	1. Can impose conditions or suspend a solicitor's practising certificate
4. Refer the matter to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal
	1. Tribunal is independent from the SRA
5. Disqualify an individual from actin as a HOLP, HOFA, manager or employee of a licenced body.

#### Complaints About Professional Services Vs Negligence

Solicitor owes a duty of care in tort to their client. Solicitor breach + loss suffered = solicitor can be sued by the client for negligence.

For LeO to get involved, the client does not need to have suffered any loss – it is enough that services were not of a reasonable quality.

SRA and LeO have no power to adjudicate issues of negligence in a legal sense, but where there is overlap they can act.

#### Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal

##### Summary

Hears and determines applications relating to allegations of unbefitting conduct/ breaches of requirements of professional conduct by solicitors and others, including ABSs. Most applications to the Disciplinary Tribunal are made on behalf of the SRA, though people can also make an application to the SDT directly without going through the SRA.

##### Structure

- Established by s 46 Solicitors Act 1974.
- Members appointed by the Master of the Rolls
- Currently 45 members - about 2/3 solicitors
- Sits in divisions of 3 members
- Civil standard of proof.

##### Procedure

- Disciplinary Tribunal has the power to make rules governing its procedure and practice.
- Maintains a panel of solicitors in private practice
- No investigative powers

##### Application to the Tribunal

- Must be made in the prescribed form, supported by evidence
- Hearing date will be fixed where the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a case to answer
- Each party can be represented by a solicitor or counsel.
- Evidence given under oath
- Can call witnesses
- Decisions called 'Judgments' or 'Orders'
- Order takes effect once filed with The Law Society
- Where an application is made directly to the Tribunal, they can refer it to the SRA for investigation.

##### Powers

Can make orders including:

- Striking a solicitor off the roll
- Suspending a solicitor from practice or imposing restrictions
- Imposing an unlimited fine
- Reprimanding solicitor
- Requiring payment of costs/ contribution towards costs
- Restoring a solicitor to the roll

##### Appeals

Disciplinary Tribunal orders can be appealed at the Administrative Court.

#### Other SRA Powers

| Power | Details |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intervention | Aim is to protect client interests and money. Practical effect is that a practice is closed and practice monies vest in the SRA. Agent is appointed by the SRA to carry out the intervention. May also occur when a sole practitioner dies/ is unable to continue practising suddenly. |
| Delivery of files | To investigate complains, SRA has the power (s 44B Solicitors Act 1974) to serve notice on a solicitor/ recognised body requiring the delivery of a file/ documents in the possession of the solicitor to the SRA. Code of Conduct obliges solicitor/ firm to respond promptly. |

#### Powers of the Court

A solicitor is an officer of the court. So the court has jurisdiction to discipline a solicitor in respects of any matter before the court.

#### Negligence

A solicitor may be sued by their client in the tort of negligence, or for breach of contract. Firms must carry compulsory indemnity insurance against such actions.

##### Steps to Take

Code of Conduct states that solicitors and firms must be 'honest and open' with clients if things go wrong, and if a client suffers loss or harm as a result, matters are to be put right and a full and prompt explanation given.

If requested by the SRA, solicitor or firm must investigate whether anyone may have a claim against them and report back to SRA.

Generally, if a client says they wish to sue a solicitor, there will likely be a conflict of interest. Law Society guidance states solicitors should respond to complaints even if they believe the allegations concern negligence and a referral to the firm's insurance provider will be necessary.

#### SRA Compensation Fund

Maintained by the SRA under ss 36 and 36A of the Solicitors Act 1974. Governed by the SRA Compensation Fund Rules and exists as a discretionary fund of last resort (e.g., if money has been stolen or otherwise not accounted for as the result of an act or omission of those regulated by the SRA). Funded by mandatory contributions by all solicitors and SRA authorised bodies. Applications can be made where an individual/ organisation has suffered loss due to a defaulting practitioner's dishonesty/ failure to account for money they received.

The fund does not pay out more than £2 million/ claim (unless there are exceptional circumstances). For multiple related claims, the threshold is £5 million.

Where payment is made from the Fund, the SRA will seek to be subrogated to the rights of the applicant and can take proceedings against the defaulting solicitor to recover the amount paid.

Codes of Conduct impose an obligation on solicitors and firms to ensure clients understand the regulatory protections available to them.
