# Preparatory Tasks

## Task 1

Ways in which the actions of a trainee who is not properly thinking about the Principles and Codes might result in professional misconduct:

1. Accidentally disclosing information they are meant to keep confidential
2. Forwarding the wrong document to the wrong person, breaching confidentiality
3. Not disclosing that they have a family member working for a firm with an interest in the client's business/ a competing business/ a particular transaction
4. Not disclosing share holdings in a company which they are working for through the firm
5. Acting on information (e.g., buying shares) attained through work

## Task 2

[[Nazari v Solicitors Regulation Authority]]:

A solicitor was struck off for unlawfully using his son's blue parking badge. He used the badge on 8 occasions to park closer to work. The High Court ruled that the Disciplinary Tribunal was right to strike off Wahid Nazari and that he suffered no procedural unfairness.

## Task 3

1. Your client is accused of abusing children in the local area over a two-year period.  Your sister runs an after-school playgroup for children in the same street as the client's home.

In this case, disclosure is still technically a breach (para 6.3 Codes of Conduct), but the context will be a mitigating factor in the context of any disciplinary action. There is no requirement in law to disclose the information.

Raises principles 5, 7, 2.

1. Edward was driving his car when he was involved in a collision with a lorry.  He and his passenger, Simon, were both seriously injured.  The lorry driver is claiming contributory negligence by Edward, and an eyewitness supports this claim. Edward and Simon come to you for advice and ask you to claim compensation from the lorry driver for them both.

Despite the fact that at some point in the future there may be conflict between Edward and Simon (perhaps one of them would want to settle while the other would want to pursue the matter in court), they have a substantially common interest – claiming compensation – which is one of the exceptions to the rule that a solicitor may not act for both parties where there is an actual or potential conflict of interest (para 6.2).

Under para 6.2, to use this exception:

1. All the clients must have given informed consent evidenced in writing
2. Where appropriate, effective safeguards must have been put in place
3. The solicitor or firm must be satisfied that it is reasonable for them to act for all the clients.

Principle 7 is relevant: need to act in the best interests of both the clients (note this is always the case for conflicts of interest).

```ad-statute
title: para 6.2 Code for Solicitors
You do not act in relation to a matter or particular aspect of it if you have a [conflict of interest](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#conflict-of-interest) or a significant risk of such a conflict in relation to that matter or aspect of it, unless:

1.  the [clients](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#client) have a [substantially common interest](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#substantially-common-interest) in relation to the matter or the aspect of it, as appropriate; or
2.  the [clients](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#client) are [competing for the same objective](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#competing-for-the-same-objective),  
      
    and the conditions below are met, namely that:
    1.  all the [clients](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#client) have given informed consent, given or evidenced in writing, to you acting;
    2.  where appropriate, you put in place effective safeguards to protect your [clients](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#client)' confidential information; and
    3.  you are satisfied it is reasonable for you to act for all the [clients](https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/glossary/#client).
```

There does seem to be quite a significant risk here. One is probably going to claim from the other under contributory negligence. So probably shouldn't take them both on to start with. So not reasonable to take them both on.
