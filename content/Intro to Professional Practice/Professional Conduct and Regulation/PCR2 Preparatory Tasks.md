# PCR2 Preparatory Tasks

## Task 1

(a) Your client, Karron plc, has been sued by Lima Beana Ltd for £1.8m damages. You negotiate a settlement with Lima Beana Ltd's solicitors (LRA Jurgen & Co) under which Karron plc will pay £1.4m in full and final settlement of the claim. Karron plc has not yet put you in funds, but says that it will drop off a cheque. LRA Jurgen & Co has informed you that before their client will stop the next stage in the court proceedings, you must confirm to them by close of business today, that you “will transfer the settlement funds to the LRA Jurgen & Co Client Account within the next three working days”.

Risks and possible solutions:

- Reaching the next stage of court proceedings, jeopardising the settlement negotiated
- Try to amend the undertaking to say that you will make reasonable endeavours to transfer the settlement funds to them in this time.
	- But they may not agree to this.
- Get explicit confirmation from Karron PLC that they will deposit the money into their account within 3 days.
- Undertake on behalf of Karron plc and expressly disclaim personal liability.

Say that ONCE we have cleared funds, we will transfer them to you. Can specify a time, or it will be deemed to be a reasonable time.

Solicitors are not obliged to give an undertaking. Client will often pressure to give an undertaking.

(b) In court, the judge handling a case you are dealing with expresses surprise that a particular document is not available. You think that the document is in your office. You undertake to produce it that afternoon.

Risks:

- The document is not in your office. Then you have breached an undertaking, and are liable to the court as a result.
- Something happens which means you do not have time to retrieve the document and bring it back to court by the afternoon.

Solutions:

- Undertake reasonable endeavours
- 'I'm 99% sure the document is in my office'
- Give a longer timescale, 'by the end of the week'
- 'I'll try my best'

Maybe just undertake to go an look for it?

(c) You are negotiating the renewal of a lease on behalf of your client, a company that owns the freehold to the property. You know that your client’s board is keen for the lease to be granted as soon as possible. The tenant asks for part of the premises to be redecorated as a condition for agreeing to the new level of rent. You state that “on behalf of my client, I can undertake that my client will complete the redecoration before the new lease is completed”. You have no specific instructions on this point, but the client’s estate manager has previously told you that the property’s decoration badly needs updating.

Risks:

- The redecoration does not happen. Massive risk.
- Disciplined by the SRA about this.

Solutions:

- Don't give the undertaking
- Immediately just ring the landlord and ask
- Put it in as a condition of the rental agreement. So then if it doesn't happen, the negotiated agreement is void, and you don't open yourself up to personal liability.

I undertake to ask the client for this. May feel under pressure, but just don't give an undertaking.

(d) You are acting for the buyer of a property which is subject to a fixed charge. The seller's solicitor writes to you in the following terms prior to completion of the sale:

“_Our client undertakes to discharge the charge from the proceeds of sale_.”

Note that this is a completely standard undertaking for the seller's solicitor to give. But not with this wording.

```ad-tip
Why not just a contractual term of the contract with the seller? This is not as comforting as additionally having the binding word of the seller's solicitor. 
```

Purchaser pays the sale fees to the buyer's solicitor, and vice versa. This is standard practice.

Limited risks: you have the word of the seller's solicitor. Note though that specific performance is not available in this case; your client may end up with a house with a fixed charge on it and a damages pay-out. Going through all that litigation would also not be fun…

(e) The deadline for serving a witness statement on the other party to litigation was yesterday. You have not been able to get a signed copy from your client. You receive a telephone call from the opposing solicitor, who is furious that the statement was not served on time, and who threatens to issue an urgent application to the court. To calm him down, you tell him not to worry and that you will serve the statement by 10 am tomorrow.

Again, same risk of personal liability. An undertaking is binding even if it is oral. Similar principles: undertake on behalf of the client, set a different timescale, reasonable endeavours.

## Task 2

In each of the following situations, identify whether the client needs or needed the lawyer to carry out a regulated activity.

You will need to refer to the following requirements:

1. Are you in business?
2. Is there a specified investment?
3. Are you carrying out a specified activity?
4. Is an exclusion available?

You do not need to consider the s.327 exemption (for professional firms) in this question.

**(a)** Guy is a solicitor practising employment law. His client is a major retailer. In the waiting area, the client’s Human Resources Director begins a discussion about how shares in a very successful national supermarket are at their lowest price for a long time and asks what Guy thinks. Guy says he thinks those shares are a good buy at the moment.

Guy does not seem to be in business, as he is not acting for the client during this conversation. But there is some risk that the client (or the FCA) may perceive that he is in business. So during the conversation he should make clear he has no expertise and cannot give a professional opinion. Alternatively, just say he's unable to comment.

```ad-note
No matter how informal the situation, remember that the client will rely on your opinion. So make it clear when you are not competent. So if not competent to advise them on something, pass them on to someone else. 
```

**(b)** Kirti is a real estate lawyer. Her client is a company which is buying a commercial building, funded from its own resources. Just before exchange of contracts, Kirti advises the client’s estate manager that the searches reveal no reasons to pull out of the purchase. The client pays the deposit for the purchase to the firm’s client account, the lawyer arranges for the exchange of contracts, and then proceeds to pay the deposit to the vendor’s solicitors.

Kriti is acting in the course of business. However, she is not working with a specified investment and handling cash as a solicitor will not involve a specified activity.

Property/land/buildings not specified investments. So no problems here.

**(c)** Phoebe is a trainee solicitor. Jennifer Hunt, a client of the firm, wants to know what she can do with a substantial amount of money that Phoebe has negotiated in order to settle her claim. In Phoebe’s absence from the office when Jennifer calls, her secretary suggests using the firm’s booklet about the typical benefits and disadvantages of investing in various investments; the booklet refers to many investments including shares, cash bank accounts, national savings and unit trusts.

This is generic advice so is not the specified activity of advising.

**(d)** Jo is a private wealth solicitor. She acts as one of the trustees for a disabled teenager. The teenager needs funds for university studies. The trustees need Jo to contact a broker to sell some of the investments, government loan stock (gilts) and corporate bonds that are subject to the trust.

Jo is working in business and is arranging the disposal of specified assets. If she chooses the assets to be sold, then she will be managing. However, Jo is acting in her capacity as a trustee rather than as a solicitor, so she can use the trustee exemption.

**(e)** Clarence Riley is a client who needs help while overseas. Marlon is a partner in a firm of solicitors who, on Clarence’s instruction, prepares the documents needed to effect the sale of Clarence’s majority shareholding in a private limited company. The deal duly completes and results in the firm holding the £2 million sale proceeds in its client account. On the day of completion, Clarence begins a tour of the world’s greatest extreme sports locations. He will be away for a month and during this time will need Marlon to arrange for £100,000 of the sale proceeds to be transferred to a stockbroker, with whom Clarence holds an account, in order that the stockbroker can invest £5,000 in each of 20 different quoted companies (which are listed in an email from Clarence to Marlon).

Marlon is acting in business and arranging for the acquisition of specified instruments. As the stockbroker is instructed to act for the client rather than Marlon, he will not be dealing as agent. The exclusion for sale of a body corporate (takeover exclusion) covered the work on the sale of shares, and the authorised third person exclusion covers the reinvestment in shares. So Marlon is not carrying out a regulated activity.

```ad-note
In the assessment it will be clear which specified activity is going on.
```

**(f)** Tegwyn is a licensed conveyancer working in an SRA regulated firm. His clients have asked him to arrange the purchase of their new home with the assistance of a mortgage that they have chosen. The mortgage company needs Tegwyn to fill in the property details on the mortgage deed, obtain the clients’ signatures, and return it to the mortgage company. The clients’ mortgage broker recommended the mortgage, and they are happy with its terms.

The home is not a specified investment, but the mortgage is. Completing the paperwork and returning it to the mortgage company constitutes arranging. The authorised third person exclusion or the professional/necessary exclusion means Tegwyn is not carrying out a regulated activity.

Professional/necessary exclusion is for strictly necessary things. For things which are not strictly necessary, can attempt to use s 327.

If you pass both the general and specific test, you can make use of the exemption. Note that you are not allowed to be paid for such activities, but you can assist the client in what they've asked you to do.

If they gave you lots of work of this type, can try to get regulated. Can't be paid at all for a s 327 exemption type activity.
