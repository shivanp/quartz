# Confidentiality

## Introduction

```ad-statute
title: Para 6.3 Codes of Conduct
You [must] keep the affairs of current and former clients confidential unless disclosure is required or permitted by law or the client consents. 
```

- Obligation of confidentiality extends beyond obviously confidential information given to a solicitor by their client and includes all information about a client or matter, regardless of the source of information.
- Firms must have good systems in place – Code of Conduct for Firms
- Duty continues after the retainer has been terminated.
- Duty continues after the death of the client.
- Any breach of the duty of confidentiality will be a breach of professional conduct.
- Practical steps should be taken to safeguard the identity of their clients.
- Beware in particular about mergers and solicitors moving firms.

## Acceptable Disclosure

- Disclosure is permitted with the client's consent – take steps to ensure the client knows the exact purpose.
- Can also disclose pursuant to a statutory requirement in certain circumstances.
- Can disclose under a court order or police warrant.

In the following situations, disclosure is still technically a breach but is a mitigating factor in the context of disciplinary action:

- Client indicating their intention to commit suicide or serious self-harm
	- First ask for consent to disclose to third party
	- May decide to disclose anyway
- Preventing harm to children or vulnerable adults
	- No requirement in law to disclose this information, but personal conscience
- Preventing the commission of a criminal offence
	- If a solicitor is being used by a client to perpetrate a crime, duty of confidentiality does not arise (no confidence under common law)

## Duty of Disclosure

Where a solicitor is acting for a client, they must make the client aware of all information material to the matter of which the solicitor has knowledge (para 6.4, Code of Conduct). This is a personal duty.

### Limitations

There are specific exceptions:

- Disclosure of information which is prohibited by legal restrictions in the interests of national security/ the prevention of crime
- Client gives informed consent (evidenced in writing) to the information not being disclosed to them
- Solicitor has reason to believe that serious physical or mental injury will be caused to the client or another if the information is disclosed to the client
- The information is contained in a privileged document that the solicitor has knowledge of only because mistakenly disclosed.

### Confidential Material Received by Mistake

Occasionally, mistakes may be made, and confidential information accidentally sent to the wrong party. The receiving solicitor must immediately return the papers to the original solicitor without reading them ([[Ablitt v Mills & Reeve (1995)]]).

## Placing Confidential Information at Risk

A solicitor or firm must not act in certain circumstances, where the client has an interest **adverse** to the interest of another current or former client for whom confidential information is held, unless either of the exceptions set out in the Codes is met (para 6.5 of both codes).

### Material Information

For the purpose of s 6.5, the confidential information must be 'material'. This is information which is:

- Relevant to the client's matter; and
- Of more than inconsequential interest to the client

### Adverse Interest

Adversity relates to the relationship between two respective clients. A relationship is adverse if the clients are or are likely to become opposing parties in a matter. This includes both litigation and negotiation.

### When it is Possible to Act

When the same individual holds confidential information for one party which is relevant to another client, the solicitor will be unable to act for both clients unless the client to whom the duty of confidentiality is owed consents to the information being disclosed or the other client gives informed consent (evidenced in writing) to the information not being disclosed to them. This is regardless of any adverse interests between parties – since the duties of disclosure and confidentiality are **personal** to the solicitor.

There are some exceptions:

- Effective measures have been taken which result in there being no real risk of disclosure of the confidential information.
- A current or former client whose information is held has given informed consent (evidenced in writing), including to any measures taken to protect their personal information.

More likely that these exceptions will apply in practice wrt a former client.

### Effective Measures to Safeguard Information

Effective measures include information barriers (previously, Chinese walls). This could be achieved through separate teams handling the matters, separate servers and printers, information being encrypted and password protected etc.

They are not appropriate for small firms.

### Informed Consent

The client must consent after having understood and considered the risks and rewards involved in the situation. It is often not possible to disclose sufficient information about the identity and business of the other client without breaching the client's confidentiality; something to bear in mind. Generally, informed consent is only of use to sophisticated clients.

### Professional Embarrassment

A solicitor may still be obliged to refuse to act on the grounds of professional embarrassment. A firm should decline to act where the information which it cannot disclose would cause severe embarrassment to the firm if it came out.

The firm should also consider the Principles.

### Confidentiality and Privilege

Confidentiality is distinct from the issue of legal professional privilege.

| Principle | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Prevents a solicitor from disclosing any information relating to a client without the client's consent. |
| Legal professional privilege | Allows a solicitor to withhold specific information which they would otherwise be required to disclose (e.g., in court proceedings) |

Legal professional privilege applies to information between a solicitor and client, whether written or oral, direct or indirect.

Limitations are placed to prevent it being used as a cloak.

#### Legal Advice Privilege

One type of legal professional privilege is legal advice privilege, which applies only to information passed between the client and a solicitor acting in the capacity of solicitor. Documents sent to or from an independent third party are not covered by this privilege; 'copying in' a solicitor will not mean the information can be withheld. If the communication is made for the purpose of committing a fraud or crime, it will not attract privilege ([[R v Cox and Railton (1884)]]).

#### Litigation Privilege

May be claimed in respect of documents created for the sole/ dominant purpose of litigation which has commenced/ is contemplated. This extends to communications between a solicitor and third parties.

Anything said by a solicitor whilst speaking in court as an advocate is privileged, so a solicitor cannot be sued for defamation in such circumstances.

[[Three Rivers DC v Bank of England [2004] UKHL 48]] examines the limits of legal professional privilege. Privilege continues beyond the death of a client ([[Bullivant v AG for Victoria [1901]]]).
