# Lecture

## Admin

helen.dyer@law.ac.uk

Not examinable until end of the year.

2-hour MCQ exam, open book, goes towards weighting (not pass/ fail). Will also feature in other written assessments (5%).

You're allowed 2 ringbinders in the exam. So probably need to highlight and shit.

## Codes

- Overhauled 25/11/19.
- There are 2 codes: for solicitors and for firms.
- Additionally, 7 principles
	- These are vague
	- Codes flesh these out.

## Structure

1. Issue (Conflict of interest/ confidentiality etc.)
2. Code refs (Principles and paragraphs)
3. Set out provisions and apply to facts
4. Conclude.

Do it this way for all written questions.

```ad-note
Be specific whether you're talking about code for solicitors or for firms.
```

Key case about mistaken correspondence: [[Ablitt v Mills & Reeve (1995)]].

```ad-warning
Competing for the same objective company does not apply to takeover of a public company (see SRA glossary)
```
