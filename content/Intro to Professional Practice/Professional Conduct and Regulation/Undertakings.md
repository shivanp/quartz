# Undertakings

```ad-defn
title: Undertaking
A statement given orally or in writingk, whether or not it includes the word "undertake" or "undertaking" to someone who reasonably places reliance on it, that you or a third party will do something or cause something to be done, or refrain from doing something. (SRA Glossary)
```

A solicitor must perform all undertakings given by them within an agreed timescale, or if no timescale is agreed, within a reasonable amount of time (para 1.3 Codes of Conduct).

Even a promise to give an undertaking will usually be interpreted as an undertaking and will be binding on the solicitor concerned. Once an undertaking has been relied upon, it can be withdrawn only be agreement. A solicitor is not obliged to give or accept an undertaking.

## Why Necessary

Often given by solicitors to smooth the path of a transaction, and avoid otherwise problematic areas. e.g., avoids the need for advance deposits in some cases, since other solicitors will rely on the undertaking as just as good.

## Breach of an Undertaking

The terms of an undertaking are personally binding on the individual solicitor concerned. So if they fail to comply, they can be sued personally by the recipient. They will also breach the Code of Conduct and will be disciplined by the SRA. The firm may also be disciplined for a lack of supervision.

As there is an obligation on firms to maintain records to demonstrate compliance, and on solicitors to be able to justify their actions, firms and solicitors must maintain a system for recording undertakings that have been given and discharged.

## Oral and Written Undertakings

An undertaking is binding even if oral, though it is advisable to give them in writing. If given orally, it should be confirmed as soon as possible.

## Terms of the Undertaking

A undertaking is not a contract (no consideration). But arguably just as important.

### Wording

A previous Code of Conduct stated that any ambiguity in the wording of an undertaking would be interpreted in favour of its recipient. So take care drafting undertakings.

### Acts Outside the Solicitor's Control

Provided an undertaking which is wholly reliant on the action/ inaction of a third party should be avoided given the binding nature of such an undertaking. Could alternatively provide an undertaking to use their reasonable endeavours to ensure something happens. But again, don't give this where there is likely to be dispute over what constitutes reasonable endeavours.

### Undertaking 'on Behalf' of a Client

An undertaking may be drafted as being made 'on behalf of' the client. This will not prevent the undertaking being enforceable against the solicitor personally. It is possible to exclude personal liability, but in order to do so the solicitor must clearly and expressly disclaim personal liability.

### Timescale

Either agree a timescale or a 'reasonable' timescale will be imposed.

### Costs

Where an undertaking is given in respect of the payment of costs of another party, the term 'costs' will be implied to mean proper costs unless as specific amount is agreed.

## Client's Authority

A solicitor should ensure they have clear and express authority from their client before giving any undertakings. When such authority has been received, it may be withdrawn by the client any time until the solicitor has acted (even if expressed to be irrevocable).

### Change of Circumstances

An undertaking will remain binding if the circumstances change so that it is impossible to fulfil it, either wholly or partially. The recipient may agree to its variation or discharge. Good practice to always inform the recipient of any changes to circumstances.

### Enforcement

#### The Courts

The court is able to enforce an undertaking against a solicitor as an officer of the court. Firms are obliged to carry indemnity insurance to cover such claims. But the value of such claims may fall within the excess of these policies, leading to personal liability for the solicitor concerned.

A breach of an undertaking is likely to be a breach of professional conduct. SRA will generally not investigate a breach of an undertaking given to the court itself, unless the court reported the matter to the SRA.

An undertaking given by an incorporated law firm (limited company or LLP) is not capable of being enforced against the firm under the court's supervisory jurisdiction over solicitors as officers of the court, since such a firm has a separate legal existence. So the recipient would have to make a claim under contract, negligence or breach of trust. The firm can still face action for professional misconduct.

#### SRA and Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal

The Legal Ombudsman, SRA, and Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal have no power to enforce the performance of an undertaking, but may investigate the solicitor's conduct and impose disciplinary sanctions.

#### Liability of Others

In a firm, if an undertaking is given by an assistant solicitor and not honoured, there will be a breach of professional conduct by the solicitor and also the partners of the firm. So many firms have strict procedures about undertakings.

```ad-warning
Be super careful. If you make an undertaking to pay Â£100k from the proceeds of sale of a house, and the house sells for 90k, you are personally liable for the 10k. So draft the undertaking to expressly limit liability to the money received through the sale. 
```

```ad-question
Why not just have the client undertake to do something directly? And sign an undertaking/ contract to that effect?
```
