# Money Laundering

> [!defn] Money laundering
> The process by which criminals seek to alter or launder their proceeds of crime so that it appears that these funds come from a legitimate source. 

Solicitors are targets for criminals in their efforts to launder the proceeds of crime.

## Money Laundering Regulations 2017

The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/692) came into force 26/06/17 and repealed and replaced the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. Since been amended by the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019 and the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020.

The Regulations apply to persons acting in the course of businesses carried out in the UK, including independent legal professions (reg 8). The vast majority of solicitors' firms will be subject to the Regulations. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.

There is a requirement for the 'beneficial owners, officers or managers' of the firm and sole practitioners to apply to the SRA for approval under the Regulations, which will be granted unless they have been convicted of a relevant offence. These offences include any which involve deception/ dishonesty.

A firm is required to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing to which the business is subject.

Services provided by law firms most likely to be targeted by money launders:

- Trust and company formation
- Conveyancing and client account services

So firms need to ensure they have appropriate measures in place to address these risks.

### Nominated Officers and Reporting Procedures

- A firm is required to establish and maintain written policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the money laundering and terrorist financing risks identified. This is mainly about systems and risk assessment.
- A firm must have a 'nominated officer' (MLRO) to receive reports within the firm of any instances of suspected money laundering and to liaise with the National Crime Agency (reg 21(3)).
- Firm must appoint an individual from senior management to be responsible for compliance with the Regulations (reg 21(1)(a)).
- Relevant employees (those in compliance/ identification of money laundering) must be screened prior to and during the course of their employment to assess their skills, knowledge, conduct and integrity. (reg 21(1)(b)).
- Establishing an independent audit function to examine and monitor firm's policies adopted to comply with the Regulations (reg 21(1)(c)).
- Controls which enable the firm to 'respond fully and rapidly' to enquiries from law enforcement as to whether it maintains a business relationship with any person, and the nature of their relationship (reg 21(8)).

## Client Due Diligence

Firms carrying out relevant business are obliged to obtain verification of the identity of each of their clients ('customer due diligence'). This includes the following circumstances (reg 27):

1. If the client and solicitor agree to form a business relationship
2. Carrying out the occasional transaction that amounts to a 'transfer of funds' exceeding EUR 1000
3. Carrying out an occasional transaction amounting to EUR 15,000 or more, whether in one transaction or several linked transactions
4. Where the solicitor suspects money laundering or terrorist financing
5. Where the solicitor doubts the veracity or adequacy of documents or information supplied to verify client identity.

Verification must take place before a business relationship is established/ before a transaction is carried out (reg 30). Proof of registration must be collected before establishing a business relationship with a company. There are certain exceptions, e.g., if there is little risk of money laundering.

### Simplified Due Diligence

Simplified due diligence is permitted where a firm determines that the business relationship or transaction presents a low risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. If the transaction and client are eligible for simplified due diligence, the solicitor will not necessarily need to obtain information on the beneficial owners.

### Standard Due Diligence

Will apply to most clients. The solicitor is obliged to verify the identity of the client on the basis of documents/ information from a reliable source which is independent of the person whose identity is being verified.

- For companies/ trusts, take reasonable measures to understand ownership and control structures.
- For natural persons, need passports/ driving licences.
- For partnerships, obtain information on the constituent individuals (other than where partnerships are well-known reputable organisations with long histories)
- For companies, need to know:
	- Name
	- Company number
	- Registered office address and principal place of business
	- Proof of registration
	- Reasonable efforts to obtain constitution, names of board of directors
		- This will be helped by the obligation on a UK body corporate to provide certain information on request when it forms a business relationship with a firm.

The definition of a beneficial owner varies depending on the nature of the client.

> [!defn] Beneficial owner of a company
> For companies, reg 5(1) defines a beneficial owner as:
> - Any individual who exercises ultimate control over the management of the body corporate
> - Any individual who ultimately owns or controls more than 25% of the shares/ voting rights in the body corporate. 
> - An individual who controls the body corporate

This does **not** apply to a company listed on a regulated market, but does apply to LLPs.

> [!defn] Beneficial owner of a partnership
> Reg 5(3) defines the beneficial owner of a partnership as any individual who:
> - Is ultimately entitled to or controls $>25\%$ of capital/ profits/ voting rights of the partnership
> - Otherwise exercises control over the management of the partnership.

> [!defn] Beneficial owner of a trust
> Reg 6(1) says this includes:
> - The settlor
> - The trustees
> - The beneficiary
> - The class of persons in whose main interest the trust is set up
> - Any individual who has control over the trust. 

This is more thorough than for companies, since the trust does not have legal personality itself. Beneficial owners are those individuals who hold equivalent or similar positions to those set out in reg 6(1).

### Enhanced Due Diligence

Enhanced due diligence must be carried out where (reg 33):

- High risk of money laundering/ terrorist financing, identified by the firm/ information provided by the SRA and Law Society
- Client/ other party to transaction is established in a high-risk third party
- Client has provided false or stolen identification documentation
- Client is a politically exposed person (PEP), or a family member or close associate of a PEP
- Transaction is complex or unusually large
- Any other situation where there is a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.

A solicitor must take measures to examine the background and purpose of a transaction and consider whether it is appropriate to obtain further independent verification of the client or beneficial owner's identity or more detail on the ownership and control structure of the client.

A PEP is an individual who is entrusted with prominent public functions. They have been a focus for the Financial Action Task Force and other bodies because of concerns about using their political positions to corruptly enrich themselves.

Where a solicitor is dealing with a PEP, additional obligations are placed on the solicitor, such as having the approval of senior management to act for the client, taking adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and enhanced ongoing monitoring.

A solicitor is obliged to undertake ongoing monitoring of business relationships to ensure transactions are consistent with the solicitor's knowledge of the client (reg 28(11)).

## Training

Firms are obliged to train employees and agents used about money laundering (reg 24). Employees should be made aware of the law relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and data protection.

Where no training is given, may provide the employee with a defence under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

### Record Keeping

Keep detailed records to satisfy due diligence requirements. Records must be kept for at least 5 years from when the business relationship ends.

### Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

This Act made it an offence to be involved in money laundering. There are 3 offences that most concern solicitors.

### Arrangements

> [!statute] Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 328
> 
> (1) A person commits an offence if he enters into or becomes concerned in an arrangement which he knows or suspects facilitates (by whatever means) the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person.
> 
> (2) But a person does not commit such an offence if—
> 
> - (a) he makes an authorised disclosure under section 338 and (if the disclosure is made before he does the act mentioned in subsection (1)) he has the appropriate consent;
> 
> - (b) he intended to make such a disclosure but had a reasonable excuse for not doing so;
> 
> - (c) the act he does is done in carrying out a function he has relating to the enforcement of any provision of this Act or of any other enactment relating to criminal conduct or benefit from criminal conduct.
> 
> (3) Nor does a person commit an offence under subsection (1) if—
> 
> - (a) he knows, or believes on reasonable grounds, that the relevant criminal conduct occurred in a particular country or territory outside the United Kingdom, and
> 
> - (b) the relevant criminal conduct—
> 
> 	- (i) was not, at the time it occurred, unlawful under the criminal law then applying in that country or territory, and
> 	
> 	- (ii) is not of a description prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State.
> 
> (4) In subsection (3) _“the relevant criminal conduct”_ is the criminal conduct by reference to which the property concerned is criminal property.
> 
> (5) A deposit-taking body, electronic money institution or payment institution]3 that does an act mentioned in subsection (1) does not commit an offence under that subsection if—
> 
> - (a) it does the act in operating an account maintained with it, and
> 
> - (b) the arrangement facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property of a value that is less than the threshold amount determined under section 339A for the act.

This is drafted very widely. There is no requirement that the funds pass through the hands of the solicitor for them to be criminally liable. The maximum penalty is 14 years' imprisonment.

> [!defn] Criminal property
> A person's direct or indirect benefit from criminal conduct (s 340)

Criminal conduct is defined very widely to include basically all offences, including conduct internationally which is criminalised in the UK.

A solicitor does not commit an offence under s 328 if they make an authorised disclosure to the firm's nominated officer as soon as is practically possible. If the nominated officer decides to make a report to the NCA, they are unable to consent to the transaction proceeding until:

- The NCA consents
- The NCA does not respond after 7 working days (starting the day after disclosure)
- Where consent is refused, and 31 days have since passed.

A solicitor may seek to make an authorised disclosure whilst the prohibited act is ongoing. To avoid breaching s 328, they must satisfy s 338(2A):

- Disclosure made whilst the prohibited act is ongoing
- When the alleged offender began to do the act, they did not know/ suspect criminal assets
- Disclosure made as soon as is practicable.

A solicitor may also seek to make an authorised disclosure after the prohibited act is completed, but must have a good reason for their failure to disclose prior to their completing the act (s 338(3)).

#### Exception: Litigation

> [!important]
> In [[Bowman v Fels [2005] EWCA Civ 226]], the Court of Appeal held that taking steps in litigation and the resolution of issues in a litigious context were excluded from the scope of s 328. 

But the solicitor would not be able to take advantage of this exclusion if the litigation was a sham created for the purpose of money laundering.

#### Exception: Overseas Crime

A solicitor will not commit an offence where the criminal conduct occurred outside the UK and was not unlawful in the country where it happened. But this defence is not available where the offence would carry a sentence of $\geq 12$ months in the UK.

#### Acquisition, Use or Possession

> [!statute] Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 329
> 
> (1) A person commits an offence if he—
> 
> - (a) acquires criminal property;
> 
> - (b) uses criminal property;
> 
> - (c) has possession of criminal property.
> 
> (2) But a person does not commit such an offence if—
> 
> - (a) he makes an authorised disclosure under section 338 and (if the disclosure is made before he does the act mentioned in subsection (1)) he has the appropriate consent;
> 
> - (b) he intended to make such a disclosure but had a reasonable excuse for not doing so;
> 
> - (c) he acquired or used or had possession of the property for adequate consideration;
> 
> - (d) the act he does is done in carrying out a function he has relating to the enforcement of any provision of this Act or of any other enactment relating to criminal conduct or benefit from criminal conduct.
> 
> (2A) Nor does a person commit an offence under subsection (1) if—
> 
> - (a) he knows, or believes on reasonable grounds, that the relevant criminal conduct occurred in a particular country or territory outside the United Kingdom, and
> 
> - (b) the relevant criminal conduct—
> 
> 	- (i) was not, at the time it occurred, unlawful under the criminal law then applying in that country or territory, and
> 	
> 	- (ii) is not of a description prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State.
> 
> (2B) In subsection (2A) _“the relevant criminal conduct”_ is the criminal conduct by reference to which the property concerned is criminal property.
> 
> (2C) A deposit-taking body [, electronic money institution or payment institution]3 that does an act mentioned in subsection (1) does not commit an offence under that subsection if—
> 
> - (a) it does the act in operating an account maintained with it, and
> 
> - (b) the value of the criminal property concerned is less than the threshold amount determined under section 339A for the act.
> 
> (3) For the purposes of this section—
> 
> - (a) a person acquires property for inadequate consideration if the value of the consideration is significantly less than the value of the property;
> 
> - (b) a person uses or has possession of property for inadequate consideration if the value of the consideration is significantly less than the value of the use or possession;
> 
> - (c) the provision by a person of goods or services which he knows or suspects may help another to carry out criminal conduct is not consideration.

##### Adequate Consideration Defence

An issue may arise where a solicitor received money for their costs for work carried out for a client charged with a criminal offence, and there is the possibility that the money in question is criminal property.

The defence applies where professional advisers receive money for costs, but the fees charged must be reasonable. Returning the balance of money in an account to a client may be an offence under s 328 if the solicitor knows/ suspects the money is criminal property. In this case, an authorised disclosure must be made.

#### Failure to Disclose

A person commits an offence under s 330 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 if:

1. They know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds to know or suspect, that a person is engaged in money laundering; and
2. The information comes to them in the course of a business in the regulated sector; and
3. The information may assist in identifying the money launderer or the location of any laundered property; and
4. They do not make an authorised disclosure as soon as is practicable.

> [!statute] Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 330
> 
> (1) A person commits an offence if [the conditions in subsections (2) to (4) are satisfied.
> 
> (2) The first condition is that he—
> 
> - (a) knows or suspects, or
> 
> - (b) has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting,
> 
> that another person is engaged in money laundering.
> 
> (3) The second condition is that the information or other matter—
> 
> - (a) on which his knowledge or suspicion is based, or
> 
> - (b) which gives reasonable grounds for such knowledge or suspicion,
> 
> came to him in the course of a business in the regulated sector.
> 
> (3A) The third condition is—
> 
> - (a) that he can identify the other person mentioned in subsection (2) or the whereabouts of any of the laundered property, or
> 
> - (b) that he believes, or it is reasonable to expect him to believe, that the information or other matter mentioned in subsection (3) will or may assist in identifying that other person or the whereabouts of any of the laundered property.
> 
> (4) The fourth condition is that he does not make the required disclosure to—
> 
> - (a) a nominated officer, or
> 
> - (b) a person authorised for the purposes of this Part by [the Director General of the National Crime Agency,
> 
> as soon as is practicable after the information or other matter mentioned in subsection (3) comes to him.

Breaking this down:

| Term | Explanation |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective test | A solicitor will commit this offence even where they genuinely did not know or suspect a person was engaged in money laundering. So turning a blind eye is no defence. |
| Regulated sector | Most solicitors' firms fall within this category. |
| The information | The information obtained must be of some use to the authorities. So the solicitor must identify/ believe the information will assist authorities. Again, an objective test. |
| Authorised disclosure | A solicitor will be provided with a defence to s 330 if they make an authorised disclosure to the firm's nominated officer as soon as practically possible. |
| Reasonable excuse for non-disclosure | Reasonable excuse is a defence |
| Training | If not trained, employee has a defence against s 330 offence |

##### Confidentiality and Privilege

A solicitor is under a duty at common law to keep confidential certain information given to them by a client. This is referred to as legal professional privilege (LPP). Communications will be protected from disclosure if they fall within 'advice privilege' or 'litigation privilege'. But LLP cannot be relied upon where communication takes place for committing an offence.

A solicitor is not obliged under s 330 to disclose any information that comes to them as a professional legal adviser in privileged circumstances, or in relation to legal proceedings, whether contemplated or actual. Does not apply where the information is communicated for the intention of furthering a criminal purpose.

##### Overseas Defence

If the solicitor believes the money laundering is taking place outside the UK, and it is not unlawful in that country, they do not have to disclose anything.

##### Penalty

Maximum 5 years' imprisonment for s 330 offence.

#### Tipping Off

> [!statute] Disclosing a suspicious activity report (s 333A(1))
> It is an offence to disclose to any person that a suspicious activity report (on money laundering) has been made if that disclosure is likely to prejudice any investigation that follows such a report. 

> [!statute] Disclosing an investigation (s 333A(3))
> More general offence which is committed where a disclosure is made to any person that an investigation into money laundering is being carried out or contemplated, and that disclosure is likely to prejudice the money laundering investigation.

##### Defences

There are a number of defences to tipping off:

1. the person who made the disclosure did not know or suspect that the disclosure would prejudice an investigation into money laundering (s 333D(3) and (4)).
2. Disclosure is made to the client for the purposes of dissuading the client from engaging in the alleged money laundering (s 333D(2))

##### Penalties

Carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/ or max. 2 year prison sentence.

##### Regulated Sector

Above offences only apply to the regulated sector, though similar provisions are in effect for work outside the regulated sector under s 342.

#### Confidentiality

A solicitor is under a duty under para 6.3 Codes of Conduct to keep confidential the affairs of clients (and former clients) unless disclosure is required or permitted by law, or the client consents.

When making s 328 or s 330 disclosures, the legislation expressly provides that such a disclosure will not breach this duty and is permitted by law.

#### Criminal Finances Act 2017

From 30/09/17, Criminal Finances Act 2017 introduced the corporate offence of failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion. It applies to law firms as 'relevant bodies'.

This makes a firm liable for failing to prevent tax evasion by its employees/ other associated persons. There is strict liability for the offence: no knowledge or intention is required on the part of the firm/ senior management.

The only defence available is that the firm had reasonable prevention procedures in place (or it was reasonable not to have such measures). The penalty is unlimited fines and confiscation of assets. A firm-wide assessment of risk and internal procedures will be required.

Serious and extensive restrictions are imposed on those dealing with people or entities on the sanctions list. This covers all firms and imposes a requirement to inform the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) if it is known or reasonably suspected that a person is a designated person has committed offences under financial sanctions/ asset freezing regimes. If the firm still wants to act for the person, needs a licence from OFSI.

> [!summary]  
> (1) Money laundering is the process whereby the proceeds of crime are changed so that they appear to come from a legitimate source.  
> (2) The Government has introduced legislation to disrupt this process.  
> (3) Solicitors who undertake relevant business must comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/692).
