# The Legal Profession

## Professional Conduct

- Being a professional, the public must be able to trust a solicitor.
- Must be trusted to act in best interests of the client
- Must comply with general regulatory requirements such as Bribery Act 2010. Mostly the onus on firms is to have adequate procedures in place to prevent bad stuff happening.
- SRA produced additional rules and regulations
	- Breaching these has severe consequences, including being struck off

## Legal Services Board

- Created by Legal Services Act 2007
- Supervises the 'approved regulators' of the legal profession, including the SRA (and the Bar Council etc.)

## SRA

Established by The Law Society in Jan 2007. Purpose is to protect the public by ensuring that solicitors meet high standards. Governed by a board of 11 members, 5 of which are solicitors. HQ in Birmingham. Budget funded by practising certificate fee.

## Law Society

Representative body for solicitors in England and Wales. Founded in 1825. Lobbies the government about changes in the law, lobbies for better working conditions for solicitors etc.

- Membership is optional.
- Governed by a Council
- There are 54 local law societies around the country

## Aspects of Practice

Different ways in which law can be practised::

- Sole practice
	- Becoming less common (Westlaw and stuff is hella expensive)
	- Practicality: going on holidays without having to hire a locum.
	- Authorised in the same way as other types of firm
- As a recognised body
	- Legal services body (75% of managers legally qualified & non-solicitor managers approved by SRA) can apply for authorisation by the SRA as a recognised body.
	- Recognised forms include:
		- Partnerships
			- Classic law firm structure: partners and then everyone else. Some large firms have salaried and equity partners.
		- Limited Liability Partnerships
			- Instead of partners, LLPs have members, who share in the profits.
		- Companies
			- Incorporate under Companies Act 2006
	- Once authorised, a body is entitled to carry on all 'reserved legal activities' (except notary services). This is defined in s 12 Legal Services Act 2007.
	- The recognised body must have a Compliance Officer for Legal Practice (COLP) and Compliance Officer for Finance and Administration (COFA) and whom the SRA has approved.
- As a Licensed Body
	- The Legal Services Act 2007 also introduced alternative business structures, allowing non-lawyers to offer legal services alongside non-legal services. Also allowed non-lawyers to own and invest in firms providing legal services.
	- Eligibility: must be one manager authorised by the SRA or another approved regular. Must also be a licensable body (confusing definition).
	- Once authorised, a licensed body is entitled to carry out the same range of activities as a recognised body.
	- Similarly as recognised bodies, must have a Head of Finance and Administration and Head of Legal Practice.

### New Changes

New SRA Standards and Regulations 2019: solicitors allowed to deliver non-reserved legal activities to the public from within a business not regulated by a legal services regulator. So e.g., a big four accountancy firm could offer family/ employment law services without going through the full authorisation process, but would not be able to hold client money.

Further, individual solicitors can now work and offer legal services on a freelance basis. Will not have to maintain the same level of client protection usually required. Does not need to be authorised if:

1. Practice consists entirely of non-reserved activities, or
2. Any reserved legal activities are provided through an authorised body/ authorised non-SRA firm.

### Employed Solicitors

This is a solicitor who is employed by a non-legal services employer (i.e., in-house counsel). Subject to same rules as lawyers in private practice.

### Registered European Lawyers and Registered Foreign Lawyers

Foreign lawyers who want to become managers owners of law firms authorised by the SRA must become RFLs. RELs are no longer a thing after Brexit, apart from the Swiss until 2024. These classifications allow foreign lawyers to provide all unreserved legal services, and some reserved legal services.

### Law Centres

There are 43 of them nationwide. Provide free legal advice to disadvantaged individuals within communities. Must take out appropriate indemnity insurance.

### Legal Advice Centres

No casework is undertaken, but legal advice provided. ULaw and BPP run their own.

### Duty Solicitor Schemes

Police station duty solicitor scheme aims to provide advice and assistance to people at police stations who would otherwise not be legally represented The court duty solicitor scheme aims to provide emergency legal representation at magistrates' courts on a rota basis. Fees for both cases are paid by the Legal Aid Agency to contracted solicitors.

# Regulating the Profession

## History

- The SRA was created in anticipation of the Legal Services Act 2007. The Legal Services Board supervises the SRA's regulation of the profession.
- Since 2006, alternative business structures have enabled lawyers and non-lawyers to share the management and control of businesses providing legal services.
	- The SRA undertook a complete review of the regulation framework in anticipation of this.
	- Resulted in the SRA Code of Conduct 2011, replacing the Solicitors' Code of Conduct 2007
	- This was much shorter and less prescriptive – included more general principles
- 2014: SRA began a programme of reform → new simplified Standards and Regulations: the two Codes of Conduct.
	- Much shorter than the 2011 Code
	- New codes and regulations came into effect 25/11/19.

## SRA Standards and Regulations

- Apply to everyone regulated by the SRA
- Consist of Principles, the two Codes, SRA Accounts Rules and some others.
- 7 Principles which are mandatory and apply to all those regulated by the SRA
- SRA Code of Conduct for Solicitors, Registered European Lawyers (RELs) and Registered Foreign Lawyers (RFLs) applies to individuals authorised by the SRA to provide legal services.
- Code of Conduct for Firms applies to all bodies authorised by the SRA to provide legal services. Indicates that a serious failure can result in the SRA taking action against the body itself as an entity, rather than just individual solicitors.
- SRA Overseas and Cross-border Practice Rules Part A (Overseas Rules) apply to regulated individuals practising overseas and authorised bodies with an overseas practice.
- Part B (Cross-border Practice Rules applies to European cross-border practice

## Complaints

Solicitor must establish and maintain/ participate in a procedure for handling complaints (para 8.2 Code of Conduct for Solicitors). Must ensure clients are informed in writing about

- Their right to complain about solicitor's services and charges
- How complaints may be made and to whom
- Any right to make a complaint to the Legal Ombudsman.

Information about complaints must be published on a firm's website (SRA Transparency Rules).

If a client complains and it is not resolved in 8 weeks, solicitor must inform client in writing about

- any right to complain to Legal Ombudsman and details of how to do this
- If complaints procedure has been exhausted:
	- That the solicitor cannot settle the complaint
	- Name and website of an alternative dispute resolution approved body
	- Whether you agree to use a scheme operated by that body.

The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) has approved a number of ADR entities.

## The Legal Ombudsman

### Details

- Legal Ombudsman for England and Wales ('LeO') became operational on 6/10/10.
- Set up by the Office for Legal Complaints under the Legal Services Act 2007.
- Deals with complaints against all types of lawyers.
- Replaced Legal Complaints Service
- Only certain types of client can complain to LeO, including individuals, small business, charities, clubs and associations and personal representatives/ beneficiaries of an estate.
- Complain must relate to the act/ omission of a solicitor, or to services they offered/ provided/ refused to provide.

### When Used

Can use LeO when:

- Complaint has not been resolved within 8 weeks of being made to solicitor
- LeO considers there are exceptional reasons to consider the complaint sooner
- LeO considers that in-house resolution is not possible

### Time Limits

Should be brought no later than:

- 6 years from act/ omission; or
- 3 years from when the complainant should reasonably have known there was cause for complaint.

But LeO has discretion to extend these limits to the extent it considers fair. A hearing will only be held where LeO considers that the complaint cannot be determined fairly without one.

### Resolution

A 'determination' will then be made and sent to the parties and SRA. Complainant can accept or reject this. May direct the lawyer to:

1. Apologise
2. Pay compensation (+ interest)
3. Ensure putting right of any error or omission
4. Take specified action in the interests of the complainant
5. Limit solicitor's fees.

Limit of £50,000 on total value that may be awarded in respect of (3) and (4) - though pay awards for the others are not limited.

### Possible Outcomes

| Complainant's response | Outcome |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accepts the determination | Determination is binding on the parties and final. Can be enforced in court by the complainant. |
| Rejects the determination | Parties free to pursue other legal remedies. |

The LeO can refer a particular legal question to court if unsure. If professional misconduct is alleged in a complaint, LeO will inform the SRA.

### Breach of Professional Conduct

- Professional misconduct primarily concerns breaches of the SRA's Codes of Conduct.
- Complaints primarily concerning a breach of professional conduct will be dealt with by the SRA.
- Role of the SRA is to protect the public. If the SRA is informed of alleged misconduct, it will investigate. The individual/ firm will be given notice and invited to respond with written recommendations.
- Statutory power to carry out intervention into a practice.

#### Enforcement Strategy

The SRA Enforcement Strategy sets out how the SRA will use its enforcement powers and what it expects of those it regulates. Approach to enforcement:

- Focus on the most serious breaches
- Take account of aggravating or mitigating factors
- Emphasise constructive engagement to support firms and individuals to achieve compliance.

The position of the firm and the individuals inside it will be considered when deciding who to enforce against.

#### Outcomes

The SRA may decide to do the following:

1. Take no further action with or without issuing advice or a warning about future conduct
2. Impose a financial penalty or written rebuke
	1. Max penalty £2,000 for solicitors and their employees, £250 million for licensed bodies, £50 million for managers and employees of licensed bodies).
	2. Since 2008, SRA has made regulatory decisions public.
3. Control how the firm/ regulated person practises
	1. Can impose conditions or suspend a solicitor's practising certificate
4. Refer the matter to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal
	1. Tribunal is independent from the SRA
5. Disqualify an individual from actin as a HOLP, HOFA, manager or employee of a licenced body.

#### Complaints About Professional Services Vs Negligence

Solicitor owes a duty of care in tort to their client. Solicitor breach + loss suffered = solicitor can be sued by the client for negligence.

For LeO to get involved, the client does not need to have suffered any loss – it is enough that services were not of a reasonable quality.

SRA and LeO have no power to adjudicate issues of negligence in a legal sense, but where there is overlap they can act.

#### Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal

##### Summary

Hears and determines applications relating to allegations of unbefitting conduct/ breaches of requirements of professional conduct by solicitors and others, including ABSs. Most applications to the Disciplinary Tribunal are made on behalf of the SRA, though people can also make an application to the SDT directly without going through the SRA.

##### Structure

- Established by s 46 Solicitors Act 1974.
- Members appointed by the Master of the Rolls
- Currently 45 members - about 2/3 solicitors
- Sits in divisions of 3 members
- Civil standard of proof.

##### Procedure

- Disciplinary Tribunal has the power to make rules governing its procedure and practice.
- Maintains a panel of solicitors in private practice
- No investigative powers

##### Application to the Tribunal

- Must be made in the prescribed form, supported by evidence
- Hearing date will be fixed where the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a case to answer
- Each party can be represented by a solicitor or counsel.
- Evidence given under oath
- Can call witnesses
- Decisions called 'Judgments' or 'Orders'
- Order takes effect once filed with The Law Society
- Where an application is made directly to the Tribunal, they can refer it to the SRA for investigation.

##### Powers

Can make orders including:

- Striking a solicitor off the roll
- Suspending a solicitor from practice or imposing restrictions
- Imposing an unlimited fine
- Reprimanding solicitor
- Requiring payment of costs/ contribution towards costs
- Restoring a solicitor to the roll

##### Appeals

Disciplinary Tribunal orders can be appealed at the Administrative Court.

#### Other SRA Powers

| Power | Details |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intervention | Aim is to protect client interests and money. Practical effect is that a practice is closed and practice monies vest in the SRA. Agent is appointed by the SRA to carry out the intervention. May also occur when a sole practitioner dies/ is unable to continue practising suddenly. |
| Delivery of files | To investigate complains, SRA has the power (s 44B Solicitors Act 1974) to serve notice on a solicitor/ recognised body requiring the delivery of a file/ documents in the possession of the solicitor to the SRA. Code of Conduct obliges solicitor/ firm to respond promptly. |

#### Powers of the Court

A solicitor is an officer of the court. So the court has jurisdiction to discipline a solicitor in respects of any matter before the court.

#### Negligence

A solicitor may be sued by their client in the tort of negligence, or for breach of contract. Firms must carry compulsory indemnity insurance against such actions.

##### Steps to Take

Code of Conduct states that solicitors and firms must be 'honest and open' with clients if things go wrong, and if a client suffers loss or harm as a result, matters are to be put right and a full and prompt explanation given.

If requested by the SRA, solicitor or firm must investigate whether anyone may have a claim against them and report back to SRA.

Generally, if a client says they wish to sue a solicitor, there will likely be a conflict of interest. Law Society guidance states solicitors should respond to complaints even if they believe the allegations concern negligence and a referral to the firm's insurance provider will be necessary.

#### SRA Compensation Fund

Maintained by the SRA under ss 36 and 36A of the Solicitors Act 1974. Governed by the SRA Compensation Fund Rules and exists as a discretionary fund of last resort (e.g., if money has been stolen or otherwise not accounted for as the result of an act or omission of those regulated by the SRA). Funded by mandatory contributions by all solicitors and SRA authorised bodies. Applications can be made where an individual/ organisation has suffered loss due to a defaulting practitioner's dishonesty/ failure to account for money they received.

The fund does not pay out more than £2 million/ claim (unless there are exceptional circumstances). For multiple related claims, the threshold is £5 million.

Where payment is made from the Fund, the SRA will seek to be subrogated to the rights of the applicant and can take proceedings against the defaulting solicitor to recover the amount paid.

Codes of Conduct impose an obligation on solicitors and firms to ensure clients understand the regulatory protections available to them.

```ad-summary
(1) The SRA is em powered by the Solicitors Act 1974 to publish rules and requirements  
for the regulation of conduct of solicitors, recog nised/licensed bodies, m embers of recognised/licensed bodies, and em ployees of recognis ed/licens ed bodies/sole  
practices.  
(2) These rules and requirements are enforced by the SRA and the Leg al Ombudsm an.  
(3) The SRA deals with breaches of the requirements of professional conduct, whereas the Legal Ombudsm an primarily deals with com plaints about services provided by legal practitioners, including solicitors.
(4) The Legal Ombudsm an deals with com plaints relating to an act/om iss ion by a legal practitioner and which relates to services provided by the practitioner. The client does not need to suffer any loss as a result of the service provide d in order to raise the issue.  
(5) The SRA may impose disciplinary sanctions for a breach of the requirem ents of  
professional conduct, or in serious cas es may refer the m atter to the Solicitors  
Disciplinary Tribunal.  
(6) The Legal Ombudsman has num erous sanctions at its disposal. These include  
directing the solicitor to limit their fees, or directing the solicitor to com pensate the client up to £50,000. The SRA/Legal Ombudsman has no power to pay  
compensation to the client itself.  
(7) The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal m ay fine a solicitor, suspend the solicitor or, as an ultim ate sanction, strike the solicitor of f the roll.  
(8) A solicitor will be negligent if they breach a duty of care to their client and  
foreseeable loss results as a consequence of that breach. Where the solicitor has  
been negligent, they may be sued by the client for damages.  
(9) The SRA Compensation Fund is maintained by the SRA. Payment m ay be made from  
the Fund when a client has suffered loss as a result of a defaulting practitioner’s act or om iss ion or to cover claims against uninsured firms.

# SRA Principles

## Introduction

The profession is regulated by the Government, the FCA and the SRA. The SRA Principles are all-pervasive and underpin all the SRA's regulatory arrangements.

The Principles are mandatory and aply to all individuals and bodies regulated by the SRA. They apply outside of a solicitor's practice as well as within it.

## 1. Justice and the Rule of Law

Principle 1 provides that a soolicitor must act in a way that upholds the constitutional rule of law and proper administration of justice.

## 2. Public Trust

A solicitor must act in a way that upholds public trust and confidence in the solicitors' profession and in legal services. A solicitor may breach Principle 2 through behaviour outside their solicitors' practice (e.g., getting a criminal conviction).

## 3. Independence

A solicitor must act with independence. This includes indepedence from the client - need to be mindful of their wider obligations to the profession as a whole.

## 4. Honesty

Where a solicitor is convicted of an offence involving dishonesty, likely that they will be struck off the roll of solicitors. The standard of honesty required for solicitors is that they may be 'trusted to the ends of the earth' ([[Bolton v Law Society [1993] EWCA Civ 32]]).

## 5. Integrity

A solicitor must act with integrity; they are in a position of trust. The concept of integrity is wider than just dishonesty - refers to the higher standards which society expects of a professional.

## 6. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion

Solicitors and firms must act in a way that encourages equality, diversity and inclusion.

```ad-example
- Making reasonable adjustments for disabled clients
- Treating employees fairly
- Having processes in place to deal with bullying, harassment and discrimination.
```

## 7. Best Interests of the Client

A solicitor must act in the best interests of each client. Derives from the common law and the fiduciary relationship.

This includes ensuring clients are provided with a proper standard of service in terms of client care, competence and standard of work.

# Confidentiality

## Introduction

```ad-statute
title: Para 6.3 Codes of Conduct
You [must] keep the affairs of current and former clients confidential unless disclosure is required or permitted by law or the client consents. 
```

- Obligation of confidentiality extends beyond obviously confidential information given to a solicitor by their client and includes all information about a client or matter, regardless of the source of information.
- Firms must have good systems in place – Code of Conduct for Firms
- Duty continues after the retainer has been terminated.
- Duty continues after the death of the client.
- Any breach of the duty of confidentiality will be a breach of professional conduct.
- Practical steps should be taken to safeguard the identity of their clients.
- Beware in particular about mergers and solicitors moving firms.

## Acceptable Disclosure

- Disclosure is permitted with the client's consent – take steps to ensure the client knows the exact purpose.
- Can also disclose pursuant to a statutory requirement in certain circumstances.
- Can disclose under a court order or police warrant.

In the following situations, disclosure is still technically a breach but is a mitigating factor in the context of disciplinary action:

- Client indicating their intention to commit suicide or serious self-harm
	- First ask for consent to disclose to third party
	- May decide to disclose anyway
- Preventing harm to children or vulnerable adults
	- No requirement in law to disclose this information, but personal conscience
- Preventing the commission of a criminal offence
	- If a solicitor is being used by a client to perpetrate a crime, duty of confidentiality does not arise (no confidence under common law)

## Duty of Disclosure

Where a solicitor is acting for a client, they must make the client aware of all information material to the matter of which the solicitor has knowledge (para 6.4, Code of Conduct). This is a personal duty.

### Limitations

There are specific exceptions:

- Disclosure of information which is prohibited by legal restrictions in the interests of national security/ the prevention of crime
- Client gives informed consent (evidenced in writing) to the information not being disclosed to them
- Solicitor has reason to believe that serious physical or mental injury will be caused to the client or another if the information is disclosed to the client
- The information is contained in a privileged document that the solicitor has knowledge of only because mistakenly disclosed.

### Confidential Material Received by Mistake

Occasionally, mistakes may be made, and confidential information accidentally sent to the wrong party. The receiving solicitor must immediately return the papers to the original solicitor without reading them ([[Ablitt v Mills & Reeve (1995)]]).

## Placing Confidential Information at Risk

A solicitor or firm must not act in certain circumstances, where the client has an interest **adverse** to the interest of another current or former client for whom confidential information is held, unless either of the exceptions set out in the Codes is met (para 6.5 of both codes).

### Material Information

For the purpose of s 6.5, the confidential information must be 'material'. This is information which is:

- Relevant to the client's matter; and
- Of more than inconsequential interest to the client

### Adverse Interest

Adversity relates to the relationship between two respective clients. A relationship is adverse if the clients are or are likely to become opposing parties in a matter. This includes both litigation and negotiation.

### When it is Possible to Act

When the same individual holds confidential information for one party which is relevant to another client, the solicitor will be unable to act for both clients unless the client to whom the duty of confidentiality is owed consents to the information being disclosed or the other client gives informed consent (evidenced in writing) to the information not being disclosed to them. This is regardless of any adverse interests between parties – since the duties of disclosure and confidentiality are **personal** to the solicitor.

There are some exceptions:

- Effective measures have been taken which result in there being no real risk of disclosure of the confidential information.
- A current or former client whose information is held has given informed consent (evidenced in writing), including to any measures taken to protect their personal information.

More likely that these exceptions will apply in practice wrt a former client.

### Effective Measures to Safeguard Information

Effective measures include information barriers (previously, Chinese walls). This could be achieved through separate teams handling the matters, separate servers and printers, information being encrypted and password protected etc.

They are not appropriate for small firms.

### Informed Consent

The client must consent after having understood and considered the risks and rewards involved in the situation. It is often not possible to disclose sufficient information about the identity and business of the other client without breaching the client's confidentiality; something to bear in mind. Generally, informed consent is only of use to sophisticated clients.

### Professional Embarrassment

A solicitor may still be obliged to refuse to act on the grounds of professional embarrassment. A firm should decline to act where the information which it cannot disclose would cause severe embarrassment to the firm if it came out.

The firm should also consider the Principles.

### Confidentiality and Privilege

Confidentiality is distinct from the issue of legal professional privilege.

| Principle | Description |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | Prevents a solicitor from disclosing any information relating to a client without the client's consent. |
| Legal professional privilege | Allows a solicitor to withhold specific information which they would otherwise be required to disclose (e.g., in court proceedings) |

Legal professional privilege applies to information between a solicitor and client, whether written or oral, direct or indirect.

Limitations are placed to prevent it being used as a cloak.

#### Legal Advice Privilege

One type of legal professional privilege is legal advice privilege, which applies only to information passed between the client and a solicitor acting in the capacity of solicitor. Documents sent to or from an independent third party are not covered by this privilege; 'copying in' a solicitor will not mean the information can be withheld. If the communication is made for the purpose of committing a fraud or crime, it will not attract privilege ([[R v Cox and Railton (1884)]]).

#### Litigation Privilege

May be claimed in respect of documents created for the sole/ dominant purpose of litigation which has commenced/ is contemplated. This extends to communications between a solicitor and third parties.

Anything said by a solicitor whilst speaking in court as an advocate is privileged, so a solicitor cannot be sued for defamation in such circumstances.

[[Three Rivers DC v Bank of England [2004] UKHL 48]] examines the limits of legal professional privilege. Privilege continues beyond the death of a client ([[Bullivant v AG for Victoria [1901]]]).

# Conflicts of Interest

Solicitors must act in the best interests of their clients (Principle 7). If the interests of two clients (or prospective clients) conflict, it will be practically impossible to act in the beset interests of the two clients simultaneously.

## Types of Conflict

Two broad situations:

1. Conflict between two or more clients ('conflict of interest')
2. Conflict between client's interest and solicitor's interest ('own interest conflict')

A solicitor can **never** act where there is a conflict between themselves and a current client.

## Conflict Between Clients

```ad-defn
title: Conflict of interest
A situation where the solicitor's or firm's separate duties to act in the best interests of two or more clients conflict (SRA glossary).
```

```ad-statute
title: Para 6.2, Code of Conduct

A solicitor or firm must not act in relation to a matter or particular aspect of it if there is a conflict of interest or a significant risk of such a conflict unless:
a) The clients have a substantially common interest in relation to the matter or aspect of it; or
b) The clients are competing for the same objective.
```

### Former Clients

Where a client's retainer has been terminated, the firm no longer owes a duty to act in that client's best interests, so a conflict cannot arise in such a situation. Even in the absence of a conflict, a firm may be prevented from acting if it holds confidential information for the former client which would be material to the work done for the new client.

### Matter or Aspect of it

Where the only conflict between the parties is their wider business interests, this will not create any conflict of interest issues.

### Significant Risk of a Conflict of Interest

An actual conflict is not required, just a significant risk. This can arise where there is an inequality of bargaining power between clients.

## Exceptions

The exceptions were introduced by the Law Society following a period of lobbying by part of the profession to liberalise the conflict of interest rules.

### Substantially Common Interest Exception (para 6.2(a))

Where there is a conflict or a significant risk of one, a solicitor or firm can still act where the clients have a substantially common interest in relation to the matter.

```ad-defn
title: Substantially common interest
A situation where there is a clear common purpose between the clients and a strong consensus as to how it is to be achieved. 
```

e.g., this exception may be used where a solicitor is instructed by a group of people who want to set up a company.

### Competing for the Same Interest ('commercial') Exception

```ad-defn
title: Competing for the same interest
Two or more clients competing for an objective which, if attained by one client, will make the objective unattainable to the other client/ clients. 
```

Here, an objective is an asset, contract or business opportunity which clients are seeking to acquire or recover through liquidation or by means of an auction or tender process, but not a public takeover.

Generally, this exception applies to corporate clients. It enables one firm to act for two companies bidding to take over a third.

### Conditions for Acting Under Exceptions

Under para 6.2:

1. All the clients must have given informed consent evidenced in writing
2. Where appropriate, effective safeguards put in place
3. The solicitor or firm is satisfied it is reasonable for them to act for all the clients.

Informed consent means the client must appreciate the issues and risks involved. Effective safeguards will be needed to protect confidential information. It must be reasonable for the solicitor to act, considering whether any clients are prejudiced, particularly if a client is vulnerable.

## Conflict of Interest Between Existing Clients

There may be two clients who originally posed no conflict, but a conflict arises during the retainer. The solicitor may continue to act for one of the clients, but must ensure that their duty of confidentiality is not put at risk.

### Own Interest Conflict

If there is an own-interest conflict, the solicitor may not act (para 6.1). This can arise in cases such as:

- A client wanting to gift a significant amount to a solicitor
- Solicitor lending money to client
- Personal relationship with the client, impacting the solicitor's ability to advise them independently and impartially.

A solicitor may not make a secret profit while acting for the client.

### Systems for Identifying Conflict

```ad-statute
title: Code of Conduct for Firms para 2.1(a)
Firms must have effective systems and controls in place to ensure they comply with all the SRA's regulatory requirements. 
```

To identify 'own interest' conflicts, the firm should assess all relevant circumstances, including whether the solicitor's ability as an individual, or that of anyone within the firm, to act in the best interests of the client is impaired by:

- Financial interests
- Personal relationships
- Appointment to public office
- Commercial relationships
- Employment.

A conflict of interest check should be done before taking on any new work.

### Professional Embarrassment

Even if no conflict, may still decline to act due to professional embarrassment. A solicitor should consider whether accepting instructions to act for a client would breach one of the Principles.

A solicitor can also take into account their own commercial considerations.

### Limited Retainer

A solicitor could be retained to act only in relation to those areas where no conflict exists, with each client seeking independent advice on the conflicting areas.

### Conveyancing

Subject to additional requirements.

# Undertakings

```ad-defn
title: Undertaking
A statement given orally or in writingk, whether or not it includes the word "undertake" or "undertaking" to someone who reasonably places reliance on it, that you or a third party will do something or cause something to be done, or refrain from doing something. (SRA Glossary)
```

A solicitor must perform all undertakings given by them within an agreed timescale, or if no timescale is agreed, within a reasonable amount of time (para 1.3 Codes of Conduct).

Even a promise to give an undertaking will usually be interpreted as an undertaking and will be binding on the solicitor concerned. Once an undertaking has been relied upon, it can be withdrawn only be agreement. A solicitor is not obliged to give or accept an undertaking.

## Why Necessary

Often given by solicitors to smooth the path of a transaction, and avoid otherwise problematic areas. e.g., avoids the need for advance deposits in some cases, since other solicitors will rely on the undertaking as just as good.

## Breach of an Undertaking

The terms of an undertaking are personally binding on the individual solicitor concerned. So if they fail to comply, they can be sued personally by the recipient. They will also breach the Code of Conduct and will be disciplined by the SRA. The firm may also be disciplined for a lack of supervision.

As there is an obligation on firms to maintain records to demonstrate compliance, and on solicitors to be able to justify their actions, firms and solicitors must maintain a system for recording undertakings that have been given and discharged.

## Oral and Written Undertakings

An undertaking is binding even if oral, though it is advisable to give them in writing. If given orally, it should be confirmed as soon as possible.

## Terms of the Undertaking

A undertaking is not a contract (no consideration). But arguably just as important.

### Wording

A previous Code of Conduct stated that any ambiguity in the wording of an undertaking would be interpreted in favour of its recipient. So take care drafting undertakings.

### Acts Outside the Solicitor's Control

Provided an undertaking which is wholly reliant on the action/ inaction of a third party should be avoided given the binding nature of such an undertaking. Could alternatively provide an undertaking to use their reasonable endeavours to ensure something happens. But again, don't give this where there is likely to be dispute over what constitutes reasonable endeavours.

### Undertaking 'on Behalf' of a Client

An undertaking may be drafted as being made 'on behalf of' the client. This will not prevent the undertaking being enforceable against the solicitor personally. It is possible to exclude personal liability, but in order to do so the solicitor must clearly and expressly disclaim personal liability.

### Timescale

Either agree a timescale or a 'reasonable' timescale will be imposed.

### Costs

Where an undertaking is given in respect of the payment of costs of another party, the term 'costs' will be implied to mean proper costs unless as specific amount is agreed.

## Client's Authority

A solicitor should ensure they have clear and express authority from their client before giving any undertakings. When such authority has been received, it may be withdrawn by the client any time until the solicitor has acted (even if expressed to be irrevocable).

### Change of Circumstances

An undertaking will remain binding if the circumstances change so that it is impossible to fulfil it, either wholly or partially. The recipient may agree to its variation or discharge. Good practice to always inform the recipient of any changes to circumstances.

### Enforcement

#### The Courts

The court is able to enforce an undertaking against a solicitor as an officer of the court. Firms are obliged to carry indemnity insurance to cover such claims. But the value of such claims may fall within the excess of these policies, leading to personal liability for the solicitor concerned.

A breach of an undertaking is likely to be a breach of professional conduct. SRA will generally not investigate a breach of an undertaking given to the court itself, unless the court reported the matter to the SRA.

An undertaking given by an incorporated law firm (limited company or LLP) is not capable of being enforced against the firm under the court's supervisory jurisdiction over solicitors as officers of the court, since such a firm has a separate legal existence. So the recipient would have to make a claim under contract, negligence or breach of trust. The firm can still face action for professional misconduct.

#### SRA and Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal

The Legal Ombudsman, SRA, and Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal have no power to enforce the performance of an undertaking, but may investigate the solicitor's conduct and impose disciplinary sanctions.

#### Liability of Others

In a firm, if an undertaking is given by an assistant solicitor and not honoured, there will be a breach of professional conduct by the solicitor and also the partners of the firm. So many firms have strict procedures about undertakings.

```ad-warning
Be super careful. If you make an undertaking to pay £100k from the proceeds of sale of a house, and the house sells for 90k, you are personally liable for the 10k. So draft the undertaking to expressly limit liability to the money received through the sale. 
```

```ad-question
Why not just have the client undertake to do something directly? And sign an undertaking/ contract to that effect?
```

# Money Laundering

```ad-defn
title: Money laundering
The process by which criminals seek to alter or launder their proceeds of crime so that it appears that these funds come from a legitimate source. 
```

Solicitors are targets for criminals in their efforts to launder the proceeds of crime.

## Money Laundering Regulations 2017

The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/692) came into force 26/06/17 and repealed and replaced the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. Since been amended by the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019 and the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020.

The Regulations apply to persons acting in the course of businesses carried out in the UK, including independent legal professions (reg 8). The vast majority of solicitors' firms will be subject to the Regulations. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.

There is a requirement for the 'beneficial owners, officers or managers' of the firm and sole practitioners to apply to the SRA for approval under the Regulations, which will be granted unless they have been convicted of a relevant offence. These offences include any which involve deception/ dishonesty.

A firm is required to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing to which the business is subject.

Services provided by law firms most likely to be targeted by money launders:

- Trust and company formation
- Conveyancing and client account services

So firms need to ensure they have appropriate measures in place to address these risks.

### Nominated Officers and Reporting Procedures

- A firm is required to establish and maintain written policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the money laundering and terrorist financing risks identified. This is mainly about systems and risk assessment.
- A firm must have a 'nominated officer' (MLRO) to receive reports within the firm of any instances of suspected money laundering and to liaise with the National Crime Agency (reg 21(3)).
- Firm must appoint an individual from senior management to be responsible for compliance with the Regulations (reg 21(1)(a)).
- Relevant employees (those in compliance/ identification of money laundering) must be screened prior to and during the course of their employment to assess their skills, knowledge, conduct and integrity. (reg 21(1)(b)).
- Establishing an independent audit function to examine and monitor firm's policies adopted to comply with the Regulations (reg 21(1)(c)).
- Controls which enable the firm to 'respond fully and rapidly' to enquiries from law enforcement as to whether it maintains a business relationship with any person, and the nature of their relationship (reg 21(8)).

## Client Due Diligence

Firms carrying out relevant business are obliged to obtain verification of the identity of each of their clients ('customer due diligence'). This includes the following circumstances (reg 27):

1. If the client and solicitor agree to form a business relationship
2. Carrying out the occasional transaction that amounts to a 'transfer of funds' exceeding EUR 1000
3. Carrying out an occasional transaction amounting to EUR 15,000 or more, whether in one transaction or several linked transactions
4. Where the solicitor suspects money laundering or terrorist financing
5. Where the solicitor doubts the veracity or adequacy of documents or information supplied to verify client identity.

Verification must take place before a business relationship is established/ before a transaction is carried out (reg 30). Proof of registration must be collected before establishing a business relationship with a company. There are certain exceptions, e.g., if there is little risk of money laundering.

### Simplified Due Diligence

Simplified due diligence is permitted where a firm determines that the business relationship or transaction presents a low risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. If the transaction and client are eligible for simplified due diligence, the solicitor will not necessarily need to obtain information on the beneficial owners.

### Standard Due Diligence

Will apply to most clients. The solicitor is obliged to verify the identity of the client on the basis of documents/ information from a reliable source which is independent of the person whose identity is being verified.

- For companies/ trusts, take reasonable measures to understand ownership and control structures.
- For natural persons, need passports/ driving licences.
- For partnerships, obtain information on the constituent individuals (other than where partnerships are well-known reputable organisations with long histories)
- For companies, need to know:
	- Name
	- Company number
	- Registered office address and principal place of business
	- Proof of registration
	- Reasonable efforts to obtain constitution, names of board of directors
		- This will be helped by the obligation on a UK body corporate to provide certain information on request when it forms a business relationship with a firm.

The definition of a beneficial owner varies depending on the nature of the client.

```ad-defn
title: Beneficial owner of a company
For companies, reg 5(1) defines a beneficial owner as:
- Any individual who exercises ultimate control over the management of the body corporate
- Any individual who ultimately owns or controls more than 25% of the shares/ voting rights in the body corporate. 
- An individual who controls the body corporate
```

This does **not** apply to a company listed on a regulated market, but does apply to LLPs.

```ad-defn
title: Beneficial owner of a partnership
Reg 5(3) defines the beneficial owner of a partnership as any individual who:
- Is ultimately entitled to or controls $>25\%$ of capital/ profits/ voting rights of the partnership
- Otherwise exercises control over the management of the partnership.
```

```ad-defn
title: Beneficial owner of a trust
Reg 6(1) says this includes:
- The settlor
- The trustees
- The beneficiary
- The class of persons in whose main interest the trust is set up
- Any individual who has control over the trust. 
```

This is more thorough than for companies, since the trust does not have legal personality itself. Beneficial owners are those individuals who hold equivalent or similar positions to those set out in reg 6(1).

### Enhanced Due Diligence

Enhanced due diligence must be carried out where (reg 33):

- High risk of money laundering/ terrorist financing, identified by the firm/ information provided by the SRA and Law Society
- Client/ other party to transaction is established in a high-risk third party
- Client has provided false or stolen identification documentation
- Client is a politically exposed person (PEP), or a family member or close associate of a PEP
- Transaction is complex or unusually large
- Any other situation where there is a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing.

A solicitor must take measures to examine the background and purpose of a transaction and consider whether it is appropriate to obtain further independent verification of the client or beneficial owner's identity or more detail on the ownership and control structure of the client.

A PEP is an individual who is entrusted with prominent public functions. They have been a focus for the Financial Action Task Force and other bodies because of concerns about using their political positions to corruptly enrich themselves.

Where a solicitor is dealing with a PEP, additional obligations are placed on the solicitor, such as having the approval of senior management to act for the client, taking adequate measures to establish the source of wealth and enhanced ongoing monitoring.

A solicitor is obliged to undertake ongoing monitoring of business relationships to ensure transactions are consistent with the solicitor's knowledge of the client (reg 28(11)).

## Training

Firms are obliged to train employees and agents used about money laundering (reg 24). Employees should be made aware of the law relating to money laundering, terrorist financing and data protection.

Where no training is given, may provide the employee with a defence under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

### Record Keeping

Keep detailed records to satisfy due diligence requirements. Records must be kept for at least 5 years from when the business relationship ends.

### Proceeds of Crime Act 2002

This Act made it an offence to be involved in money laundering. There are 3 offences that most concern solicitors.

### Arrangements

```ad-statute
title: Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 328

(1) A person commits an offence if he enters into or becomes concerned in an arrangement which he knows or suspects facilitates (by whatever means) the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person.

(2) But a person does not commit such an offence if—

- (a) he makes an authorised disclosure under section 338 and (if the disclosure is made before he does the act mentioned in subsection (1)) he has the appropriate consent;

- (b) he intended to make such a disclosure but had a reasonable excuse for not doing so;

- (c) the act he does is done in carrying out a function he has relating to the enforcement of any provision of this Act or of any other enactment relating to criminal conduct or benefit from criminal conduct.

(3) Nor does a person commit an offence under subsection (1) if—

- (a) he knows, or believes on reasonable grounds, that the relevant criminal conduct occurred in a particular country or territory outside the United Kingdom, and

- (b) the relevant criminal conduct—

	- (i) was not, at the time it occurred, unlawful under the criminal law then applying in that country or territory, and
	
	- (ii) is not of a description prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State.

(4) In subsection (3) _“the relevant criminal conduct”_ is the criminal conduct by reference to which the property concerned is criminal property.

(5) A deposit-taking body, electronic money institution or payment institution]3 that does an act mentioned in subsection (1) does not commit an offence under that subsection if—

- (a) it does the act in operating an account maintained with it, and

- (b) the arrangement facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property of a value that is less than the threshold amount determined under section 339A for the act.
```

This is drafted very widely. There is no requirement that the funds pass through the hands of the solicitor for them to be criminally liable. The maximum penalty is 14 years' imprisonment.

```ad-defn
title: Criminal property
A person's direct or indirect benefit from criminal conduct (s 340)
```

Criminal conduct is defined very widely to include basically all offences, including conduct internationally which is criminalised in the UK.

A solicitor does not commit an offence under s 328 if they make an authorised disclosure to the firm's nominated officer as soon as is practically possible. If the nominated officer decides to make a report to the NCA, they are unable to consent to the transaction proceeding until:

- The NCA consents
- The NCA does not respond after 7 working days (starting the day after disclosure)
- Where consent is refused, and 31 days have since passed.

A solicitor may seek to make an authorised disclosure whilst the prohibited act is ongoing. To avoid breaching s 328, they must satisfy s 338(2A):

- Disclosure made whilst the prohibited act is ongoing
- When the alleged offender began to do the act, they did not know/ suspect criminal assets
- Disclosure made as soon as is practicable.

A solicitor may also seek to make an authorised disclosure after the prohibited act is completed, but must have a good reason for their failure to disclose prior to their completing the act (s 338(3)).

#### Exception: Litigation

```ad-important
In [[Bowman v Fels [2005] EWCA Civ 226]], the Court of Appeal held that taking steps in litigation and the resolution of issues in a litigious context were excluded from the scope of s 328. 
```

But the solicitor would not be able to take advantage of this exclusion if the litigation was a sham created for the purpose of money laundering.

#### Exception: Overseas Crime

A solicitor will not commit an offence where the criminal conduct occurred outside the UK and was not unlawful in the country where it happened. But this defence is not available where the offence would carry a sentence of $\geq 12$ months in the UK.

#### Acquisition, Use or Possession

```ad-statute
title: Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 329

(1) A person commits an offence if he—

- (a) acquires criminal property;

- (b) uses criminal property;

- (c) has possession of criminal property.

(2) But a person does not commit such an offence if—

- (a) he makes an authorised disclosure under section 338 and (if the disclosure is made before he does the act mentioned in subsection (1)) he has the appropriate consent;

- (b) he intended to make such a disclosure but had a reasonable excuse for not doing so;

- (c) he acquired or used or had possession of the property for adequate consideration;

- (d) the act he does is done in carrying out a function he has relating to the enforcement of any provision of this Act or of any other enactment relating to criminal conduct or benefit from criminal conduct.

(2A) Nor does a person commit an offence under subsection (1) if—

- (a) he knows, or believes on reasonable grounds, that the relevant criminal conduct occurred in a particular country or territory outside the United Kingdom, and

- (b) the relevant criminal conduct—

	- (i) was not, at the time it occurred, unlawful under the criminal law then applying in that country or territory, and
	
	- (ii) is not of a description prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State.

(2B) In subsection (2A) _“the relevant criminal conduct”_ is the criminal conduct by reference to which the property concerned is criminal property.

(2C) A deposit-taking body [, electronic money institution or payment institution]3 that does an act mentioned in subsection (1) does not commit an offence under that subsection if—

- (a) it does the act in operating an account maintained with it, and

- (b) the value of the criminal property concerned is less than the threshold amount determined under section 339A for the act.

(3) For the purposes of this section—

- (a) a person acquires property for inadequate consideration if the value of the consideration is significantly less than the value of the property;

- (b) a person uses or has possession of property for inadequate consideration if the value of the consideration is significantly less than the value of the use or possession;

- (c) the provision by a person of goods or services which he knows or suspects may help another to carry out criminal conduct is not consideration.
```

##### Adequate Consideration Defence

An issue may arise where a solicitor received money for their costs for work carried out for a client charged with a criminal offence, and there is the possibility that the money in question is criminal property.

The defence applies where professional advisers receive money for costs, but the fees charged must be reasonable. Returning the balance of money in an account to a client may be an offence under s 328 if the solicitor knows/ suspects the money is criminal property. In this case, an authorised disclosure must be made.

#### Failure to Disclose

A person commits an offence under s 330 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 if:

1. They know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds to know or suspect, that a person is engaged in money laundering; and
2. The information comes to them in the course of a business in the regulated sector; and
3. The information may assist in identifying the money launderer or the location of any laundered property; and
4. They do not make an authorised disclosure as soon as is practicable.

```ad-statute
title: Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, s 330

(1) A person commits an offence if [the conditions in subsections (2) to (4) are satisfied.

(2) The first condition is that he—

- (a) knows or suspects, or

- (b) has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting,

that another person is engaged in money laundering.

(3) The second condition is that the information or other matter—

- (a) on which his knowledge or suspicion is based, or

- (b) which gives reasonable grounds for such knowledge or suspicion,

came to him in the course of a business in the regulated sector.

(3A) The third condition is—

- (a) that he can identify the other person mentioned in subsection (2) or the whereabouts of any of the laundered property, or

- (b) that he believes, or it is reasonable to expect him to believe, that the information or other matter mentioned in subsection (3) will or may assist in identifying that other person or the whereabouts of any of the laundered property.

(4) The fourth condition is that he does not make the required disclosure to—

- (a) a nominated officer, or

- (b) a person authorised for the purposes of this Part by [the Director General of the National Crime Agency,

as soon as is practicable after the information or other matter mentioned in subsection (3) comes to him.
```

Breaking this down:

| Term | Explanation |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective test | A solicitor will commit this offence even where they genuinely did not know or suspect a person was engaged in money laundering. So turning a blind eye is no defence. |
| Regulated sector | Most solicitors' firms fall within this category. |
| The information | The information obtained must be of some use to the authorities. So the solicitor must identify/ believe the information will assist authorities. Again, an objective test. |
| Authorised disclosure | A solicitor will be provided with a defence to s 330 if they make an authorised disclosure to the firm's nominated officer as soon as practically possible. |
| Reasonable excuse for non-disclosure | Reasonable excuse is a defence |
| Training | If not trained, employee has a defence against s 330 offence |

##### Confidentiality and Privilege

A solicitor is under a duty at common law to keep confidential certain information given to them by a client. This is referred to as legal professional privilege (LPP). Communications will be protected from disclosure if they fall within 'advice privilege' or 'litigation privilege'. But LLP cannot be relied upon where communication takes place for committing an offence.

A solicitor is not obliged under s 330 to disclose any information that comes to them as a professional legal adviser in privileged circumstances, or in relation to legal proceedings, whether contemplated or actual. Does not apply where the information is communicated for the intention of furthering a criminal purpose.

##### Overseas Defence

If the solicitor believes the money laundering is taking place outside the UK, and it is not unlawful in that country, they do not have to disclose anything.

##### Penalty

Maximum 5 years' imprisonment for s 330 offence.

#### Tipping Off

```ad-statute
title: Disclosing a suspicious activity report (s 333A(1))
It is an offence to disclose to any person that a suspicious activity report (on money laundering) has been made if that disclosure is likely to prejudice any investigation that follows such a report. 
```

```ad-statute
title: Disclosing an investigation (s 333A(3))
More general offence which is committed where a disclosure is made to any person that an investigation into money laundering is being carried out or contemplated, and that disclosure is likely to prejudice the money laundering investigation.
```

##### Defences

There are a number of defences to tipping off:

1. the person who made the disclosure did not know or suspect that the disclosure would prejudice an investigation into money laundering (s 333D(3) and (4)).
2. Disclosure is made to the client for the purposes of dissuading the client from engaging in the alleged money laundering (s 333D(2))

##### Penalties

Carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/ or max. 2 year prison sentence.

##### Regulated Sector

Above offences only apply to the regulated sector, though similar provisions are in effect for work outside the regulated sector under s 342.

#### Confidentiality

A solicitor is under a duty under para 6.3 Codes of Conduct to keep confidential the affairs of clients (and former clients) unless disclosure is required or permitted by law, or the client consents.

When making s 328 or s 330 disclosures, the legislation expressly provides that such a disclosure will not breach this duty and is permitted by law.

#### Criminal Finances Act 2017

From 30/09/17, Criminal Finances Act 2017 introduced the corporate offence of failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion. It applies to law firms as 'relevant bodies'.

This makes a firm liable for failing to prevent tax evasion by its employees/ other associated persons. There is strict liability for the offence: no knowledge or intention is required on the part of the firm/ senior management.

The only defence available is that the firm had reasonable prevention procedures in place (or it was reasonable not to have such measures). The penalty is unlimited fines and confiscation of assets. A firm-wide assessment of risk and internal procedures will be required.

Serious and extensive restrictions are imposed on those dealing with people or entities on the sanctions list. This covers all firms and imposes a requirement to inform the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) if it is known or reasonably suspected that a person is a designated person has committed offences under financial sanctions/ asset freezing regimes. If the firm still wants to act for the person, needs a licence from OFSI.

```ad-note
title: Summary
1. Money laundering is the process whereby the proceeds of crime are changed so that they appear to come from a legitimate source.  
2. The Government has introduced legislation to disrupt this process.  
3. Solicitors who undertake relevant business must comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/692).  
4. Under the 2017 Regulations, firms must appoint a nominated officer, who will receive internal reports concerning money laundering and must consider whether to report the matter to the NCA.  
5. A person commits an offence under s 328 of the Proceeds of Crim e Act 2002 where they become concerned in an arrangement involving money laundering.  
6. Section 328 does not apply to steps taken in litigation.  
7. A person commits an offence under s 329 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 if they acquire, use or have possession of criminal property  
8. A solicitor within the regulated sector is obliged to disclose any suspected money laundering activity to their nominated officer under s 330 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  
9. It is an offence to disclose to any person that a disclosure has been made where this may prejudice an investigation.
```

# Financial Services

Solicitors often have to do financial services work and will have to comply with FCA and SRA regulations.

Work could arise:

- In conveyancing (e.g., helping a client finding a mortgage and support package)
- In probate (when executors sell off assets)
- In litigation (helping a successful client to invest damages)
- etc.

A solicitor would be in breach of their duty to act in the client's best interests (Principle 7) if they did not have sufficient expertise in the area concerned. For many activities, also require authorisation.

## Source Material

- Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA 2000) came into force 30/11/2001.
- Financial Services Act 2012 extensively amends FSMA 2000.
	- Currently partly in force
	- Need to study it alongside the Orders of Council made by the Treasury - lots of the details only implemented through secondary legislation.

## Financial Services Regulatory Structure

FSMA 2000 established the FSA, to regulate financial services. Following the 2008 crisis, the Government abolished the FSA and established three bodies:

- Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
- Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)
- Financial Policy Committee (FPC).

The FCA and PRA have taken over the majority of the FSA's functions, whilst the FPC is responsible for monitoring the stability of the whole UK financial system.

### FCA

- Responsibility for the conduct of business regulation of all firms
- Responsibility for prudential regulation of firms (their safety and soundness) not regulated by the PRA.

FCA objectives are:

1. Securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers
2. Protecting and enhancing the integrity of the UK financial system
3. Promoting effective competition in the interests of consumers in the market.

The FCA can require firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions with immediate effect and can block/ stop a service or product. Also regulates consumer credit and second charge mortgages.

### PRA

Subsidiary of the Bank of England responsible for the authorisation, prudential regulation and general supervision of firms which manage significant financial risks. Such firms are known as PRA-authorised or dual-regulated firms.

### General Framework

Businesses carrying out regulated activities need to be authorised by the appropriate regulator. If certain conditions are satisfied, a firm carrying out regulated activity incidentally in the course of carrying out professional work does not have to obtain authority from the FCA provided it is regulated and supervised by a particular Designated Professional Body ('DPB'). The SRA is a DPB.

## General Restrictions

Restrictions:

- s 19 FSMA: No person may carry on a regulated activity in the UK unless authorised or exempt.
	- Can result in agreements being rendered unenforceable.
- s 21 FSMA: making an unauthorised financial promotion is prohibited.
- Any breaches of the above are criminal offences

## Regulated Activity

![[Regulated activity flowchart.png]]

### Four Tests

s 22 FSMA 2000 sets out the definition of a regulated activity, which has been substantially amended by FSA 2012.

```ad-test
title: Is an activity regulated?
Tests:
1. Are you in business?
2. Is there a specified activity?
3. Is there a specified investment, or does the specified actifvitiy relate to information about a person's financial standing or administering a benchmark?
```

```ad-note
RAO 2001 is shorthand for Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001, SI 2001/544
```

- Particular activities and investments are specified by the Treasure in RAO 2001, s 22.
- Information about a person's financial standing includes credit references and stuff
- 'Benchmark' is defined in s 22(6A) FSMA 2000.

## Specified Investments

These include:

- Company stocks and shares
- Debentures, loan stock and bonds
- Government securities
- Unit trusts and open-ended investment companies (OEICs) - like a unit trust but company rather than trust
- Insurance contracts
- Certain mortgage contracts called regulated mortgage contracts (those over land of which $\geq 40\%$ will be a dwelling)
- Home reversion/ home purchase plans
- Deposits. Note sums received by solicitors acting in the course of business are exempt.

### Specified Investment Activities

Include:

- Dealing as agent
	- Buying, selling, subscribing for or underwriting investments.
- Arranging
	- Solicitors have many clients whose transactions involve investments.
	- Solicitor may be involved as the contact between client and broker/ life company.
	- Merely introducing a client to an FCA-authorised third-party does not constitute arranging, except where the transaction relates to an insurance contract.
- Managing
	- Requires active participation beyond merely holding investments.
- Safeguarding
	- Safeguarding and administering investments belonging to a client.
- Advising
	- Giving advice to a person in their capacity as an investor on the merits of their buying/ selling/ subscribing for/ underwriting an investment.
	- Does not include generic investment
	- You could refer your client to a person authorised by the FCA to provide advice.
- Lending money on regulated mortgage

### Exclusions

Exclusions relevant to solicitors include:

- Introducing
- Using an ATP (authorised third party)
	- If the transaction is entered into with or through an ATP, on the advice given to the client by the ATP, the effect of RAO 2001 is excluded.
	- The exclusion does not apply to insurance contracts
	- Does not apply if you receive a commission
- Acting for an execution-only client
	- The client, in their capacity as an investor, is not seeking or has not sought advice from the solicitor as to the merits of the client's entering into the transaction.
- Acting as a trustee or personal representative
	- Applies to arranging, managing, safeguarding or advising fellow trustees and/or beneficiaries.
	- Has limitations: available to a solicitor acting as trustee or PR, but not a solicitor acting **for** a trustee/ PR.
	- Does not apply to insurance contracts.
- The 'professional/ necessary' exclusion
	- Applies to advising, arranging, safeguarding and dealing as agents.
	- Exclusion if the activity is performed in the course of carrying on any profession or business, may be reasonably regarded as a necessary part of other services provided in the course of that profession or business.
	- Necessary means they can't get from A to B without solicitor doing this. Strictly necessary.
- The 'takeover' exclusion
	- Exclusion applies to arranging, advising and dealing as agent. Applies to a transaction to acquire or dispose of shares in a body corporate or for a transaction entered into for the purposes of such an acquisition or disposal, if:
		- Shares consist of 50% or more of voting rights in the body corporate, and
		- The acquisition or disposal is between parties each of whom is a body corporate, a partnership, a single individual or a group of connected individuals.
	- Extremely valuable exclusion for the corporate department where a client is seeking to take over or sell its interest in a company, whether public or private.

#### Summary

| Specified activity | Applicable exclusions |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dealing as agent | ATP, execution-only, professional/necessary, takeover |
| Arranging | Introducing, ATP, execution-only, professional/necessary, acting as trustee/PR, takeover |
| Advising | Professional/necessary, acting as trustee/PR, takeover |
| Managing | Acting as trustee/PR |
| Safeguarding | Professional/necessary, acting as trustee/PR |

#### S 327 Exemption for Professional Firms

Under s 326 FSMA 2000, the Treasury can designate a professional body (DPB). It has designated the Law Society - with this role now undertaken by the SRA.

Under s 327, the general prohibition in s 19 FSMA will not apply to regulated activity carried on by a firm of solicitors if the following are met:

1. The firm must not receive from a person other than the client any pecuniary or other advantage out of the activity for which it does not account to its client;
	- Mirrored by para 4.1 Code for Solicitors and para 5.1 Code for Firms
2. The manner of providing 'any service in the course of carrying on the activities must be incidental to the provision' by the firm of professional services, i.e., services regulated by the SRA.
	- There are two tests for 'incidental'; a specific and a general one.
	- Specific test
		- Refers to the particular client concerned: the relevant regulated activity must arise out of, or be complementary to, the provision of a particular professional service to a particular client.
		- Both the professional and regulated service must be supplied to the same person.
	- General test
		- Activities carries out by the firm which would otherwise be regulated cannot be a major part of the firm's activities. Consider
			- Scale of regulated activities as a proportion
			- Whether regulated activities are held out as a separate service
			- The impression given of how the firm provides those activities
3. The firm must carry out only regulated activities permitted by the DPB (i.e., the SRA).
	- SRA has published the SRA Financial Services (Scope) Rules and the SRA Conduct of Business (COB) Rules for this purpose
		- These set out in great deal what is and is not prohibited.
4. The activities must not be prohibited by an order made by the Treasury, or any direction by the FCA under s 328 or 329.
	- Such prohibited activities are listed in FSMA 2000 (Professions) (Non-Exempt Activities) Order 2001
	- FCA also has authority to prohibit stuff.
5. The firm must not carry on any other regulated activities.
	- i.e., exemption cannot be used by FCA-authorised firms.

## SRA Financial Services (Conduct of Business) Rules

```ad-warning
COB Rules apply only when the firm is carrying out an exempt regulated activity. 
```

### Status Disclosure

r 2.1 and 2.2: A firm must provide clients with certain information concerning the status of the firm (e.g., this firm is not authorised by the FCA, complaint and redress mechanisms provided through SRA and Legal Ombudsman).

### Best Execution

r 3.1: A solicitor must act in the best interests of their clients (Principle 7). The firm must carry out transactions for clients as soon as possible unless it reasonably believes it is in the client's best interest not to.

### Transactions

r 4.1 and 4.2: The firm must keep records of:

- Instructions from clients to carry out transactions
- Instructions to third parties to carry them out.

## Commissions

r 5.1: The firm must keep records of commissions received in respect of regulated activities and how these were dealt with.

### Execution-only Clients

r 7.1: Where a firm acts for an execution-only client and the investment concerned is a retail investment product, it must send a letter to the client confirming that the client is not relying on the advice of the solicitor.

### Insurance Distribution Activities

COB Rules, Part 3: Rules which must be complied with whenever any insurance distribution activities are carried out. Detailed.

## Consumer Credit Activity

From 01/04/14, consumer credit activity became a regulated activity for the purposes of s 22 SMA 2000. These activities are set out in Pt 2 and Pt 3A RAO 2001.

Solicitors carrying out such activities need FCA authorisation, or need to ensure the activities fall within the s 327 exemption. Representing a client in a litigation matter surrounding a consumer credit agreement is not a credit-related matter for these purposes.

Allowing a client time to pay/ to pay in instalments will be regarded as exempt so long as:

- Number of repayments does not exceed 12
- Payment term does not exceed 12 months
- Credit is provided without interest or other charge.

### Insurance Distribution

Regulation extended to all general insurance selling and administration in order to comply with the Insurance Mediation Directive (2002/92/EC) and the Insurance Distribution Directive (2016/97/EC) - EU legislation.

Rights under contracts of insurance are specified investments. There are other specified activities set out in RAO 2001 which specifically cover insurance contracts.

If a solicitor assists a client in obtaining a contract of insurance, even if they just introduce the client to an insurance broker, the solicitor will be carrying out a specified activity.

If a solicitor is involved in an insurance claim against an insurance company, this will also be caught. All these activities involve insurance distribution.

So for insurance distribution, firm will have to:

- Rely on s,327 exemption, or
- Seek authorisation from the FCA
- Or rely on limited exemptions for insurance distribution activities (outside scope).

## Financial Promotions

```ad-statute
title: FSMA 2000, s 21
A solicitor who is not authorised by the FCA will be unable to make a financial promotion (i.e., communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity) unless its contents are approved by an authorised person. 
```

Use the same 4-stage test as for regulated activities. But note that the exclusion test is not applicable. So although you may be carrying out an activity which is not regulated, it may be controlled and subject to restrictions on financial promotions.

Almost anything you say or write in connection with many transactions could be construed as financial promotion.

```ad-example
A solicitor advising PRs to sell the deceased's assets could be an invitation to deal in investments if the estate includes shares or gilts.
```

Both real-time and non-real-time communications are caught.

```ad-defn
title: Solicited communication
A real-time communication is solicited where it is made in the course of a personal visit, phone call or other interactive dialogue, and that
- was initiated by the recipient, or
- takes place as a result of an express request from the recipient of the communication. 
```

### Exemptions

Some exemptions are set out in FPO 2005. These include:

- Trustees, PRs
- Takeover of body corporate.

### Exemptions for Exempt Professional Firms

Two exemptions for firms claiming the special exemption under FSMA 2000 for exempt regulated activities.

#### Real-time Promotions (FPO 2005, Art 55)

A solicitor who carries out exempt regulated activities may make a real-time promotion:

- If made to a client who has engaged the solicitor to provide professional services; and
- Where the controlled activity to which the communication relates is exempt because of the exemption for professional firms, or is exempted by the 'necessary' exemption; and
- Where the controlled activity would be undertaken for the purposes of, and incidental to, the provision of professional services at the request of the client.

#### Non-real-time Promotions (FPO 2005, Art 55A)

Promotion must contain certain specific statements.

### One-off Promotions (FPO 2005 Arts 28/28A)

One-off non-real-time communications and solicited real-time communications are exempt if certain conditions are met; essentially if they are personal to the client.

One-off, unsolicited real-time communications are exempt provided the solicitor believes on reasonable grounds, that:

1. The client understands the risks associated with engaging in the investment activity, and
2. At the time of communication, the client would expect to be contacted by the solicitor in relation to that investment activity.

### Introducers

A solicitor may make any real-time communication in order to introduce a client to an ATP, provided (art 15 FPO 2005):

- Not connected to the ATP (e.g., a close relative)
- Do not receive from anyone but the client any money/advantage from making the introduction
- The client is not seeking/ has not sought advice from you as to the merits of engaging in investment activity.
