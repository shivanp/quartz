# Financial Services

Solicitors often have to do financial services work and will have to comply with FCA and SRA regulations.

Work could arise:

- In conveyancing (e.g., helping a client finding a mortgage and support package)
- In probate (when executors sell off assets)
- In litigation (helping a successful client to invest damages)
- etc.

A solicitor would be in breach of their duty to act in the client's best interests (Principle 7) if they did not have sufficient expertise in the area concerned. For many activities, also require authorisation.

## Source Material

- Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA 2000) came into force 30/11/2001.
- Financial Services Act 2012 extensively amends FSMA 2000.
	- Currently partly in force
	- Need to study it alongside the Orders of Council made by the Treasury - lots of the details only implemented through secondary legislation.

# Financial Services Regulatory Structure

FSMA 2000 established the FSA, to regulate financial services. Following the 2008 crisis, the Government abolished the FSA and established three bodies:

- Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
- Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)
- Financial Policy Committee (FPC).

The FCA and PRA have taken over the majority of the FSA's functions, whilst the FPC is responsible for monitoring the stability of the whole UK financial system.

## FCA

- Responsibility for the conduct of business regulation of all firms
- Responsibility for prudential regulation of firms (their safety and soundness) not regulated by the PRA.

FCA objectives are:

1. Securing an appropriate degree of protection for consumers
2. Protecting and enhancing the integrity of the UK financial system
3. Promoting effective competition in the interests of consumers in the market.

The FCA can require firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions with immediate effect and can block/ stop a service or product. Also regulates consumer credit and second charge mortgages.

## PRA

Subsidiary of the Bank of England responsible for the authorisation, prudential regulation and general supervision of firms which manage significant financial risks. Such firms are known as PRA-authorised or dual-regulated firms.

## General Framework

Businesses carrying out regulated activities need to be authorised by the appropriate regulator. If certain conditions are satisfied, a firm carrying out regulated activity incidentally in the course of carrying out professional work does not have to obtain authority from the FCA provided it is regulated and supervised by a particular Designated Professional Body ('DPB'). The SRA is a DPB.

# General Restrictions

Restrictions:

- s 19 FSMA: No person may carry on a regulated activity in the UK unless authorised or exempt.
	- Can result in agreements being rendered unenforceable.
- s 21 FSMA: making an unauthorised financial promotion is prohibited.
- Any breaches of the above are criminal offences

# Regulated Activity

![[Regulated activity flowchart.png]]

## Four Tests

s 22 FSMA 2000 sets out the definition of a regulated activity, which has been substantially amended by FSA 2012.

```ad-test
title: Is an activity regulated?
Tests:
1. Are you in business?
2. Is there a specified activity?
3. Is there a specified investment, or does the specified actifvitiy relate to information about a person's financial standing or administering a benchmark?
```

```ad-note
RAO 2001 is shorthand for Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001, SI 2001/544
```

- Particular activities and investments are specified by the Treasure in RAO 2001, s 22.
- Information about a person's financial standing includes credit references and stuff
- 'Benchmark' is defined in s 22(6A) FSMA 2000.

# Specified Investments

These include:

- Company stocks and shares
- Debentures, loan stock and bonds
- Government securities
- Unit trusts and open-ended investment companies (OEICs) - like a unit trust but company rather than trust
- Insurance contracts
- Certain mortgage contracts called regulated mortgage contracts (those over land of which $\geq 40\%$ will be a dwelling)
- Home reversion/ home purchase plans
- Deposits. Note sums received by solicitors acting in the course of business are exempt.

## Specified Investment Activities

Include:

- Dealing as agent
	- Buying, selling, subscribing for or underwriting investments.
- Arranging
	- Solicitors have many clients whose transactions involve investments.
	- Solicitor may be involved as the contact between client and broker/ life company.
	- Merely introducing a client to an FCA-authorised third-party does not constitute arranging, except where the transaction relates to an insurance contract.
- Managing
	- Requires active participation beyond merely holding investments.
- Safeguarding
	- Safeguarding and administering investments belonging to a client.
- Advising
	- Giving advice to a person in their capacity as an investor on the merits of their buying/ selling/ subscribing for/ underwriting an investment.
	- Does not include generic investment
	- You could refer your client to a person authorised by the FCA to provide advice.
- Lending money on regulated mortgage

## Exclusions

Exclusions relevant to solicitors include:

- Introducing
- Using an ATP (authorised third party)
	- If the transaction is entered into with or through an ATP, on the advice given to the client by the ATP, the effect of RAO 2001 is excluded.
	- The exclusion does not apply to insurance contracts
	- Does not apply if you receive a commission
- Acting for an execution-only client
	- The client, in their capacity as an investor, is not seeking or has not sought advice from the solicitor as to the merits of the client's entering into the transaction.
- Acting as a trustee or personal representative
	- Applies to arranging, managing, safeguarding or advising fellow trustees and/or beneficiaries.
	- Has limitations: available to a solicitor acting as trustee or PR, but not a solicitor acting **for** a trustee/ PR.
	- Does not apply to insurance contracts.
- The 'professional/ necessary' exclusion
	- Applies to advising, arranging, safeguarding and dealing as agents.
	- Exclusion if the activity is performed in the course of carrying on any profession or business, may be reasonably regarded as a necessary part of other services provided in the course of that profession or business.
	- Necessary means they can't get from A to B without solicitor doing this. Strictly necessary.
- The 'takeover' exclusion
	- Exclusion applies to arranging, advising and dealing as agent. Applies to a transaction to acquire or dispose of shares in a body corporate or for a transaction entered into for the purposes of such an acquisition or disposal, if:
		- Shares consist of 50% or more of voting rights in the body corporate, and
		- The acquisition or disposal is between parties each of whom is a body corporate, a partnership, a single individual or a group of connected individuals.
	- Extremely valuable exclusion for the corporate department where a client is seeking to take over or sell its interest in a company, whether public or private.

### S 327 Exemption for Professional Firms

Under s 326 FSMA 2000, the Treasury can designate a professional body (DPB). It has designated the Law Society - with this role now undertaken by the SRA.

Under s 327, the general prohibition in s 19 FSMA will not apply to regulated activity carried on by a firm of solicitors if the following are met:

1. The firm must not receive from a person other than the client any pecuniary or other advantage out of the activity for which it does not account to its client;
	- Mirrored by para 4.1 Code for Solicitors and para 5.1 Code for Firms
2. The manner of providing 'any service in the course of carrying on the activities must be incidental to the provision' by the firm of professional services, i.e., services regulated by the SRA.
	- There are two tests for 'incidental'; a specific and a general one.
	- Specific test
		- Refers to the particular client concerned: the relevant regulated activity must arise out of, or be complementary to, the provision of a particular professional service to a particular client.
		- Both the professional and regulated service must be supplied to the same person.
	- General test
		- Activities carries out by the firm which would otherwise be regulated cannot be a major part of the firm's activities. Consider
			- Scale of regulated activities as a proportion
			- Whether regulated activities are held out as a separate service
			- The impression given of how the firm provides those activities
3. The firm must carry out only regulated activities permitted by the DPB (i.e., the SRA).
	- SRA has published the SRA Financial Services (Scope) Rules and the SRA Conduct of Business (COB) Rules for this purpose
		- These set out in great deal what is and is not prohibited.
4. The activities must not be prohibited by an order made by the Treasury, or any direction by the FCA under s 328 or 329.
	- Such prohibited activities are listed in FSMA 2000 (Professions) (Non-Exempt Activities) Order 2001
	- FCA also has authority to prohibit stuff.
5. The firm must not carry on any other regulated activities.
	- i.e., exemption cannot be used by FCA-authorised firms.

# SRA Financial Services (Conduct of Business) Rules

```ad-warning
COB Rules apply only when the firm is carrying out an exempt regulated activity. 
```

## Status Disclosure

r 2.1 and 2.2: A firm must provide clients with certain information concerning the status of the firm (e.g., this firm is not authorised by the FCA, complaint and redress mechanisms provided through SRA and Legal Ombudsman).

## Best Execution

r 3.1: A solicitor must act in the best interests of their clients (Principle 7). The firm must carry out transactions for clients as soon as possible unless it reasonably believes it is in the client's best interest not to.

## Transactions

r 4.1 and 4.2: The firm must keep records of:

- Instructions from clients to carry out transactions
- Instructions to third parties to carry them out.

# Commissions

r 5.1: The firm must keep records of commissions received in respect of regulated activities and how these were dealt with.

## Execution-only Clients

r 7.1: Where a firm acts for an execution-only client and the investment concerned is a retail investment product, it must send a letter to the client confirming that the client is not relying on the advice of the solicitor.

## Insurance Distribution Activities

COB Rules, Part 3: Rules which must be complied with whenever any insurance distribution activities are carried out. Detailed.

# Consumer Credit Activity

From 01/04/14, consumer credit activity became a regulated activity for the purposes of s 22 SMA 2000. These activities are set out in Pt 2 and Pt 3A RAO 2001.

Solicitors carrying out such activities need FCA authorisation, or need to ensure the activities fall within the s 327 exemption. Representing a client in a litigation matter surrounding a consumer credit agreement is not a credit-related matter for these purposes.

Allowing a client time to pay/ to pay in instalments will be regarded as exempt so long as:

- Number of repayments does not exceed 12
- Payment term does not exceed 12 months
- Credit is provided without interest or other charge.

## Insurance Distribution

Regulation extended to all general insurance selling and administration in order to comply with the Insurance Mediation Directive (2002/92/EC) and the Insurance Distribution Directive (2016/97/EC) - EU legislation.

Rights under contracts of insurance are specified investments. There are other specified activities set out in RAO 2001 which specifically cover insurance contracts.

If a solicitor assists a client in obtaining a contract of insurance, even if they just introduce the client to an insurance broker, the solicitor will be carrying out a specified activity.

If a solicitor is involved in an insurance claim against an insurance company, this will also be caught. All these activities involve insurance distribution.

So for insurance distribution, firm will have to:

- Rely on s,327 exemption, or
- Seek authorisation from the FCA
- Or rely on limited exemptions for insurance distribution activities (outside scope).

# Financial Promotions

```ad-statute
title: FSMA 2000, s 21
A solicitor who is not authorised by the FCA will be unable to make a financial promotion (i.e., communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity) unless its contents are approved by an authorised person. 
```

Use the same 4-stage test as for regulated activities. But note that the exclusion test is not applicable. So although you may be carrying out an activity which is not regulated, it may be controlled and subject to restrictions on financial promotions.

Almost anything you say or write in connection with many transactions could be construed as financial promotion.

```ad-example
A solicitor advising PRs to sell the deceased's assets could be an invitation to deal in investments if the estate includes shares or gilts.
```

Both real-time and non-real-time communications are caught.

```ad-defn
title: Solicited communication
A real-time communication is solicited where it is made in the course of a personal visit, phone call or other interactive dialogue, and that
- was initiated by the recipient, or
- takes place as a result of an express request from the recipient of the communication. 
```

## Exemptions

Some exemptions are set out in FPO 2005. These include:

- Trustees, PRs
- Takeover of body corporate.

## Exemptions for Exempt Professional Firms

Two exemptions for firms claiming the special exemption under FSMA 2000 for exempt regulated activities.

### Real-time Promotions (FPO 2005, Art 55)

A solicitor who carries out exempt regulated activities may make a real-time promotion:

- If made to a client who has engaged the solicitor to provide professional services; and
- Where the controlled activity to which the communication relates is exempt because of the exemption for professional firms, or is exempted by the 'necessary' exemption; and
- Where the controlled activity would be undertaken for the purposes of, and incidental to, the provision of professional services at the request of the client.

### Non-real-time Promotions (FPO 2005, Art 55A)

Promotion must contain certain specific statements.

## One-off Promotions (FPO 2005 Arts 28/28A)

One-off non-real-time communications and solicited real-time communications are exempt if certain conditions are met; essentially if they are personal to the client.

One-off, unsolicited real-time communications are exempt provided the solicitor believes on reasonable grounds, that:

1. The client understands the risks associated with engaging in the investment activity, and
2. At the time of communication, the client would expect to be contacted by the solicitor in relation to that investment activity.

## Introducers

A solicitor may make any real-time communication in order to introduce a client to an ATP, provided (art 15 FPO 2005):

- Not connected to the ATP (e.g., a close relative)
- Do not receive from anyone but the client any money/advantage from making the introduction
- The client is not seeking/ has not sought advice from you as to the merits of engaging in investment activity.
