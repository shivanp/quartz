# Conflicts of Interest

Solicitors must act in the best interests of their clients (Principle 7). If the interests of two clients (or prospective clients) conflict, it will be practically impossible to act in the beset interests of the two clients simultaneously.

## Types of Conflict

Two broad situations:

1. Conflict between two or more clients ('conflict of interest')
2. Conflict between client's interest and solicitor's interest ('own interest conflict')

A solicitor can **never** act where there is a conflict between themselves and a current client.

## Conflict Between Clients

```ad-defn
title: Conflict of interest
A situation where the solicitor's or firm's separate duties to act in the best interests of two or more clients conflict (SRA glossary).
```

```ad-statute
title: Para 6.2, Code of Conduct

A solicitor or firm must not act in relation to a matter or particular aspect of it if there is a conflict of interest or a significant risk of such a conflict unless:
a) The clients have a substantially common interest in relation to the matter or aspect of it; or
b) The clients are competing for the same objective.
```

### Former Clients

Where a client's retainer has been terminated, the firm no longer owes a duty to act in that client's best interests, so a conflict cannot arise in such a situation. Even in the absence of a conflict, a firm may be prevented from acting if it holds confidential information for the former client which would be material to the work done for the new client.

### Matter or Aspect of it

Where the only conflict between the parties is their wider business interests, this will not create any conflict of interest issues.

### Significant Risk of a Conflict of Interest

An actual conflict is not required, just a significant risk. This can arise where there is an inequality of bargaining power between clients.

## Exceptions

The exceptions were introduced by the Law Society following a period of lobbying by part of the profession to liberalise the conflict of interest rules.

### Substantially Common Interest Exception (para 6.2(a))

Where there is a conflict or a significant risk of one, a solicitor or firm can still act where the clients have a substantially common interest in relation to the matter.

```ad-defn
title: Substantially common interest
A situation where there is a clear common purpose between the clients and a strong consensus as to how it is to be achieved. 
```

e.g., this exception may be used where a solicitor is instructed by a group of people who want to set up a company.

### Competing for the Same Interest ('commercial') Exception

```ad-defn
title: Competing for the same interest
Two or more clients competing for an objective which, if attained by one client, will make the objective unattainable to the other client/ clients. 
```

Here, an objective is an asset, contract or business opportunity which clients are seeking to acquire or recover through liquidation or by means of an auction or tender process, but not a public takeover.

Generally, this exception applies to corporate clients. It enables one firm to act for two companies bidding to take over a third.

### Conditions for Acting Under Exceptions

Under para 6.2:

1. All the clients must have given informed consent evidenced in writing
2. Where appropriate, effective safeguards put in place
3. The solicitor or firm is satisfied it is reasonable for them to act for all the clients.

Informed consent means the client must appreciate the issues and risks involved. Effective safeguards will be needed to protect confidential information. It must be reasonable for the solicitor to act, considering whether any clients are prejudiced, particularly if a client is vulnerable.

## Conflict of Interest Between Existing Clients

There may be two clients who originally posed no conflict, but a conflict arises during the retainer. The solicitor may continue to act for one of the clients, but must ensure that their duty of confidentiality is not put at risk.

### Own Interest Conflict

If there is an own-interest conflict, the solicitor may not act (para 6.1). This can arise in cases such as:

- A client wanting to gift a significant amount to a solicitor
- Solicitor lending money to client
- Personal relationship with the client, impacting the solicitor's ability to advise them independently and impartially.

A solicitor may not make a secret profit while acting for the client.

### Systems for Identifying Conflict

```ad-statute
title: Code of Conduct for Firms para 2.1(a)
Firms must have effective systems and controls in place to ensure they comply with all the SRA's regulatory requirements. 
```

To identify 'own interest' conflicts, the firm should assess all relevant circumstances, including whether the solicitor's ability as an individual, or that of anyone within the firm, to act in the best interests of the client is impaired by:

- Financial interests
- Personal relationships
- Appointment to public office
- Commercial relationships
- Employment.

A conflict of interest check should be done before taking on any new work.

### Professional Embarrassment

Even if no conflict, may still decline to act due to professional embarrassment. A solicitor should consider whether accepting instructions to act for a client would breach one of the Principles.

A solicitor can also take into account their own commercial considerations.

### Limited Retainer

A solicitor could be retained to act only in relation to those areas where no conflict exists, with each client seeking independent advice on the conflicting areas.

### Conveyancing

Subject to additional requirements.
