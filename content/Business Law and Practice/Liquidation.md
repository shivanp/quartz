# Liquidation

## Introduction

Most common type of insolvency procedure: in 2019 87% of all insolvencies were liquidations.

Definition:

> Liquidation is the process by which a company's business is wound up, and its assets transferred to creditors and (if there is a surplus of assets over liabilities) to its members.

The company will be removed from the register of companies and be dissolved. 'Liquidation' and 'winding up' are used interchangeably.

It is not only insolvent companies which are wound up and liquidated. Solvent companies may also be wound up, and this is not uncommon. Companies can be wound up because founders get bored, internal disputes, etc.

## Purpose

Liquidation is the oldest and most basic corporate insolvency procedure.

> The liquidator's function is to realise the company's assets for cash, determine the identity of the company's creditors and the amount owed to each, and then pay a dividend to the creditors on a proportionate basis, relative to the size of their determined claims. Creditors of the same rank are said to rank 'pari passu'.

The ranking of creditors’ claims is set out in the [Insolvency Act 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/contents), the [Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2016/1024/contents/made) and by general law.

This is not a rescue mechanism; a liquidator has only limited powers to carry on the business of a company. Will usually close the business and dismiss employees fairly immediately. Assets will be sold on a piece-meal basis. Statutory moratorium during a liquidation is very limited.

So a lot of the time, companies enter liquidation after a different insolvency procedure, like administration.

## Types of Liquidation

1. Compulsory liquidation
2. Voluntary liquidation
	1. Members' voluntary liquidation
	2. Creditors' voluntary liquidation

Following liquidation, a company's life is brought to an end automatically by dissolution.

For a compulsory liquidation, this will be three months after notice by the liquidator to the Registrar of Companies that the winding up of the company has been completed.

For voluntary liquidation, this will occur three months from the filing by the liquidator of the final accounts and return. On dissolution, the company ceases to exist.

## Compulsory Liquidation

This is a court-based process.

To begin the process, an applicant presents a winding up petition to the court under which the applicant requests the court to make a winding up order against the company on a number of statutory grounds.

When the court grants a petition for compulsory liquidation, the order operates in favour of all the creditors and contributories (members and some former members) of the company.

The Official Receiver will become the liquidator and continue in office until another person is appointed ([s 136(2) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/136)). The Official Receiver will notify Companies House and all known creditors of the liquidation. The Official Receiver has the power to summon separate meetings of the company's creditors and contributories for the purpose of choosing a person to become the liquidator of the company in their place (s 136(4)).

### Applying for a Winding up Order

The following can apply to the court for the issue of a winding up petition:

1. a creditor;
2. the company (acting by the shareholders; this would happen where there are insufficient assets in the company to fund a voluntary liquidation);
3. the directors (by board resolution); again, this would happen where there are insufficient assets to fund a voluntary liquidation;
4. an administrator;
5. an administrative receiver;
6. the supervisor of a CVA; and
7. The Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (on public policy grounds).

Grounds on which a court can order a company to be wound up ([s 122(1) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/122)):

- The company is unable to pay its debts.
- It is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.
- The company has passed a special resolution that it is to be wound up by the court.
- The company is a public company and has not issued the requisite [[share capital]] and more than a year has passed since its registration as a public company.
- The company is an old public company within the meaning of the Consequential Provisions Act.
- The company does not commence its business within a year from its [[incorporation]] or suspends its business for a whole year.

### Inability to Pay Debts

The **most common ground** for a winding up petition is the company's inability to pay its debts under [s 122(1)(f) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/122). This can be evidenced in several ways ( [s 123 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/123)):

1. Failure by the company to comply with a creditor’s statutory demand
	- A statutory demand is a written demand in a prescribed form requiring the company to pay a specific debt.
	- The statutory demand can only be used if the debt exceeds £750 and is not disputed on substantial grounds.
	- The company has 21 days in which to pay the debt, failing which the creditor has the right to petition the court to wind up the company.
2. The creditor sues the company, obtains judgment and fails in an attempt to execute the judgment debt.
3. Proof to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (the “cash-flow test”)
	- The cash flow test is usually satisfied by going through the statutory demand process in 1 above, but that is not essential.
4. Proof to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities (the 'balance sheet test')
	- [[Re Cheyne Finance plc [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) ]]

The cash-flow test must include a consideration of debts falling due in the reasonably near future ([[BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd v Eurosail-UK 2007-3BL plc [2013] ]]).

### Consequences of Winding up Order

To prevent an insolvent company from transferring its assets to third parties at the expense of its creditors, under [s 127 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/127) certain dispositions of a company's property, transfers of its [[shares]] and changes to its members will be void if made after the commencement of the winding up.

So if these dispositions etc. were made during the period between the presentation of the winding up petition and a winding up order being made, they will be [[void]]. This includes:

- Disposition of the company’s property;
- Transfer of the company’s [[shares]];
- Altering the status of the company’s members.

Once a compulsory winding up order has been made:

- An automatic stay will be granted on commencing or continuing with proceedings against the company;
- all employees will be automatically dismissed, and
- the directors lose their powers, and they are automatically dismissed from office.

## Voluntary Winding up

[s 84(1) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/84) allows for the company to be wound up without a court order in 3 situations:

Situation | Description
---|---
Shareholder resolution | Where the company's purpose according to the articles has expired and resolution of the shareholders (rare)
Members' voluntary liquidation (MVL) | Where the company resolves by special resolution to wind up the company. The company must be solvent.
Creditors' voluntary liquidation (CVL) | Where the company resolves that it is advisable to wind up the company due to its inability to carry on its business. Here the company is insolvent.

### Members' Voluntary Liquidation

Can only be used for companies which are solvent. The directors are required to swear a **declaration of solvency**, stating that they have made a full enquiry into the solvency, and they have formed the opinion that the company will be able to pay its creditors in full, together with interest at the official rate, within a period not exceeding 12 months from the commencement of the winding up ([s 89(1) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/89)). The declaration must also contain a statement of the company's assets and liabilities as at the latest practicable date before making the declaration.

Any director making a declaration of solvency who does not have reasonable grounds for their opinion is liable to a fine or imprisonment ([s 89(4) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/89)). If the debts are not actually paid in full within the specified period, it will be presumed that the director did not have reasonable grounds for their opinion.

The members must then pass a [[Special resolution]] to place the company into MVL and an [[Ordinary resolution]] to appoint a liquidator. The winding up commences when the special resolution is passed ([s 84(1) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/84) and [s 86 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/86)).

### Conversion of MVL to CVL

On a MVL, if the liquidator considers that the company will be unable to pay its debts in full together with interest within the period stated in the directors' declaration, they must change the members' winding up into a creditors' winding up by going through the procedural conditions in [s 95 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/95). This involves the liquidator preparing and sending a statement of the company’s affairs to the company's creditors.

The company's creditors may nominate a person to be liquidator. In most cases, this will be the insolvency practitioner who was appointed to deal with the MVL. The creditors' voluntary liquidation takes effect from the date of nomination of the liquidator.

### Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation

This is a form of insolvent liquidation commenced by resolution of the shareholders, but under the effective control of the creditors, who can choose the liquidator.

Where a directors' declaration of solvency has not been made, the liquidation will be a CVL. The procedure is for the shareholders to pass a special resolution to place the company into a CVL.

The shareholders may also nominate a person to be liquidator, but in any event within **14 days** of the special resolution being passed the directors of the company must ask the company’s creditors to either approve the nominated liquidator or put forward their own choice of liquidator. Where the creditors’ choice of liquidator differs from that of the company’s shareholders, the creditors’ nomination will take precedence.

The directors must also draw up a statement of the company’s affairs (setting out the company’s assets and liabilities) and send it to the company’s creditors.

### Role of the Liquidator

The appointment of a liquidator terminates the management powers of the company's directors, and these powers are transferred to the liquidator, together with their fiduciary duties. So liquidators must act in good faith, avoid conflicts of interest and not make a secret profit ([[Silkstone and Haigh Moore Coal Co v Edey [1900] ]]).

The liquidator must be a qualified Insolvency Practitioner ([s 230 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/230)) or the Official Receiver (appointed by the court in the short term) and acts as an officer of the court.

The liquidator in both a CVL and a compulsory liquidation has extensive statutory powers. Principle functions are:

- To secure and realise the assets of the company, then distribute to the company's creditors ([s 143 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/143));
- To take into their custody or under their control all the property of the company ([s 144 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/144))

The liquidator's powers to manage the company are set out in Part I to III [Sch 4 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/schedule/4), and include powers to

- Sell any of the company's property;
- Execute deeds and other documents in the name of the company;
- Raise money on the security of the company’s assets;
- Make or draw a bill of exchange or promissory note in the name of the company;
- Appoint an agent to do any business that the liquidator is unable to do;
- Do all other things that may be necessary to wind up the company's affairs and to distribute its assets.
- Carry on the business of the company, but only to the extent that is necessary for the beneficial winding up of the company.
- Commence or defend court proceedings in the name of the company, for example to recover debts owed to it or dispute debts alleged to be owed by the company.
- Pay debts and compromise claims.

### Liquidator's Powers to Avoid Certain Transactions

Liquidators have a duty to preserve the company's property and to maximise the value of the company's assets available for distribution. Empowered to avoid certain antecedent transactions in order to maximise assets available for distribution to creditors:

- Disclaim onerous property ([s178 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/178));
- Apply to court to set aside a transaction at an undervalue ([s238 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/238));
- Apply to court to set aside a preference ([s 239 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/239));
- Apply to court to set aside, or vary the [[terms]] of, an extortionate credit transaction ([s 244 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/244));
- Claim that a floating charge created for no new, or inadequate, [[consideration]] is invalid ([s 245 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/245));
- Apply to court to set aside a transaction that will defraud creditors ([s 423 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/423)).

Many of these powers also apply to administrators.
