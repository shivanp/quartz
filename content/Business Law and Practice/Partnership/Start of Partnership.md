# Start of Partnership

## Introduction

The starting point is the Partnership Act 1890. The Law Commission issued a Consultation Paper in Autumn 2000 on revision of the law of partnerships, but this has been shelved.

Because it is a relationship, partnership imposes rights and obligations on the partners. The relationship is governed by contractual principles, but because it is also fiduciary in nature, equitable principles also regulate their relationship.

### Definition

- Describes a business relationship based on an agreement.
- Agreement may be oral or in writing, or implied by contract.
- Partnership not necessarily recognised as such by the parties.
- [[Khan v Miah [2000] 1 WLR 2123]]: the partnership had commenced even though the restaurant had not opened
- [[Young v Zahid [2006] EWCA Civ 613]]: partner in law firm who has only paid a fixed salary was still held to be a partner.
- [[Rowlands v Hodson [2009] EWCA Civ 1042]]: a solicitor who sold her interest in the partnership to a successor but retained a supervisory role was held to be a partner.

There must be more than mere agreement or setting up a partnership to form a partnership ([[Ilott v Williams & Others [2013] EWCA Civ 645]]). There must be a “carrying on a business in common”.

A partnership does not have a separate legal existence. May be created:

- For a specific purpose or for a pre-determined period of time; or
- So as to continue without reference to duration – a partnership 'at will'.

### Fundamental Characteristics

Rights include:

- Being involved in making decisions which affect the business
- Share the profits of the business
- Examine the accounts of the business
- Insist on openness and honesty from fellow partners
- Veto the introduction of a new partner
- Responsibility for sharing losses made by the business.

N.B. some of these can be excluded by the agreement governing the relationship.

## Setting up Partnership

Advisable to have a written agreement, which is well drafted. Default provisions from 1890 definitely not fit for purpose.

In [[Ham v Ham and Another [2013] EWCA Civ 1301]], the Court of Appeal criticised poorly drafted partnership agreements.

### Formalities

#### Business Names

Where ss 1192-1206 CA 2006 apply, there are controls over the choice of partnership name (ss 1193, 1194) and requirements as to revealing the names and business addresses of partners (s 1201).

These controls don't apply if the name of the partnership consists only of the names of partners, because then the Act will not apply.

If the Act applies, certain words or expressions forming part of the business name require written approval of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Also, silly rules, such as that prescribed information must appear on all stationery (s 1202). Most people ignore this and it's not deep. Also, there are exceptions.

Non-compliance will be punishable by fine, and partners will be unable to enforce contracts if the other party was prejudiced by non-compliance.

There are other peculiar statutory regulations about taxes etc.

#### Partnerships and Joint Ventures

Partnerships can also be used for joint ventures between companies. This is also governed by PA 1890. Advantages:

- Informal nature
- Commercial secrecy
- Tax relief

#### Other Structures

Other types of partnership may exist. For example the term ‘group partnership’ refers to a partnership between two or more partnerships. A sub-partnership is a partnership within a partnership, or put another it way it is a partnership with a share of another partnership.
