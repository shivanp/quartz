# Partner Responsibilities

## Introduction

A partner as certain responsibilities towards others and corresponding rights.

## Utmost Good Faith

```ad-important
By common law, a partnership is a relationship onto which is imposed a duty of utmost fairness and good faith from one partner to another. 
```

Perhaps the most fundamental obligation imposed on a partner is the duty to conduct oneself with complete good faith towards co-partners in all partnership dealings and transactions. This duty is fiduciary in nature and an inherent obligation of partnership. Partners must conduct themselves towards one another with the ‘highest standard of honour’, integrity and openness, even where their interests conflict.

```ad-example
In [[Helmore and Smith]] one judge said that he could not conceive of a stronger case of a fiduciary relationship than that which exists between partners. For example, in _Law and Law_ the court said that a partner negotiating to buy the share of another partner and who is in possession of facts material to that negotiation, is under a duty to disclose those facts to the selling partner and not to conceal what the seller does not know, even if to do so will affect the price the seller will demand. This obligation is now reflected to a large extent by the terms of section 28 of the Partnership Act.
```

### Applications in PA 1890

| Section | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| s 28 | Partners must divulge to one another all relevant information connected with the business and their relationship. |
| s 29 | Partners must be prepared to share with their fellow partners any profit or benefit they receive that is connected with or derived from the partnership, business or its property without the consent of other partners. |
| s 30 | Partners must be prepared to share with their fellow partners any profits they make from carrying out a competing business without the consent of other partners. |

In effect, partners, as fiduciaries, must not place themselves in a position whereby their interests conflict with those with whom they have a fiduciary relationship. This relationship is reciprocal in nature. Consequently, a partner who, in retaliation to another partner’s breach of duty, commits their own breach will substantially prejudice their position. It is also important to appreciate that the duty exists during negotiations to enter into partnership and whilst a partnership is being wound up.

### Disapplying Ss 28 and 29

Lastly, whilst section 19 of the Partnership Act permits the statutory duties under sections 28 to 30 to be disapplied by agreement, there is no clear authority that partners can disapply the equitable duty of good faith. Lindley & Banks on Partnership takes the view that it is possible but makes the point that a partner, properly advised, would not contemplate condoning in advance all potential breaches of duty by another.

In fact, it is common practice to impose a contractual duty of good faith to sit alongside the equitable duty so as to provide contractual remedies to sit alongside the equitable remedy.

```ad-example
The doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply to partners' dealings with one another. So in negotiating to sell the partnership business premises owned by them, a partner must not suppress information which will affect the valuation.
```

Key case: [[Broadhurse v Broadhurst]].

## Further Responsibilities

These include:

- The responsibility for bearing a share of any loss made by the business (s 24(1) PA 1890)
- The obligation as a firm to indemnify fellow partners against bearing more than their share of any liability or expense connected with the business (s 24(2) PA 1890).

There will be plenty of other responsibilities, derived from the [[Partnership Agreement]].
