# Liability for Firm Debts

## Introduction

Transactions affecting a partnership generally involve contracts. Contracts may be made by all the partners acting collectively or just one partner.

In cases where partners contest that they are liable:

- First identify whether the firm is liable
- If the firm is liable, identify which individuals are liable.

The relevant provisions of PA 1890 are based on the law of agency:

| Section | Description | Details |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s 5 | Power of a partner to bind the firm | Every partner is an agent of the firm and his other partners for the purpose of the business partnership. So all acts are binding unless (1) the partner has no authority, and (2) the person he is dealing with knows/believes this. |
| s 6 | Partners bound by acts on behalf of firm | An act or instrument done in firm name is binding on the firm and all partners. |
| s 7 | Partners using business credit for private purposes | When a partner pledges firm credit for a purpose not connected, the firm is not bound, though the partner incurs personal liability. |
| s 8 | Effect of notice that firm will not be bound by acts of partner | Restrictions can be placed on partners' ability to bind the firm, then acts in contravention of the agreement are not binding wrt people with notice of the agreement. |

> [!note]
> "Firm" here means "partners", since the partnership has no legal personality. 

s 5: the act has to be in the usual course of business (see [[Hirst v Etherington [1999] Lloyd's Rep PN 938]]).

## Firm Liability

s 5 deals with partner's authority; there is no equivalent provision for companies in CA 2006.

### Actual Authority

The firm will always be liable for actions which were actually authorised. Ways to authorise:

1. The partners may have acted jointly in making the contract;
2. Express actual authority: partners may have expressly instructed one of the partners to represent the firm in a particular transaction/ type of transaction (e.g., to purchase stock)
3. Implied actual authority: partners impliedly accepting that one or more of the partners have the authority to represent the firm in a particular type of transaction.
	- If all partners are actively involved in running the business without limitations agreed, it will be implied that each partner has authority to act in the ordinary course of business
	- Authority can be implied by a regular course of dealing by one partner to which the other have acquiesced.

### Apparent/ Ostensible Authority

The firm may be liable for actions which were not actually authorised, but which may have appeared to an outsider to be authorised. Legal reasoning: each partner is an agent of the firm ad of their fellow partners for the purposes of the partnership business. The firm will be liable by application of s 5 where:

1. The transaction is one relating to the type of business in which the firm is apparently engaged ('business of the kind carried on by the firm' – s 5);
2. The transaction is for which a partner in such a firm would usually be expected to have the authority to act ('in the usual way' – s 5);
3. The other party to the transaction did not know that the partner did not actually have the authority to act; and
4. The other party deals with a person whom they know or believe to be a partner.

(3) and (4) are subjective tests, whereas (a) and (b) are objective.

- In [[JJ Coughlan v Ruparelia [2003] EWCA Civ 1057]], the other partners were not liable in contract.
- In [[Bourne v Brandon Davis [2006] EWHC 1567 (Ch)]], held that musicians in a pop group could not have their performing rights assigned *en bloc* by another member of the group without their consent.

### Personal Liability

- In all the above instances, the partner will be personally liable to the other party.
- Where a partner has acted without actual authority but has made the firm liable by virtue of their apparent authority, they are liable to indemnify the partner's fellow partners for any liability or loss they incur.

### Tortious Liability

So far liability in contract was considered. What about liability in tort?

s 10 makes the firm liable for any wrongful act or omission of a partner who acts in the ordinary course of the firm's business or with the authority of the partner's partners.

> [!statute] s 10 PA 1890
> Where, by any wrongful act or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the firm, or with the authority of his co-partners, loss or injury is caused to any person not being a partner in the firm, or any penalty is incurred, the firm is liable therefor to the same extent as the partner so acting or omitting to act.

> [!statute] s 12 PA 1890
> Every partner is liable jointly with his co-partners and also severally for everything for which the firm while he is a partner therein becomes liable under either of the two last preceding sections. 

- s 10 covers all types of wrongdoing, including a dishonest breach of trust or fiduciary duty, and is not limited to common law torts ([[Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam [2002] 3 WLR 1913]])
- ss 5 and 10 do not make the other partners liable for breach of contract and deceit arising out of a fraudulent investment scheme ([[JJ Coughlan v Ruparelia [2003] EWCA Civ 1057]]).

## Enforcing Firm Liability

### Potential Defendants

The range of potential defendants is extensive, including:

- The partner with whom the person made the contract can be sued individually (privity of contract).
- Firm can be sued
	- Claim should start here if the partnership has a name and if it is appropriate to do so (CPR Part 7 PD 7 5A.1).
	- All those who were partners at the time are jointly liable to satisfy the judgment .
- Any person who was a partner at the time when the debt/ obligation was incurred can be sued individually.
- A person who left the firm before debt/ obligation incurred, or joined since, is generally not liable (s 17 PA 1890), but can be in cases of
	- 'Holding out'
	- Failure to give appropriate notice of retirement
	- Novation agreement.

Details of this joint liability are found in [Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/47/contents).

| Section | Provision |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s 1(1) | Any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise). |
| s 2(1) | Subject to subsection (3) below, in any proceedings for contribution under section 1 above the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage in question. |

### Suing the Firm

Usually most appropriate to sue the partners as a group of persons in the firm's name. Then the judgment can be enforced against the partnership assets, and potentially against assets owned personally by partners.

### 'Holding Out'

Where a creditor of a partnership has relied on a representation that a particular person was a partner in that firm, the creditor may be able to hold that person liable for the firm's debts (s 14 PA 1890).

- Applies even if the person was never a partner at the firm
- Representation may be oral, in writing or by conduct (previous course of dealing)
- Representation may be by the person themselves, or by another with their knowledge.

In [[Sangster v Biddulphs [2005] EWHC 658 (Ch)]], the test relied on for liability under s 14 was that from [[Nationwide Building Society v Lewis [1998] Ch 482]]. This was that for liability there had to be

(a) holding out,  
(b) reliance thereon, and  
(c) the consequent giving of credit to the firm.

### Failure to Notify Leaving

The firm’s debts can be enforced against all those who were partners at the time when the debt or obligation was incurred. Although a person may retire from a partnership, they remain liable on those contracts already made. The terms for the purchase of the partner’s share in the business should include a provision whereby the purchasing partner(s) indemnify the partner against liability for any such debts which were taken into account in valuing the partner’s share.

> [!action]
> When a partner leaves the partnership, the partner must give notice of their leaving since otherwise the partner may become liable for the acts of their former partner(s) done after the partner leaves the firm, if the creditor is unaware that the partner has left. s 36 prescribes the notices which the partner should give:
> 
> 1. Actual notice (e.g., by sending out standard letters announcing the partner is leaving) to all those who have dealt with the firm prior to the partner leaving (s 36(1)); and
> 2. An advertisement in the London Gazette as notice to any person who did not deal with the firm prior to the date of that partner's retirement or expulsion (s 36(2)).

A creditor who was unaware of the partner’s leaving and who can establish that the type of notice appropriate to the creditor (as above) was not given, will be able to sue the former partner for the firm’s debt, in spite of the fact that he has ceased to be a partner. The principle on which s 36 is based, unlike that on which s 14 is based, does not depend on the creditor having relied on some representation at the time of the transaction. Rather the creditor is given the right to assume that the membership of the firm continues unchanged until notice of the prescribed type (as above) is given. It follows that, if the creditor was never aware that the person had been a partner, no notice of any sort will be required since that creditor cannot be assuming the continuance of that person in the partnership (s 36(3)).

If the reason for ceasing to be a partner is death or bankruptcy (rather than retirement or expulsion), no notice of the event is required. The estate of the deceased or bankrupt partner is not liable for events occurring after the death or bankruptcy.

### Novation Agreement

A novation agreement is a tripartite contract involving:

1. the creditor of the firm,
2. the partners at the time the contract with the creditor was made, and
3. the newly constituted partnership.

> [!example]
> Say one partner leaves and another joins. Under a contract of novation, it can be agreed that a creditor will release the initial partners and the new partners will take over this liability. 

> [!question] What if a partner retires and no new partner retires?
> To make the novation contractually binding, either there must be consideration for the creditor's promise to release the retiring partner from liability, or the contract must be executed as a deed. 

## Inability to Pay

### General Rule

- A creditor can sue the firm as a group of persons or individually sue any of the persons liable as partners.
- If they sue an individual who can't pay, they are at liberty to commence fresh proceedings against another/ the firm.
- Judgment against the firm can be enforced against the private assets of any person liable as partner.
- If impossible to satisfy, the firm is insolvent and all individuals are insolvent.
- Insolvency proceedings likely to follow.

### Insolvency

The law on insolvency of a partnership and of its partners individually is governed by the Insolvent Partnerships Order 1994 (SI 1994/2421) (as amended by SI 2002/1308) and the Insolvency Act 1986.

> [!tip] Principle
> 
> Although a partnership is not a person in its own right, nevertheless an insolvent partnership may be wound up as an unregistered company or may avail itself of the
> rescue procedures available to companies, such as a ‘voluntary arrangement’ with creditors or an ‘administration order’ of the court.

With a partnership joint venture involving companies, the agreement will need to provide a

mechanism to unwind the joint venture in the event that one party may be heading for

insolvency.
