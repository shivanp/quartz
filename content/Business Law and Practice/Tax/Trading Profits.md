# Trading Profits

| Corporate structure | Income profits taxation |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Sole trader         | Income tax              |
| Company             | Corporation tax         |
| Partnership         | Income tax of partners/ corporation tax of corporate partners.                         |

Relevant legislation:

- Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (ITTOIA 2005)
- Corporation Tax Act 2009 (CTA 2009)
- Corporation Tax Act 2010 (CTA 2010)

## Calculation

$\text{Trading profits} = \text{Chargeable receipts} - \text{Deductible expenditure} - \text{Capital allowance}$

Very small businesses may be allowed to work on a cash basis, but the vast majority of businesses must calculate trading profits.

## Chargeable Receipts

“Trade” is given its ordinary meaning of operations of a commercial character.

## Deductible Expenditure

```ad-statute
title: s 24 ITTOIA 2005 - Expenses not wholly and exclusively for trade and unconnected losses

(1) In calculating the profits of a trade, no deduction is allowed for—
- (a) expenses not incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade, or
- (b) losses not connected with or arising out of the trade.

(2) If an expense is incurred for more than one purpose, this section does not prohibit a deduction for any identifiable part or identifiable proportion of the expense which is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade.
```

Must deduct:

- any expenditure of an income nature,
	- Expenditure incurred for the purpose of enabling the trader to sell the item at a profit.
	- Income expenditure usually has the quality of recurrence.
- which has been incurred 'wholly and exclusively' for the trade, and
	- So cannot be for a dual purpose.
	- e.g., having a restaurant meal while working away from home is for the dual purpose of eating ([[Caillebotte v Quinn [1975] 1 WLR 731]]).
	- But realistically, HMRC allows some expenses to be apportioned, so part is deductible.
- deduction of which is not prohibited by statute.

Commonly deducted expenses include salaries, rent, utility charges, stock, business rates and stationery.

## Capital Allowances

Expenditure on capital items cannot in principle be deducted from chargeable receipts because it is not of a capital nature.

But this could cause cash flow difficulties, so legislation allows a specified amount of the cost to be deducted each year in calculating trading profits. Principally applies to plant and machinery.

This is the equivalent of amortisation in accounting.

```ad-defn
title: Capital allowances
Under the Capital Allowances Act 2001 (CAA 2001), where expenditure is incurred on certain assets or activities, a percentage of the capital expenditure will be allowed as a deduction in calculating trading profits in a given accounting period. These deductions are known as capital allowances.
```

### Plant and Machinery

Not defined anywhere: case law says apparatus used to carry out the business.

For most qualifying assets, the taxpayer is allowed, in each 12-month accounting  
period of ownership of the asset, to deduct a ‘writing down allowance’ of up to **18%** of the reducing balance of the cost of the asset in calculating their trading profits (CAA 2001, ss 52–59).

#### Sale of Assets

If plant/ machinery is sold:

- At a profit, there may be a balancing charge
- At a loss, there may be a balancing allowance.

These ensure that the taxpayer had relief for exactly the amount by which the asset diminished.

#### Pooling

Generally, all expenditure on plant and machinery is pooled together and the writing down allowance given each year on the balance of expenditure.

```ad-statute
title: s 55 CAA 2001 - Determination of entitlement or liability

(1) Whether a person is entitled to a writing-down allowance or a balancing allowance, or liable to a balancing charge, for a chargeable period is determined separately for each pool of qualifying expenditure and depends on—
- (a) the available qualifying expenditure in that pool for that period (“AQE”), and
- (b) the total of any disposal receipts to be brought into account in that pool for that period (“TDR”).

(2) If AQE exceeds TDR, the person is entitled to a writing-down allowance or a balancing allowance for the period.

(3) If TDR exceeds AQE, the person is liable to a balancing charge for the period.

(4) The entitlement under subsection (2) is to a writing-down allowance except for the final chargeable period when it is to a balancing allowance.
```

Generally, no balancing allowance or charge should occur until the whole pool is sold/ trade discontinued.

If the written-down value of the pool being used for an accounting period is ever £1,000 or less, the trader has the option of claiming a writing down allowance big enough to eliminate the pool.

#### Annual Investment Allowance

Every ongoing business receives an annual investment allowance up to £1,000,000. So the first £1,000,000 of fresh **qualifying** expenditure on plant and machinery will be fully deductible.

```ad-important
The key here is "qualifying". So if you're not qualifying (meaning would usually qualify for 18% deduction, use the annual investment allowance).
```

Note that this was meant to be a temporary measure from £200,000, but hasn't been changed.

Note this can apply to second hand machinery being purchased. So either apply AIA or super-deduction, but never both.

#### Super-deduction

'Temporary' (until 31/03/23) capital allowances for **companies** investing in **new** **qualifying** plant and machinery over COVID-19: 130% super-deduction rather than the normal 18% deduction.

Expenditure on assets usually attracting a 6% (e.g., life-long assets) receive first year allowance of 50%.

```ad-warning
Only applies to companies.
```

#### Special Rules

- Structures and buildings
	- Capital Allowances (Structures and Buildings Allowances) Regulations 2019
	- Flat 3% allowance on qualifying expenditure incurred on construction, renovation or conversion of commercial structures.
	- Confined to physical construction, does not include cost of land.
- Short life assets (CAA 2001, ss 83-89)
	- If a business thinks an asset will have a useful working life of $<8$ years, election can be made (within 2 years) to treat the asset as a short-life asset.
- Life-long assets and integral features (CAA 2001, s 33A and ss 90-104E)
	- Expected working life of $\geq 25$ years.
	- “Integral features” includes escalators, electrical and lighting etc.
	- Only qualify for 6% writing down allowance.
	- Eligible for AIA.

## Trading Loss Relief

If there is a trading loss, there is no trading income. Relief on trading loss available for tax purposes.

Where relief can be claimed under more than one provision, the taxpayer can elect which to claim, or can claim more than one if there is a big enough loss.

### Start-up Loss Relief (ss 72-81 ITA 2007)

Start-up relief applies if the taxpayer suffers a loss which is assessed in any of the first 4 years of a business. The loss can be carried back and set against the taxpayer's total income in 3 years prior to the tax year of the loss.

The loss must be set against earlier years before later years. there is a limit of £50,000.

### Carry-across Relief (ss 64-71 ITA 2007)

#### Set Off Against Total Income (s 64 ITA 2007)

Trading loss arising in an accounting period is treated as a loss of the tax year in which the accounting period ends. Can be set against:

- Taxpayer's total income in the loss-making year, or
- Taxpayer's total income in preceding year.

If the loss is big enough, can also set against a combination of these two years (but using up one first).

COVID-19 extension: trading losses can be carried back for 3 years. Must be set against later years first, and carry-back to 2nd and 3rd years is £2 million.

#### Set Off Against Capital Gains (s 71 ITA 2007)

After s 64 relief, further relief can be obtained by setting against a taxpayer's chargeable capital gains for that tax year.

### Carry-forward Relief (ss 83-85 ITA 2007)

A loss can be carried forward and set against subsequent **profits** which the trade produces, taking earlier years first.

Note the qualifications:

- Must wait for future profits before relief can be claimed
- Can only set against profits, not income or capital.
- BUT can carry forward indefinitely until a profit arises.
- No cap on the amount which can be claimed.

#### Carry Back of Terminal Trading Loss (ss 89-94 ITA 2007)

If there is a trading loss in the last 12 months of the trade, it can be carried across trading profits made in the final tax year and then carried back to the 3 years prior.

Does not allow relief against non-trading income or capital gains.

4 years in which to claim relief. No cap.

### Carry-forward Relief on Incorporation

Losses can be carried forward and set against income which the taxpayer receives from the company. At least 80% of the consideration for the transfer must consist of shares in the company.

Can be carried forward indefinitely, no cap.

### Restrictions

Under Finance Act 2013, there is a cap on relief which can be claimed in any tax year, set as the greater of:

- £50,000, or
- 25% of taxpayer's total income.

The cap only relates to income from sources other than the trade which produced the loss.

Applies to start-up relief, carry-across/ carry-back relief, interest relief on loans to close companies and interest relief for partnership investment.
