# Business Accounts

## Tutorial

### Setting up Business

```ad-defn
title: Capital

The amount a business owes its owner.
```

### P&L Account

Short term items are classified as expenses of the business. Items providing a benefit for several years are assets.

$$
Profit = Income - Expenses
$$

### Income Statement

Assets and liabilities are shown. One of the assets is usually cash.

```ad-defn
title: Fixed and current assets

Fixed assets are major assets bought to help the business function. Current assets are cash and liquid assets, such as debtors and stock. 
```

$$
\text{Net assets} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}
$$

Net assets represent the net worth of the business to the owner. This is the first thing which is looked at when valuing a business/ deciding whether to invest in a business.

But figures can be easily manipulated–for example by not depreciating fixed assets correctly, or by not taking into account that a percentage of debtors will likely not pay. Good practice to make an allowance for possible bad debts.

## Introduction

Keeping business accounts is obviously useful, to both internal and external users, as well as HMRC.

### Accountants and Auditors

Generally, accountants are hired to prepare business accounts, which are then reported. Registered auditors are authorised to sign a statutory audit report. Auditors must provide an opinion about whether accounts give a true and fair view of the affairs of the company and its profits. They are under an obligation to the members of the company and to a professional body.

### Taxes

Accounts are important for taxes. If the business is unincorporated, the proprietor(s) will include business profit in their personal income tax returns. If the business is a company, the company is liable for corporation tax.

A business with employees will operate a PAYE scheme (Pay As You Earn). The employer deducts income tax and pays it straight to HMRC. National Insurance contributions are also deducted. VAT charged/ paid must also be recorded, and accounted for to the government each quarter.

### Regulation

UK Financial Reporting Council lays down standards of financial accounting and reporting (Financial Reporting Standards; FRSs). But moving to a new international standard.

### Accounts

On a daily basis, a business must keep a record of income, expenses, assets and liabilities.

| Term        | Definition                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Income      | What the business is trying to produce.                                                                                                                                       |
| Expenses    | Items paid, the benefit of which is obtained and exhausted in a relatively short time and where the expenditure is necessary to maintain the earning capacity of the business. |
| Assets      | Expenditure giving rise to a benefit which can be spread over a longer period and will increase the earning capacity of the business.                                         |
| Liabilities | Amounts owing from the business.                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Double Entry Bookkeeping

```ad-defn
title: Bookkeeping
The process of recording financial transactions in the accounting records of a business.
```

The double entry system was developed by Venetian traders in the 1400s and is still used to this day. The idea is that there are two aspects to every transaction.

```ad-example
1. The business pays cash to buy premises
	1. The business has less cash
	1. The business has acquired premises
2. The business pays wages
	1. The business has less cash
	1. The business has incurred an expense
3. The client pays the business owed money
	1. The business has lost the debt it was owed
	1. The business has more cash
```

### Rules for Recording Transactions

| Left column | Right column |
| :--- | :--- |
| Expense incurred | Income earned |
| Asset acquired/increased | Asset disposed of/reduced |
| Liability reduced/extinguished | Liability incurred/increased |
| Cash gained | Cash paid |

A key principle is that the business is regarded as completely separate from the proprietor. So the initial capital is incurred as a liability to the proprietor.

#### Debit and Credit

The LHS is debit and the RHS is credit, shortened to DR and CR respectively.

Accounts are usually recorded in the form:

| Name of Account |  |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Date | Details | DR | CR | Balance |
|  |  |  |  |  |

If DR exceeds the CR entry, the balance is described as a DR balance.

#### Business Models

Trading businesses make money by buying and selling stock, either for cash or on credit. The purchase of stock is considered an expense of the business and recorded in the purchases account. The business earns income by selling stock, recorded in the sales account.

Professionals do not sell trading stock, they sell services. The charge for professional services is recorded as a CR entry on an income account (often as “profit costs”), and the client's debt is recorded as a DR entry in the name of a client. When the client pays, the solicitor will record a receipt of cash and the loss of the debt owed by the client to the business.

#### Cash and Ledger Accounts

The 'cash' account is in reality a record of receipts into and payments out of the bank account. But a business will usually need some petty cash in the office to cover day-to-day expenses–these transactions are recorded in a petty cash account.

```ad-defn
All accounts apart from the cash account are referred to as ledger accounts. There is a single cash account: the petty cash account.
``` 

#### Drawings

It is common to record withdrawals by the proprietor in a separate 'Drawings' account, rather than recording withdrawals on the capital account each time. The drawings account is a temporary account; at the end of the accounting period, any balance is transferred to the capital account.

#### Trial Balance

Businesses will check their bookkeeping periodically. If every transaction has been properly recorded, $$

\sum \text{DR entries} = \sum \text{CR entries}

$$

```ad-defn
The process of adding together all DR and CR balances and comparing totals is known as preparing a Trial Balance. 
```

Note that this is only a check but cannot reveal all errors, e.g., if the bookkeeper has failed to make any entries relating to a particular transaction.

## Final Accounts

### Introduction

The double entry system records aren't very helpful in seeing how a business is doing. To present key information about how a business is doing, two accounts are prepared:

- P&L account ('Income Statement') to present profitability
- Balance sheet ('Statement of Financial Position') to present value of business.

These end-of-year accounts are collectively known as financial accounts. The starting point for creating these is the Trial Balance.

### P&L Statement

Accounting period is usually 1 year.

Income - Expenses = Profit.

> [!note]  
> Only items appearing on the trial balance which can be classified as income and expenses will appear on the P&L account.

So step 1 is preparing trial balance and step 2 is distinguishing between income & expenses and assets & liabilities.

#### Preparation

P&L usually set out vertically; with income first, followed by expenses below, and profit at the bottom. The total of expenses will be shown in brackets, since it is negative. Totals are shown on the right-hand side, conventionally.

#### Trading Accounts

A business buying and selling goods has not only a P&L but also a preliminary account called a Trading Account. This shows the income from the sales less the cost of those sales (the cost of buying trading stock), which is the gross profit. This is carried forward to the P&L account, where any other income is added and expenses of running the business subtracted to produce the net profit.

#### Balance Sheet

Lists the assets and liabilities of the business, and is accurate only for one day (the last day of the accounting period). The basic formula is $$
\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \text{Net worth of business}
$$

The balance sheet shows what the business is worth to the proprietor, so it splits the assets–liabilities owed to third parties ('Employment of Capital'), and the amount owed to the proprietor as capital ('Capital Employed'). The two amounts should be the same.

$\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}$ is shown vertically. Liabilities are commonly labelled 'Financed By' or 'Represented By'.

Commonly, assets are divided into:

- Fixed assets–bought not for resale but to improve the efficiency of the business
- Current assets–short-term assets, often known as circulating assets

and liabilities are divided into

- Current liabilities–repayable in $\leq 12$ months
- Long-term liabilities–repayable in $> 12$ months.

Conventionally, assets are listed in decreasing order of permeance (i.e., increasing order of liquidity). The balance sheet shows current liabilities deducted from current assets to give a figure called 'net current assets'.

A balance sheet usually shows current assets–current liabilities = net current assets. This figure represents the liquid funds available to the business. Low or negative net current assets are a sign of financial difficulty.

Net assets will equal the amount owing to the proprietor as capital at the end of the year.

$$
\text{Capital Employed} = \text{Capital balance} + \text{Net Profit} - \text{Withdrawals}
$$

#### Client Bank Account

The bank account containing money held for clients is usually equalled by the amount a firm 'owes' to clients, so it is usually shown as a self-cancelling item on the balance sheet, after net current assets.

> [!summary]
> 1. The Final Accounts of a business comprise a Profit and Loss Account and a Balance Sheet.
> 2. A Profit and Loss Account shows income less expenses to give net profit.
> 3. Businesses which buy and sell goods have a Trading Account as well as a Profit and Loss Account. The Trading Account shows income from sales, less the cost of goods sold to give gross profit. The Profit and Loss Account shows gross profit less expenses to give net profit.
> 4. The Balance Sheet shows assets and liabilities. It is set out as follows:
> 	1. first fixed assets are added together;
> 	2. then the net current assets figure is calculated–this is total current assets less total liabilities;
> 	3. the total fixed assets and net current assets are added together;
> 	4. any long-term liabilities are deducted;
> 	5. the result is labelled ‘Net Assets’;
> 	6. it should equal the new capital figure found by adding net profit to the figure for capital on the Trial Balance and deducting drawings.

## Adjustments

### Introduction

Final Accounts of most businesses are prepared and adjusted on the 'accruals basis'. This requires that income and expenditure are recorded in the period to which they relate, rather than that in which payment or receipt occurs.

This requires Final Accounts to include all income earned during the period, irrespective of whether cash has been received or bills delivered.

Essentially, it is a process of matching the expense to the period in which the benefit of the expense was obtained, and to match the income to the period in which the work producing the income was done.

> [!important]  
> 1. Adjustments are always made after the preparation of the Trial Balance at the end of the accounting period.
> 2. Each adjustment will always be reflected on both the P&L Account and the Balance Sheet.

#### Outstanding Expenses

If there is an expense relating to the current period which has not yet been paid, the Trial Balance will be updated to show the true expense for the current accounting period. This adjustment will be reflected on the balance sheet as a current liability. It is common for a business to add up all unpaid expenses at year-end and label them 'Accruals'.

#### Payments in Advance

This is the opposite; where a business pays an expense this year but will not get the benefit until later on (e.g., rent paid in advance). The amount of the payment in advance is shown on the Balance Sheet as a current asset (usually after cash). The 'asset' is the benefit of the payment having already been made. Usual to add up all payments in advance for the year and show a composite figure labelled 'Prepayments'.

#### Work in Progress

The estimated value of work done but not yet billed increases the profit costs properly attributable to the current period and must be added to the balance on the profit costs account appearing on the Trial Balance. This must be shown on the income section of the P&L, though it is usual to show the costs actually billed and value of work in progress as two separate items. The figure will also appear as an additional item in the current assets section of the balance sheet (usually shown first).

> [!note]  
> The modern approach is to calculate work in progress by treating the right to payment as accruing gradually as the work is done, so much of the work in progress is actually shown as part of the debtors figure, rather than a separate item.

#### Closing Stock

It is necessary for a trading business to make an adjustment for the value of any stock purchased during the year and left unsold at the end of the year. This is done by showing the value of closing stock appearing in the Trading Account as a deduction from purchases in order to calculate the cost of goods sold. It also appears as an additional item in the current assets section, showing that the business will start the next accounting year with the benefit of that stock having been purchased. The value of opening stock must also be taken into account when calculating the cost of goods sold.

$$
\text{Cost of Goods Sold} = \text{Purchases} + \text{Opening Stock} - \text{Closing Stock}
$$

```ad-warning
By convention, stock is valued in the Final Accounts at the lower of its acquisition cost or its realisable value.
```

The value given for closing stock is always an estimate–the business cannot predict with total accuracy how much of the remaining stock it will be able to sell (e.g., clothing which has gone out of fashion).

#### Bad and Doubtful Debts

Debtors are a current asset of the business, so can increase the net value of the business. A business will periodically review its debtors to decide whether any should be declared bad and written off. The debtor is then no longer shown as owing the firm money. Bad debts are regarded as an expense of the business–and will appear in the P&L statement as an additional expense labelled 'bad debts'.

Note that at the end of the accounting period before preparing the final accounts, it is normal to reassess whether there are any bad debts.

#### Doubtful Debts

After the bad debts have been written off, there may still be debtors who may or may not pay. An adjustment is made to take into account this uncertainty. A separate item, 'Provision for Doubtful Debts', is added to the P&L statement.

#### Depreciation

Depreciation is accumulated over the life of an asset, such as a piece of machinery. There are different methods for calculating deprecation–either linearly or using a 'reducing balance' method.

> [!tip]  
> It is common:
> - to depreciate all assets held at the end of an accounting period for the entire accounting period, regardless of when in the period they were purchased
> - not to depreciate assets sold part way through an accounting period.

#### Revaluation

Assets like premises may slowly appreciate in value from their book value. The asset can be revalued, and the new value put on the balance sheet. This is often done just before bringing on a new partner, so that the increase in value is shown as belonging to the original proprietor.

#### Disposal of Fixed Asset

Is an asset is sold for book value, the transaction appears only on the balance sheet, since there is only a transfer of the type of asset the business owns (into cash).

If the disposal is not at book value, the excess/shortfall will be a profit/loss. Note that these should be shown separately on the accounts from trading profits/ losses.

## Partnership Accounts

In a partnership, need to record the capital contributed by each partner, profit owed to each partner, and amount withdrawn during the year by the partner. The partners will either have an agreement themselves, or the Partnership Act 1890 will imply terms into the business arrangement.

Each partner has a capital account in their own names. The capital account also shows the partner's share of an increase/ decrease in value of an asset recorded in the accounts (either explicitly agreed, else in the same ratio as profits).

Partners may receive both salaries (fixed) and 'interest on capital', as well as a share of the profits.

| Payment             | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Salary              | Fixed. Common where one partner is doing more of the day-to-day running of the business. |
| Interest on capital | Percentage of initial capital invested, which is returned every year.                    |
| Profit-sharing      | Any remaining profits shared.                                                            |

### Appropriation Account

P&L account is extended to an appropriation account on which the allocation of net profit among the partners is shown.

### Current Account

It is usual to have separate current accounts for each partner to which the appropriation of net profit is added and from which drawings are deducted. This keeps everything accountable and neat.

#### Balance Sheet

Capital and current account balances of each partner are shown separately on the Balance Sheet in the Capital Employed section. This is often done in the appendix to avoid clutter.

#### Partnership Changes

If there is a change, net profits apportioned and two appropriation accounts prepared.

#### Taxation

The senior partner of the firm makes a (tax) return of partnership income. HMRC makes a joint assessment to tax, based on each partner's share of profit less reliefs and charges. Tax liabilities of individual partners are not shown in partnership accounts.

# Income Tax

## Purpose

About 1/3 of UK tax receipts come from income tax, collected by HMRC. Individual taxed on total from all taxable incomes.

- Statute
	- Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007)
	- Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (ITTOIA 2005)
	- Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA 2003).
- Courts
	- Appeal by a taxpayer heard by the First-tier Tribunal, with further appeals to the Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber), and for points of law to [[Court of Appeal]] --> [[Supreme Court]].
- Official statements
	- Produced by HMRC to explain and qualify legislation.
	- Not binding on courts.
	- Extra-Statutory Concessions
		- HMRC waives right to collect tax which would otherwise be due if taxpayer satisfies terms.
		- Statements of Practice
			- Announced by press release, published in professional journals
			- Indicate HMRC's views of particular tax provisions.
- Tax year: 6th April–5th April.
- Income tax subject to general anti-abuse rules ('GAAR') introduced by Finance Act 2013.

## Income

Income tax is recurrent, whereas capital transactions are usually one-off. Income tax paid by individuals, partnerships, personal representatives and trustees. Companies pay corporation tax. There are tax-efficient ways of giving to charity.

```ad-example
title: Income
- Interest
- Dividends
- Salary/ wages
- Rent
```

```ad-example
title: Capital
- Sale of shares
- Buying a house
- Sale of antique
```

 Income can be received gross (trading income, property income), or net–tax-deducted (employment income, PAYE). Sources of income for an individual include trading income, employment income, property income and saving and investment income.

Categorised as:

| Category                                | Sources of income                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-savings non-dividend income (NSNDI) | Trading income, employment income, property income. |
| Savings income                          | Savings and investment income                       |
| Dividend income                         | Savings and investment income.                                                     |

## Calculation

1. Calculate total income
	- Trading profits
	- Employment/ pensions income
	- Interest from banks
	- Investment income (interest, annuities, dividends)
	- Property income
2. Deduct allowable reliefs
	- Interest payments on a loan to:
		- Buy a share in a partnership
		- Invest in a close company
		- Personal representative to pay IHT.
3. Deduct personal allowance
	- £12,570
	- Reduces by £1 for every £2 of income over £100,000
	- £0 if income over £125,140.
	- Personal Savings Allowance (PSA):
		- Basic rate: £1,000 at 0%
		- Higher rate: £500 at 0%
		- Additional rate: £0
	- Dividend allowance
		- £2,000 at 0%
	- These are classified as nil rate bands, not exemptions.
		- The treatment of these allowances as nil rate bands has the potential to take a taxpayer into a higher tax band, increasing the amount of tax payable.
4. Calculate tax for each separate income stream at the applicable rate
	1. £37,700 basic rate
	2. £150,000 higher rate
	3. Above this, additional rate.
5. Calculate overall tax available.
	- Add all the tax paid
	- Credit for tax already paid.

## Total Income

| Statute            | Source                         | Details                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Part 2 ITTOIA 2005 | Trading income                 | Applies to self-employed, including sole traders and partnerships. |
| Part 3 ITTOIA 2005 | Property income                | Rents and other receipts from land                                 |
| Part 4 ITTOIA 2005 | Savings and investment income  | Interest, annuities, dividends                                     |
| Part 5 ITTOIA 2005 | Miscellaneous income           | Annual income not otherwise charged                                |
| ITEPA 2003         | Employment and pensions income | Income arising out of employment, including social security payments.                                                                   |

Income is divided into chargeable sources because each part has its own rules for calculating the amount of income; the income is actually net of certain allowable expenses of an income nature (e.g., repairs to a property).

### Exempt Income

Exempt items include:

- Certain State benefits
- Interest on Savings Certificates
- Scholarships
- Interest on damages for personal injuries/ death
- Income from investments in ISAs
- Gross income $\leq £7,500$ from letting a furnished room in taxpayer's home
- Annual payments under certain insurance policies
- Premium bond winnings.

![[income-streams.png]]

### Tax Deducted at Source

Most employment income is deducted at source. Sums received after deduction at source must be grossed to find the original sum from which the tax was deducted.

The PAYE system takes into account personal allowances etc. to deduct tax at mostly the appropriate rate. Taxpayers are given a P60 certificate of tax paid by their employer, which they can then use as the basis of filing a tax return if they have other income sources.

## Allowable Reliefs

Interest payments on qualifying loans receive tax relief. These include:

- A loan to buy a share in a partnership or contribute capital/ make a loan to a partnership.
- A loan to invest in a close trading company
- A loan to personal representatives to pay income tax.

Subject to a cap of £50,000, or 25% of income, whichever greater

## Personal Allowances

Depends on the taxpayer's personal circumstances rather than the type of income. Main factors: level of total income and any disability allowances.

- Personal Allowance is £12,570, until at least 2026
- Subject to an income limit of £100,000: reduced by £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000
- Applies in order to: NSNDI, then savings income, then dividend income
- Each spouse independently liable for tax on their own income and has their own personal allowance.

### Marriage Allowance

Since April 2015: transferable 'marriage allowance'. Where one spouse/ partner does not have enough income to use their personal allowance fully, can transfer £1,260 to spouse/ civil partner.

### Blind Person's Allowance

£2,600 allowance.

### Property and Trading Allowances

Allowances for small amounts of property and trading income available to all taxpayers.

| Amount of gross property/ trading income | Effect                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\leq £1,000$                            | Income not subject to income tax, no need to submit a tax return |
| $>£1,000$                                | Taxpayer can choose to take £1,000 deduction against gross income/ deduct actual expenses.                                                                  |

### Personal Savings and Dividend

PSA can be set against savings income.

| Tax rate                 | Income band (Taxable Income) | Allowance       |
|:------------------------ |:---------------------------- |:--------------- |
| Basic rate taxpayer      | £0-£37,700                   | £1,000 tax free |
| Higher rate taxpayer     | £37,701-£150,000             | £500 tax free   |
| Additional rate taxpayer | £150,001 and above           | No allowance    |

#### Dividend Allowance

All taxpayers entitled to £2,000.

#### Nil Rate Bands

Importantly, the above allowances are not tax exemptions but nil rates for each type of income.

So allowances are **not** set off to reduce taxable income; only personal allowance is relevant for calculating taxable income.

## Rates of Tax

$\text{Taxable income} - \text{S\&D income} = \text{Taxable NSNDI}$

Note NSNDI is taxed at a higher rate than savings and dividend income.

### Order of Taxation

Income taxed in slices:

1. NSNDI
2. Savings income
3. Dividend income

### Savings Income

|                                      Savings Income                                       |     |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---:|

|                                     PSA (taxed @ 0%)                                      |     |
|                             Remaining Taxable Savings Income                              |     |
| This is the amount of savings income which will be subject to tax at the relevant rate(s) |     |

| Starting rate for savings of 0% | £0-£5,000        |
|:------------------------------- |:---------------- |
| Savings basic rate of 20%       | £5,001-£37,700   |
| Savings higher rate of 40%      | £37,701-£150,000 |
| Savings additional rate of 45%  | over £150,000    |

Dealing with PSA checklist:

1. Tax PSA at 0%
2. Calculate relevant rate of tax from (PSA + taxable NSNDI) total
3. Tax remaining savings income at the appropriate rate, using the table above.

## Collection of Income Tax

2 methods of collection:

- Deduction at source
	- Trading profits (ITTOIA 2005, Part 2)
	- Rent (ITTOIA 2005, Part 3)
- Self-assessment.
	- Taxpayer completes annual tax return
	- Tax returns issued soon after **5 April**.
	- Statutory obligation to notify HMRC of an income liable to tax, even if no tax return received.

### Dates for Payment

Online tax return and any payment must be filed by **31 January** following the tax year to which the return relates.

Taxpayer automatically required to make two payments on account towards the income tax due for the year. No payments on account are required if this relevant amount is below a certain rate, set so most employees and pensioners do not have to make payments on account.

### Penalties

- Interest charged on any amount of tax unpaid at the due date of payment.
- Fixed penalties for late payment/ non-payment.
- Statutory requirement to maintain adequate records to support the return.

# Capital Gains Tax

Distinguish CGT with income tax. Capital Gains Tax is a one-off tax on the difference in value of an asset when acquired and when disposed of.

Introduced in 1965 to stop people avoiding income tax. Statute: Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.

```ad-defn
Capital gains tax is charged on the chargeable gains made by a chargeable person on the disposal of chargeable assets in a tax year (6th April - 5th April)
```

## Calculation

1. Identify the chargeable disposal
	- A chargeable person
		- Individuals
		- Trustees
		- Personal representatives
		- Partners in a business.
	- Makes a chargeable disposal
		- Dispose giving ordinary meaning
		- Divesting/ change of ownership
		- Gift is chargeable disposal–taxed as if the asset had been sold at market value.
		- Does not include death; PRs get all the assets inclusive of all increase in value.
	- Of a chargeable asset.
		- Excluded: motor vehicles, national savings certificates and sterling.
2. Calculate the gain or loss
	1. Proceeds of disposal
		1. Sale price/ market value where the disposal is a gift/ sale at an undervalue.
	2. Minus incidental costs of disposal
		1. e.g., stockbroker fees/ estate agent commission.
	3. Minus initial expenditure and incidental costs
		1. Solicitor & accountant fees
	4. Minus subsequent expenditure
		1. e.g., cost of building extension on property
		2. Legal fees incurred in defending asset, e.g., family dispute.
3. Consider reliefs
	1. Non-business assets
		1. Main dwelling home–v important exception.
	2. Business assets (aims to encourage investment)
		1. Hold over relief–gifts on qualifying assets. Donor has no CGT liability; donee has no liability until they dispose of the asset at some time in the future.
		2. Roll over relief on incorporation
			1. e.g., sole trader selling assets to a company in return for shares. The gain made on disposal of business is rolled into the shares.
		3. Roll over relief on replacement of qualifying business assets. Postpones payment of CGT on the old asset until disposal of the replacement asset.
		4. Business asset disposal relief.
			1. Limits tax on qualifying gain to a flat rate of 10%.
4. Aggregate gains and deduct annual exemption
	1. Annual exemption currently £12,300
	2. Basic rate: 10%, higher rate: 20%
		1. If an individual’s gains and taxable income added together do not exceed the threshold for basic rate income tax (£37,700), the rate of tax on the gains is 10%.
		2. If an individual’s gains and taxable income added together exceed the basic rate income tax threshold, any part of the gains up to the basic rate threshold is taxed at 10%, but the rate of tax on the gains that exceed the threshold is 20%.
	3. Plus 8% surcharge on residential property other than main dwelling.
	4. Business Asset Disposal Relief: flat 10% rate.
5. Apply correct rate of tax.
	- Gains are treated as if they were the top slice of the taxpayer’s income for the tax year.
	- Gains realised by trustees and personal representatives are taxed at a flat rate of 20% (or 28% on residential property).

## Special Rule

Disposals between spouses/ civil partners:

- No gain/ no loss
- Gain deferred: recipient spouse treated to have received the asset on the other spouse's acquisition cost, so will pay CGT on the combined increase in value when the asset is sold. Important tax planning point.

## Paying

- Assessed on the aggregate net gain of the current tax year, so must consider all disposals made during the tax year.
- Tax for individuals payable on/ before 31 January.
- Must also submit provisional calculations of any gains made from sale of residential property and pay tax due within 30 days of completion of the sale.

## Disposals

### Sale or Gift

Must have been a disposal of a chargeable asset. Disposal includes sale or gift. If a gift is made, the gain the taxpayer is deemed to have made on the asset is taxed. This is done using the market value of the asset at the time of gifting.

A sale/ gift of part of an asset also counts as a disposal.

But on death there is no disposal, so there is no charge to CGT. PRs acquire assets at the market value at the date of death (probate value). This wipes out gains accrued during deceased's lifetime–so these gains are not taxed.

## Calculation of Gains

The gain is generally the consideration for the disposal less expenditures:

- Initial expenditure
	- Cost price of asset
		- Or market value at date of acquisition if gifted
		- Or probate value if acquired through will/ intestacy
	- Incidental costs of acquisition
		- Legal fees, valuation fees, stamp duty.
- Subsequent expenditure
	- Renovations/ extensions.
	- Expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred in establishing, preserving or defending title to the asset.
- Incidental costs of disposal
	- e.g., legal fees, estate agent fees.

```ad-note
Expenditure deductible for income tax purposes not deductible for capital gains purposes.
```

### Indexation Allowance

Applies to gains realised before 6 April 2008, if asset had been owned between 31 March 1982 and 5 April 1998. Tried to remove inflationary gains. Not super relevant.

### Pre-31 March 1982

When a taxpayer has owned an asset since before this date, the gain which accrued before 31/03/82 is excluded from CGT calculations.

## Reliefs

### Tangible Moveable Property

Wasting assets - those with a predictable life $<50$ years - generally exempt.

Other tangible moveable property which goes up in value will be exempt from CGT if the disposal consideration is $\leq £6,000$.

### Private Dwelling House

A gain on the disposal by an individual of a dwelling house, including grounds of up to half a hectare, will be completely **exempt**, provided it has been occupied as their only or main residence through their period of ownership (ignoring the last 9 months of ownership).

### Damages for Personal Injury

Exempt from CGT. Note recovery or compensation can generally amount to the disposal of a chargeable asset.

### Hold-over Relief

Enables an individual to gift certain types of business asset without paying CGT. But then when the donee disposes of the asset, they will be charged CGT on both gains. Both the donor and donee must agree to claim hold-over relief.

### 'Roll-over' Relief

Also known as relief for replacement of business assets. Encourages expansion and investment in qualifying business assets by enabling the sale of those assets without an immediate charge to CGT, providing the proceeds are invested in other qualifying business assets.

### Roll-over Relief on Incorporation

Defers a CGT charge. Applies when an individual sells their interest in an unincorporated business to a company. Gain rolled over into shares received as consideration for the interest sold and CGT charge postponed until disposal of shares.

### Re-investment in Unquoted Shares

An individual can defer payment of CGT on any chargeable gain if the proceeds of sale are re-invested in certain shares of an unquoted trading company.

### Business Asset Disposal Relief

Relief available on gains made by individuals on disposals of:

- All or part of a trading business the individual is a sole trader/ partner in
- Shares in a trading company, if the individual holds $\geq 5\%$ voting shares (+ other conditions)
	- Exceptions to definition of trading company:
		- Finance company
		- Landlord/ letting company
		- Something else
- Assets owned and used by individual's trading company/ partnership.

## Annual Exemption

First slice of taxpayer's net capital gains exempt. Taxpayer can apply to gains which would otherwise attract a higher rate (e.g., apply their exemption to sale of residential property, when they also have capital gains from shares).

Currently, £12,300.

## Business Relief

Many reliefs have a trading requirement: that the assets being disposed of/ acquired by use in a 'trade' or be shares in a 'trading company'.

### Roll-over Relief, Qualifying Business Assets

(ss 152-159 TCGA 1992)

Allows the CGT due on the disposal of a 'qualifying asset' to be effectively postponed when sale money is used to buy a replacement qualifying asset.

#### Conditions

- Qualifying assets (s 155 TCGA 1992)
	- Includes land, buildings and goodwill
	- Asset must be used in the trade of the business
	- Company shares not qualifying assets
	- Fixed plant and machinery is a qualifying asset, but will rarely produce a gain, and when they do, relief is restricted if they are wasted assets.
- Applies to disposal of qualifying asset owned by sole trader partnership, individual partner, individual shareholder (if own $\geq 5\%$). Must be used in the **trade** of the business.
- Time limits
	- Replacement asset must be acquired within 1 year before/ 3 years after disposal of original asset.

#### Application

If the relief applies, any liability to CGT from the disposal can be postponing by rolling-over the gain on the disposal into the acquisition cost of the replacement asset. This means that the gain is notionally deducted from the acquisition cost of the replacement asset to give a lower acquisition cost for use in subsequent CGT calculations.

Roll over relief applies in a modified form to businesses.

### Hold-over Relief on Gifts

Hold-over relief on gifts is available to an individual who disposes of ‘business assets’ by way of gift or, to the extent of the gift element, by way of sale at an undervalue.

Does not exempt any of the chargeable gain, but acts to postpone any tax liability. Aims to allow business assets to be given away without a tax charge on the donor.

#### Conditions

- Gift or gift element
- Only the gain relating to a chargeable business asset can be held over.
	- Assets used in the donor's trade
	- Shares in a trading company not listed on a recognised exchange
	- Shares in a personal trading company ($\geq 5\%$ holding)
	- Assets owned by shareholder and used in personal trading company.
- For relief to apply, both donor and donee must elect, within 4 years.

#### Application

Chargeable gain calculated in the usual way, then deducted from the market value of the asset to get the 'acquisition cost' for the donee.

When donee disposes of an asset, this 'acquisition cost' is deducted from the sale price or market value to find gain of the donee.

### Roll Over Relief on Incorporation

Where a business is transferred by a sole trader or individual partners to a new or established company in return for shares in the company, a disposal occurs for CGT purposes. Any gain on the disposal can be referred.

#### Conditions

- Business transferred as a going concern
- Whole gain can be rolled over only if consideration is all in shares issued by the company.
- Business must be transferred with all of its assets.

#### Application of Relief

Gain on disposal rolled over by notionally deducting from the acquisition cost of shares. Where conditions for relief are met, HMRC will automatically apply it unless the taxpayer elects not to use it.

### Business Asset Disposal Relief

Applies on disposal of certain business assets.

#### Conditions

- Sole trader or partnership interests
	- Business disposed of as a going concern
	- Assets disposed of following cessation of business
	- Assets must have been used for the purpose of carrying out the business.
	- Business must have been owned by 2+ years.
- Company shares
	- Company is a personal trading company
	- Disponer is an employee officer of company.
- Associated disposals
	- Disposals of assets owned by an individual but used for the purposes of a business.

#### Application

Relief qualifies the gains concerned for a special tax rate of 10%. An individual cannot claim the relief for more than £1 million of qualifying gains. This is a lifetime restriction.

### Other Reliefs

- Investors' relief
	- Applies to gains made on disposal of qualifying shares in unlisted trading companies
	- Special 10% tax rate
	- £10 million lifetime cap
- Deferral relief on reinvestment in EIS shares
	- Enterprise Investment Scheme
	- Allows for unlimited deferral of capital gains arising on the disposal of any asset where the individual uses the gains to buy shares in certain qualifying companies.
- Other share based reliefs

### Annual Exemption

s 3 TCGA 1992: each tax year, a prescribed amount (£12,300) of an individual's gains is exempt from CGT.

### Tax Rates

*If part of the consideration is in cash and part in shares, may be possible to use the roll-over relief on incorporation for proportion of gain attributable to part exchanged for shares. This would leave BAD and annual exemption for the cash part.

# Corporation Tax

## Introduction

Companies resident in the UK are charged corporation tax–companies headquartered in UK or those with their essential functions in the UK. For a company, both income and capital are charged to corporation tax. But still need to work them out separately.

Subject to GAAR, introduced by Finance Act 2013.

## Calculation

1. Calculate income profits
	- Includes rent, interest and trading income
2. Calculate chargeable gains
	- Identify chargeable disposal
	- Calculate gain (NB Indexation)
		- Aim of indexation is to remove the effect of inflation from the gain, so only the gain is taxed.
		- HMRC publishes indexation tables.
	- Apply reliefs
	- Aggregate gains
3. Calculate total profits and apply reliefs against total profits
4. Calculate tax–19%.

## Trading Income

Recall that trading income = chargeable receipts less deductible expenditure less capital allowances.  

### Chargeable Receipts

Usually money received for the sale of goods and services.

### Deductible Expenditure

Tax legislation stipulates what is and is not deductible expenditure, so does not include e.g., bad debts, as in business accounts.

```ad-example
title: Examples of deductible expenditure for companies
1. Directors'/ employees' salaries or fees and benefits in kind. 
	1. So long as not excessive
	2. If paid for personal reasons and not wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade, then it will not be deductible. 
2. Contributions to an approved pension scheme for directors/ employees
3. Payment to director/ employee for termination of employment
	1. When made as compensation for loss of office/ employment, deductible expense
	2. When made in return for a non-compete undertaking, deductible under specifi provisions
4. Interest payments on borrowings
	1. Generally deductible under loan relationships rules, though there are limits on the amount of interest payments which can be deducted by listed companies. 
```

### Capital Allowances

Including:

- Writing down allowances
- Annual investment allowance
- Balancing charges/ allowances
- Temporary super-deduction
- Special first year allowance.

### Trading Losses

Company can carry forward losses under CTA 2010, s 45

## Chargeable Gains

### 1. Identify Chargeable Disposal

A chargeable disposal by a company can arise on a disposal of chargeable assets by way of either sale or gift. Chargeable assets for corporation tax purposes are defined broadly as for capital gains tax.

If a disposal forms part of the company's income stream, it will normally form part of the company's income profits rather than its chargeable gains (TCGA 1992, s 37). Special rules for intellectual property and goodwill.

#### Plant and Machinery

If capital allowances are available in relation to expenditure incurred on plant and machinery, the plant/ machinery will not benefit from the usual capital gains exemption for 'wasting assets'. In practice, unlikely to increase in value, so chargeable capital gain will not arise.

### 2. Calculate the gain/ Loss

| Deduction                        | = Total                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|                                  | Proceeds of disposal             |
| Less costs of disposal           | Net proceeds of disposal         |
| Less other allowable expenditure | Gain (before indexation) or Loss |
| Less indexation allowance        | Gain (after indexation)                                 |

If a company sells an asset at an undervalue:

- If the sale is just a bad bargain, the sale price will be used
- If there is a gift element, the market value of the asset will be used.
- If the sale is to a “connected person”, the sale will be deemed to take place at market value (TCGA 1992, s 286(5))
	- Company-person connection if a person (and their connected persons) control a company
	- Company-company connection if both controlled by a person (and their connected persons).

#### Indexation Allowance

Used when calculating the gain on an asset which has been owned between 31/03/1982 and date of disposal. Purpose: to remove inflationary gains from capital gains calculation, so a smaller gain is charged to tax.

The indexation allowance is calculated by multiplying the initial and subsequent expenditure by the indexation factor that covers the period from the date the expenditure was incurred (or 31 March 1982 if later) to the date of disposal of the asset (or 31 December 2017 if earlier).

- Allowance applied to initial and subsequent expenditure, but not to the costs of disposal.
- Where a company disposes of an asset which it owned on 31/03/82, gains before this date are excluded.
- Indexation can be used to reduce a gain to zero, but cannot precipitate loss.
- If there has been no overall deflation, no indexation allowance is available on expenditure.

### 3. Apply Reliefs

The range of reliefs available to companies is smaller than that available to individuals.

#### Roll-over Relief on Replacement of Qualifying Business Assets

ss 152-159 TCGA 1992.

Allows corporation tax due to the disposal of a 'qualifying asset' to be effectively postponed when the consideration obtained for the disposal is applied in acquiring another qualifying asset by way of replacement.

- Qualifying asset
	- Principle qualifying assets are land and buildings
	- Company must use the asset in its trade.
	- Company shares are not qualifying assets
	- Goodwill and IP subject to a separate roll-over relief.
	- Fixed plant and machinery is a qualifying asset but will rarely produce a gain, and roll-over relief on acquisition restricted if they are wasting assets.
	- Provided the asset disposed of and the asset acquired fall within the definition of qualifying assets, they do not need to be of the same type of asset.
- Time limits
	- Replacement asset must be acquired within 1 year before or 3 years after the disposal of the original asset.
- Application of relief
	- Any liability to corporation tax arising from the disposal can be postponed by rolling-over the gain (after indexation) on the disposal of the original asset into the acquisition cost of the replacement asset.

#### Exemption for Disposals of Substantial Shareholdings

A company's gains on disposal of shares it owns in another company are completely exempt from corporation tax if the conditions of the relief are met:

1. A disposing company must have owned $\geq 10\%$ of the ordinary shares in the other company for at least 12 months (continuously) within 6 years of the disposal
2. The company in which shares are held must have been a trading company throughout the 12 months of ownership.

Additional rules apply to disposals involving groups of companies.

## Total Profits and Reliefs

A company's income profits and any capital gains will be added together to produce total profits for the period. Certain reliefs are available:

- Qualifying donations to charity (Part 6 CTA 2010)
- Certain trading loss reliefs

| CTA 2010 | Relief                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| s 37     | Carry-across/carry-back relief |
| s 39     | Terminal carry-back relief     |
| s 45     | Carry-forward relief.          |

## Calculate Tax

If a company's accounting period is different from the corporation tax financial year (1 April to 31 March) and the rates of tax have changed from one financial year to the next, apply the different rates pro rata.

For the Financial Year 2022, there is a single main rate of 19%.

## Relief for Trading Loss

There are many CTA 2010 provisions allowing a company to deduct a trading loss from other profit to provide relief from corporation tax on these profits. If there are multiple options, the company can choose which to claim/ claim multiple.

### Carry-across/ Carry Back Relief

**ss 37-38 CTA 2010**: Trading loss can be carried across to be set against total profits for the same accounting period, and then the accounting period prior. There is a temporary extension to carry back 3 years–relief must be set against later years first, and carry-back to second and third years back is limited to £2 million.

Claim must be made within 2 years of the end of the accounting period of the loss.

### Terminal Carry-back Relief for Trading Losses

**s 39 CTA 2010**: when a company ceases to trade, a trading loss sustained in the final 12 months can be carried back and set against the company's total profits from any accounting period in the 3 years previously, taking later periods first.

Claim must be made within 2 years of the end of the accounting period of the loss.

### Carry-forward Relief for Trading Losses

ss 45-45B CTA 2010: can carry forward the trading loss for an accounting period and set it against subsequent profits.

- In the past, losses carried forward could only be set against profits of the same trade.
- However, trading losses arising in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2017 can be set against the company’s total profits in the **next** accounting period, provided that certain conditions are met.
- Can relieve £5 million deductions allowance + 50% of remaining total profits after deduction of allowance.
- Any losses not relieved can be carried forward indefinitely and set against future profits of the same trade.

| Section of CTA 2010                    | When will the loss have occurred? | Against what will the loss be set?                                                                  | Which accounting periods are relevant?                                                                                                                                            |

## Corporation Tax on Goodwill and IP

CTA 2009, Part 8.

```ad-guid
title: General rule
Receipts from transactions in intangible fixed assets will generally be treated as income receipts, and expenditure on intangible fixed assets will generally be deductible in calculating a company’s income profits (although not when the expenditure is part of the incorporation of a business).
```

### Disposal of Intangible Fixed Assets

Profits on the disposal of intangible fixed assets may be rolled-over into the acquisition of replacement intangible fixed assets (if qualifying conditions met), so corporation tax deferred. Otherwise, accounted for in income profit/loss calculation.

## Dividends

Dividends paid by a company are not deductible, but are treated as distributions of profit. Same for share buybacks–price over the allotment price treated in the same way as a dividend.

## Notification

Section 55 of the Finance Act 2004 requires a company to inform HMRC in writing of the  
beginning of its first accounting period (such notification to be within three months of the  
start of that period).

## Payment

- For most companies, the corporation tax due under self-assessment is payable within nine months and one day from the end of the relevant accounting period (TMA 1970, s 59D).
- The anticipated amount must be paid by that date, even if the final assessment may not have been agreed.
- Large companies may have to pay in 4 instalments.
- Very large companies must pay the tax in 4 instalments during the accounting period.

## VAT

A company that makes chargeable supplies in excess of £85,000 in any 12-month period will  
be required to register for value added tax (VAT).

## Inheritance Tax

A company cannot make a chargeable transfer for inheritance tax (IHT) purposes because a  
chargeable transfer is defined as being a transfer made by an individual. In certain circumstances, gifts made by companies do have IHT implications.

## Stamp Duty

When buying shares, stamp duty may be charged on the acquisition.

- Basic rule
	- Charged at 0.5% of the amount of consideration for the shares (rounded **up** to nearest £5).
- Exemptions and reliefs
	- No duty charged when consideration for shares is £1,000 or less
	- Transfers in a "recognised growth market" (e.g., AIM).
	- Provided certain conditions are met, stamp duty or stamp duty land tax will not be charged on transfers of assets between companies in a qualifying group.

s 42 Finance Act: stamp duty relief for companies transferring between companies within the same Group Company.
