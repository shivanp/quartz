# Corporation Tax

```toc
```

## Introduction

Companies resident in the UK are charged corporation tax–companies headquartered in UK or those with their essential functions in the UK. For a company, both income and capital are charged to corporation tax. But still need to work them out separately.

Subject to GAAR, introduced by Finance Act 2013.

## Calculation

1. Calculate income profits
	- Includes rent, interest and trading income
2. Calculate chargeable gains
	- Identify chargeable disposal
	- Calculate gain (NB Indexation)
		- Aim of indexation is to remove the effect of inflation from the gain, so only the gain is taxed.
		- HMRC publishes indexation tables.
	- Apply reliefs
	- Aggregate gains
3. Calculate total profits and apply reliefs against total profits
4. Calculate tax–19%.

## Trading Income

Recall that trading income = chargeable receipts less deductible expenditure less capital allowances.  

### Chargeable Receipts

Usually money received for the sale of goods and services.

### Deductible Expenditure

Tax legislation stipulates what is and is not deductible expenditure, so does not include e.g., bad debts, as in business accounts.

```ad-example
title: Examples of deductible expenditure for companies
1. Directors'/ employees' salaries or fees and benefits in kind. 
	1. So long as not excessive
	2. If paid for personal reasons and not wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade, then it will not be deductible. 
2. Contributions to an approved pension scheme for directors/ employees
3. Payment to director/ employee for termination of employment
	1. When made as compensation for loss of office/ employment, deductible expense
	2. When made in return for a non-compete undertaking, deductible under specifi provisions
4. Interest payments on borrowings
	1. Generally deductible under loan relationships rules, though there are limits on the amount of interest payments which can be deducted by listed companies. 
```

### Capital Allowances

Including:

- Writing down allowances
- Annual investment allowance
- Balancing charges/ allowances
- Temporary super-deduction
- Special first year allowance.

### Trading Losses

Company can carry forward losses under CTA 2010, s 45

## Chargeable Gains

### 1. Identify Chargeable Disposal

A chargeable disposal by a company can arise on a disposal of chargeable assets by way of either sale or gift. Chargeable assets for corporation tax purposes are defined broadly as for capital gains tax.

If a disposal forms part of the company's income stream, it will normally form part of the company's income profits rather than its chargeable gains (TCGA 1992, s 37). Special rules for intellectual property and goodwill.

#### Plant and Machinery

If capital allowances are available in relation to expenditure incurred on plant and machinery, the plant/ machinery will not benefit from the usual capital gains exemption for 'wasting assets'. In practice, unlikely to increase in value, so chargeable capital gain will not arise.

### 2. Calculate the gain/ Loss

| Deduction                        | = Total                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|                                  | Proceeds of disposal             |
| Less costs of disposal           | Net proceeds of disposal         |
| Less other allowable expenditure | Gain (before indexation) or Loss |
| Less indexation allowance        | Gain (after indexation)                                 |

If a company sells an asset at an undervalue:

- If the sale is just a bad bargain, the sale price will be used
- If there is a gift element, the market value of the asset will be used.
- If the sale is to a “connected person”, the sale will be deemed to take place at market value (TCGA 1992, s 286(5))
	- Company-person connection if a person (and their connected persons) control a company
	- Company-company connection if both controlled by a person (and their connected persons).

#### Indexation Allowance

Used when calculating the gain on an asset which has been owned between 31/03/1982 and date of disposal. Purpose: to remove inflationary gains from capital gains calculation, so a smaller gain is charged to tax.

The indexation allowance is calculated by multiplying the initial and subsequent expenditure by the indexation factor that covers the period from the date the expenditure was incurred (or 31 March 1982 if later) to the date of disposal of the asset (or 31 December 2017 if earlier).

- Allowance applied to initial and subsequent expenditure, but not to the costs of disposal.
- Where a company disposes of an asset which it owned on 31/03/82, gains before this date are excluded.
- Indexation can be used to reduce a gain to zero, but cannot precipitate loss.
- If there has been no overall deflation, no indexation allowance is available on expenditure.

### 3. Apply Reliefs

The range of reliefs available to companies is smaller than that available to individuals.

#### Roll-over Relief on Replacement of Qualifying Business Assets

ss 152-159 TCGA 1992.

Allows corporation tax due to the disposal of a 'qualifying asset' to be effectively postponed when the consideration obtained for the disposal is applied in acquiring another qualifying asset by way of replacement.

- Qualifying asset
	- Principle qualifying assets are land and buildings
	- Company must use the asset in its trade.
	- Company shares are not qualifying assets
	- Goodwill and IP subject to a separate roll-over relief.
	- Fixed plant and machinery is a qualifying asset but will rarely produce a gain, and roll-over relief on acquisition restricted if they are wasting assets.
	- Provided the asset disposed of and the asset acquired fall within the definition of qualifying assets, they do not need to be of the same type of asset.
- Time limits
	- Replacement asset must be acquired within 1 year before or 3 years after the disposal of the original asset.
- Application of relief
	- Any liability to corporation tax arising from the disposal can be postponed by rolling-over the gain (after indexation) on the disposal of the original asset into the acquisition cost of the replacement asset.

#### Exemption for Disposals of Substantial Shareholdings

A company's gains on disposal of shares it owns in another company are completely exempt from corporation tax if the conditions of the relief are met:

1. A disposing company must have owned $\geq 10\%$ of the ordinary shares in the other company for at least 12 months (continuously) within 6 years of the disposal
2. The company in which shares are held must have been a trading company throughout the 12 months of ownership.

Additional rules apply to disposals involving groups of companies.

## Total Profits and Reliefs

A company's income profits and any capital gains will be added together to produce total profits for the period. Certain reliefs are available:

- Qualifying donations to charity (Part 6 CTA 2010)
- Certain trading loss reliefs

| CTA 2010 | Relief                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| s 37     | Carry-across/carry-back relief |
| s 39     | Terminal carry-back relief     |
| s 45     | Carry-forward relief.          |

## Calculate Tax

If a company's accounting period is different from the corporation tax financial year (1 April to 31 March) and the rates of tax have changed from one financial year to the next, apply the different rates pro rata.

For the Financial Year 2022, there is a single main rate of 19%.

## Relief for Trading Loss

There are many CTA 2010 provisions allowing a company to deduct a trading loss from other profit to provide relief from corporation tax on these profits. If there are multiple options, the company can choose which to claim/ claim multiple.

### Carry-across/ Carry Back Relief

**ss 37-38 CTA 2010**: Trading loss can be carried across to be set against total profits for the same accounting period, and then the accounting period prior. There is a temporary extension to carry back 3 years–relief must be set against later years first, and carry-back to second and third years back is limited to £2 million.

Claim must be made within 2 years of the end of the accounting period of the loss.

### Terminal Carry-back Relief for Trading Losses

**s 39 CTA 2010**: when a company ceases to trade, a trading loss sustained in the final 12 months can be carried back and set against the company's total profits from any accounting period in the 3 years previously, taking later periods first.

Claim must be made within 2 years of the end of the accounting period of the loss.

### Carry-forward Relief for Trading Losses

ss 45-45B CTA 2010: can carry forward the trading loss for an accounting period and set it against subsequent profits.

- In the past, losses carried forward could only be set against profits of the same trade.
- However, trading losses arising in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2017 can be set against the company’s total profits in the **next** accounting period, provided that certain conditions are met.
- Can relieve £5 million deductions allowance + 50% of remaining total profits after deduction of allowance.
- Any losses not relieved can be carried forward indefinitely and set against future profits of the same trade.

| Section of CTA 2010                    | When will the loss have occurred? | Against what will the loss be set?                                                                  | Which accounting periods are relevant?                                                                                                                                            |
|:-------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s 37 (carry-across/ carry-back relief) | Any accounting period of trading  | The company's total profits (at Step 3)                                                             | The accounting period of the loss and, thereafter, the accounting period(s) falling in the previous 12 months                                                                     |
| s 39 (terminal carry-back relief)      | The final 12 months of trading    | The company's total profits (at Step 3)                                                             | The accounting period(s) of the loss and, thereafter, the accounting period(s) falling in the three years previous to the final 12 months of trading (taking later periods first) |
| s 45 (carry-forward relief)            | Any accounting period of trading  | The company's total profits (at Step 3). Subsequent profits of the same trade if conditions not met | Subsequent accounting periods until the loss is absorbed.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Corporation Tax on Goodwill and IP

CTA 2009, Part 8.

```ad-guid
title: General rule
Receipts from transactions in intangible fixed assets will generally be treated as income receipts, and expenditure on intangible fixed assets will generally be deductible in calculating a company’s income profits (although not when the expenditure is part of the incorporation of a business).
```

### Disposal of Intangible Fixed Assets

Profits on the disposal of intangible fixed assets may be rolled-over into the acquisition of replacement intangible fixed assets (if qualifying conditions met), so corporation tax deferred. Otherwise, accounted for in income profit/loss calculation.

## Dividends

Dividends paid by a company are not deductible, but are treated as distributions of profit. Same for share buybacks–price over the allotment price treated in the same way as a dividend.

## Notification

Section 55 of the Finance Act 2004 requires a company to inform HMRC in writing of the  
beginning of its first accounting period (such notification to be within three months of the  
start of that period).

## Payment

- For most companies, the corporation tax due under self-assessment is payable within nine months and one day from the end of the relevant accounting period (TMA 1970, s 59D).
- The anticipated amount must be paid by that date, even if the final assessment may not have been agreed.
- Large companies may have to pay in 4 instalments.
- Very large companies must pay the tax in 4 instalments during the accounting period.

## VAT

A company that makes chargeable supplies in excess of £85,000 in any 12-month period will  
be required to register for value added tax (VAT).

## Inheritance Tax

A company cannot make a chargeable transfer for inheritance tax (IHT) purposes because a  
chargeable transfer is defined as being a transfer made by an individual. In certain circumstances, gifts made by companies do have IHT implications.

## Stamp Duty

When buying shares, stamp duty may be charged on the acquisition.

- Basic rule
	- Charged at 0.5% of the amount of consideration for the shares (rounded **up** to nearest £5).
- Exemptions and reliefs
	- No duty charged when consideration for shares is £1,000 or less
	- Transfers in a "recognised growth market" (e.g., AIM).
	- Provided certain conditions are met, stamp duty or stamp duty land tax will not be charged on transfers of assets between companies in a qualifying group.

s42 Finance Act: stamp duty relief for companies transferring between companies within the same Group Company.
