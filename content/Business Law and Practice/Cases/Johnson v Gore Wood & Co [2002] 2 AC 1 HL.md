# Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1 HL

In this case the claimant was a majority shareholder in a company who sued a firm of solicitors for negligence on the ground that their negligence had caused him personal loss. Proceedings for negligence brought by the company had settled. The defendants argued that the claim was a claim for reflective loss and was an abuse of process. This case came before the House of Lords who analysed the situation in detail.
