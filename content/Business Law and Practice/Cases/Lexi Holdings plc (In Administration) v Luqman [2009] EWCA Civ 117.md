# Lexi Holdings plc (In Administration) v Luqman [2009] EWCA Civ 117

The court held that two sisters who were non-executive directors of a company were liable for failing to exercise active oversight of the company's affairs where their brother, who was managing director, had stolen almost Â£60 million that banks had lent the company for use in its business. The sisters were held to be negligent and jointly liable with their brother for the stolen money.
