# Pender v Lushington (1877) 6 Ch D 70

Where an individual member's rights have been infringed (here, the Chairman refused to recognise the shareholder's votes at a meeting), that member may bring a personal action to enforce those rights (here, to have his vote recorded) even where the conduct complained of may also constitute a wrong to the company itself.

**Facts:**

In the case of Pender v Lushington [1877], the companyâ€™s articles of association entitled every member to one vote for each 10, shares held, up to a maximum of 100 votes overall. To avoid this provision, the plaintiff transferred some of his shares to his nominees. However, at a general meeting, the chairman refused to count the votes of the nominees. As a result, the plaintiff commenced a representative action on behalf of himself and the other shareholders who had tried to vote with him.

**Issue:**

Whether the plaintiff was entitled to have his votes recorded at a general meeting?

**Held:**

The plaintiff succeeded. The court held that the plaintiff, as a member of the company, had a personal right to have his votes counted. Thus, the plaintiff had a personal right to exercise a vote at a general meeting. His vote was improperly rejected by the chairman of a general meeting.
