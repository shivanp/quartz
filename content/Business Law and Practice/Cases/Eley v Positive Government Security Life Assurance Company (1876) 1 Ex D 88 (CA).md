# Eley v Positive Government Security Life Assurance Company (1876) 1 Ex D 88 (CA)

## Facts

- Eley was a member who was also employed as the company’s solicitor.
- Article 118 of the company’s constitution stated “_Mr William Eley of 27 New Broad Street, City of London, shall be the solicitor to the company…_“.
- When the company ceased employing him as solicitor, Eley brought an action claiming that the the company constitution had been infringed.
- The Exchequer Division held the articles did not create any contract between Eley and the company.

## Held

- The Court of Appeal held that there was no infringement as Eley was not suing as a member.
- Eley had not been employed as a member and the termination of work as a solicitor did not affect Eley’s status as a member of the company.

The company's articles provided that E (who was also a shareholder) was to be the solicitor for the company and should not be removed from his office other than for misconduct. E brought a claim against the company for breach of contract for not employing him as its solicitor. The court held that the claim failed since E was seeking to enforce rights under the articles in his capacity as a solicitor (an outsider), which was not possible because he had no standing to do so. The articles can only be enforced by shareholders (insiders) in relation to shareholder specific rights.
