# Harris v Jones [2011] EWHC 1518

## Summary

Where a shareholder held another shareholder's share on trust, he had acted in breach of trust when allocating the shares of the company as his actions had the effect of diluting the beneficiary's interest in the company from 50 per cent to 0.1 per cent.

## Abstract

The petitioner (H) sought an order under the [Companies Act 2006 Pt 30](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D424A208B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b6881a62fcab4b9ab1dacff9e3c3d70a&contextData=(sc.Default)) that his shares in a company (Z) be bought by the respondent (J) at a price to be fixed.

Z had an authorised share capital of 1000 shares and H and J each had a 50 per cent interest, owning one share each. H subsequently transferred his share to J for J to hold on trust for him. H and J's relationship broke down and H threatened to put Z into administration. They then sought to sell the shareholding of Z and H prepared company accounts. A company (Y) interested in buying Z asked for H to restate the accounts but this was not done and no sale took place. Z faced cash flow problems and, in 2007, unknown to H, the remaining 998 shares were allocated which had the effect of diluting H's interest to 0.1 per cent and increasing J's to 40 per cent. H brought a petition alleging that the affairs of Z had been conducted in a way that was unfairly prejudicial to him. In 2008, J participated in a sale of all the shares in Z without the knowledge or consent of H.

H contended that J had acted in breach of his duty as trustee of the share when he participated in the arrangements in 2007 which led to the dilution of his shareholding in Z.

## Held

Judgment accordingly.

(1) The arrangements made in 2007 appeared to be uncommercial. Neither J nor Z made any effort to seek funding in some other way. Taking account of the uncommercial terms of the arrangements, and the fact that J did disproportionately well out of those arrangements, the only conclusion that could be drawn was that one of the principal drivers of the arrangements was to dilute H's 50 per cent stake to a negligible 0.1 per cent. J's participation was not compatible with his obligations as trustee of the share he had an obligation not to take unjustified steps to diminish the value of the share and his conduct was a clear breach of that obligation (see paras [125, 127-128](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) H had not established that J was in breach of trust in relation to the alleged failure to sell the shares in Z to Y (paras [133-134](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) H was entitled to an award of equitable compensation. The proceeds of the sale in 2008 would have been reduced to £220,000 after the payment of interest, financial charges and fees to a funder. The appropriate award was £110,000 and to avoid double recovery the payment by J of that amount would discharge his liability to pay the 0.1 per cent of the actual sale price (para.[139](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) Objectively considered the arrangements of 2007 were unfairly prejudicial to H and his petition under Pt.30 was well founded. However, the relief which the court ought to grant under [s.996](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D42BF508B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b6881a62fcab4b9ab1dacff9e3c3d70a&contextData=(sc.Default)) was not more extensive than the equitable compensation for the breach of trust and, as such, no further order was made (paras [154-156](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
