# Re a Company (No. 004415 of 1996) [1997] 1 BCLC 479

## Abstract

P inherited minority shareholdings in a group of construction companies. The majority shareholding had been held by the chairman and chief executive and on his death shares and directorships in the companies were distributed to his widow and children. P sought an order under the [Companies Act 1985 s.459 and s.461](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I954634D0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=26805f1abbf849e7ac1aa6f8e59385a6&contextData=(sc.Default)) that their shares be purchased by the family and companies, or alternatively that the companies be wound up under the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.125(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6CBE350E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=26805f1abbf849e7ac1aa6f8e59385a6&contextData=(sc.Default)) on the grounds that it would be just and equitable.

P's complaint was that the companies had been run for the benefit of the family, with unduly high directors' fees and low dividends combining to constitute conduct unfairly prejudicial to the interests of non director shareholders. The respondents sought to strike out the application to wind up the companies, alleging that it was actuated by P's desire to damage them, P having become the managing director of a rival company when he was refused a place on the board; they also applied to strike out paragraphs alleging breach of fiduciary duty and that they had acted out of malice and antipathy to P.

Held, allowing the applications, that

(1) the allegations regarding pay and dividends raised an arguable case of unfairly prejudicial conduct, but by far the most likely relief would be an order for the purchase of P's shares, which the respondents were financially well placed to do. The winding up order was one of last resort, and not a reasonable one to pursue if the buying out remedy was available. Further, the retention of the prayer for winding up was potentially damaging to the companies' trading prospects. It would therefore be struck out, and

(2) the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty would be struck out as the respondents owed duties to the companies not to the shareholders. The allegations of malice and antipathy would be struck out as, unlike the allegation of prejudicial conduct, they required positive supporting evidence as opposed to inference from the dividend and remuneration figures.
