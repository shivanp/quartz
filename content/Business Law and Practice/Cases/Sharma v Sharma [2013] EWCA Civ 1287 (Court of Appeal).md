# Sharma v Sharma [2013] EWCA Civ 1287 (Court of Appeal)

In this case, the sole director of a family company running dental practices acquired certain dental practices for her own benefit. She had fully disclosed all material facts to the shareholders at an informal meeting before doing so. One had authorised the acquisition and the other had silently acquiesced. The Court of Appeal held that the key question was whether the shareholders had full knowledge of the relevant facts. As they did here, it was held that they had authorised the action and therefore the director was not in breach of her duties under s 175. It was not necessary for the shareholders to appreciate that the proposed action would be characterised as a breach of duty.
