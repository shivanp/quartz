# Re Thomas Edward Brinsmead & Sons [1897] 1 Ch 406, CA

In this case, three men who were named Brinsmead were former employees of John Brinsmead & Sons, a renowned piano manufacturing company. They formed Thomas Brinsmead & Sons to make pianos, which they passed off as manufactured by John Brinsmead & Sons. The court held it to be just and equitable to wind up the company and return the money to the shareholders, since the purpose of the company was fraudulent.
