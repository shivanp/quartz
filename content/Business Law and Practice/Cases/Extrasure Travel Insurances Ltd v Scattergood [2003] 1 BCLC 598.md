# Extrasure Travel Insurances Ltd v Scattergood [2003] 1 BCLC 598

The judge stated that it is not necessary to prove that a director was dishonest or that he knew he was pursuing a collateral purpose, so in that sense the test is an objective one. The court must:

1. Identify the power whose exercise is in question;
2. Identify the proper purpose for which that power was delegated to the directors;
3. Identify the substantial purpose for which the power was in fact exercised; and
4. Decide whether that purpose was proper.

Note interaction with [[s 172 CA 2006]]: directors cannot act outside the proper purposes, even if they believe this to be in the best interests of the company.
