# Brooks v Armstrong [2015] EWHC 2289

Robin Hood themed business

The court in this case stressed that the burden of proof is on the directors to establish that they took every step to minimise loss to the creditors once they were aware that there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding insolvent liquidation. It was noted that the meaning of “every step” will depend on the facts in each case, but the following factors should be kept under review by directors:

> “Ensuring accounting records are kept up to date with a budget and cash flow forecast; preparing a business review and a plan dealing with future trading including steps that can be taken (for example cost-cutting) to minimise loss; keeping creditors informed and reaching agreements to deal with debt and supply where possible; regularly monitoring the trading and financial position together with the business plan both informally and at board meetings; asking if loss is being minimised; ensuring adequate capitalisation; obtaining professional advice (legal and financial); and considering alternative insolvency remedies.”

## Summary

Once it had been established that a company director knew or ought to have known that there was no reasonable prospect that the company could avoid insolvent liquidation, it was for him to show that he had taken every step to minimise the potential loss to creditors so as to avoid liability to contribute to the company's assets under the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.214](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID7108D71E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=78ddc5a601ff4829a8783f86a870421a&contextData=(sc.Default)). The court considered how to assess a director's knowledge and the relevance of company accounts, and the approach to the exercise of discretion to order the director to pay compensation.

## Abstract

The applicant joint liquidators applied for orders that the respondent directors (D1 and D2) contribute to the assets of an insolvent company and pay compensation for breach of duty.

The company had run a themed tourist attraction. The liquidators claimed that the directors had wrongfully traded in the knowledge that there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding insolvent liquidation following certain events: the year-end accounts for 2005 and 2006; the receipt of professional advice in October 2006 about a large VAT liability, in respect of which the directors had sought a review; the year-end accounts for January 2007, which showed a loss and did not include the VAT liability or an increase in rent expected from a pending rent review; a letter from Revenue and Customs in May 2007 stating that the VAT liability had been confirmed on review. The company entered liquidation on 6 February 2009. The issues were

(i) the burden of proof in respect of wrongful trading under the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.214](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID7108D71E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=78ddc5a601ff4829a8783f86a870421a&contextData=(sc.Default));  
(ii) whether D1 should be judged by a higher standard than a "reasonable director" given his experience;  
(iii) the interpretation of company financial statements for the purpose of knowledge;  
(iv) whether the directors had wrongfully traded;  
(v) whether the directors had taken every step with a view to minimising the potential loss to creditors so as to establish a defence under [s.214(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID7108D71E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=78ddc5a601ff4829a8783f86a870421a&contextData=(sc.Default));  
(vi) the calculation of compensation.

## Held

Application granted.

(1) Contrary to the construction in Sealy & Milan, Annotated Guide to the Insolvency Legislation, 2015 edn (London: Sweet & Maxwell), once it had been established that a director knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation, the onus was on the director to establish that he had taken every step to minimise the potential loss, _[Idessa (UK) Ltd (In Liquidation), Re [2011] EWHC 804 (Ch), [2012] B.C.C. 315, [2011] 3 WLUK 972](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFC58077075DB11E09DE5E226A161972F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=78ddc5a601ff4829a8783f86a870421a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The liquidators had to prove knowledge at some time before the start of the winding-up, rather than at a particular date. A starting date did not always have to be specified and their case would not necessarily fail if a specific date was not made out, but the director had to know the case to be met (see paras [6-7, 12, 14](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) Although D1 had greater experience as a director, it was in a different retail field and did not lead to a higher standard in the instant case (para.[173](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) Although the company's financial statements were not available until the next financial year, the directors ought to have used the information they contained to assess the extent to which the company was commercially solvent. Depreciation and a debt write-off should have been excluded, as they did not help an understanding of whether the company was profitable (paras [183-185](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) There was no duty not to trade while insolvent, or at a loss; a company could legitimately trade at a loss because the directors anticipated profit to the benefit of the existing creditors. Section 214 did not require proof of insolvency at the date of knowledge. Knowledge should not be approached with hindsight, and the fact that a decision proved to be wrong did not necessarily amount to a failure to act as a reasonable director. In the instant case, following the VAT advice, the directors had been entitled to investigate what to do rather than be criticised for acting too precipitously. However, acting reasonably and with the general knowledge, skill and experience reasonably expected, the directors knew or ought to have known by January 2007 that the company could not afford, and therefore make, a time-to-pay arrangement with Revenue and Customs and that the company had no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation (paras [180, 242-243, 251, 253](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(5) Applying the reasonably diligent director test in s.214(4), the adverse consequences of liquidation when balanced against the potential benefits of trading meant that the directors had taken the right course by continuing to trade from February 2007. However, circumstances changed with receipt of the May 2007 letter. Further, it was or ought to have been foreseeable that the company would be unable to make the next rent payment. Whether the directors had minimised the loss had to be judged by reference to the body of creditors as a whole. The directors had ensured that the trade creditors were paid, but not the VAT and rent liabilities, so that the liabilities to the creditors as a class were increasing; the requirement to take every step needed the directors to aim to minimise loss for all creditors (paras [262, 264, 266, 276](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(6) The discretion to order compensation under s.214 was unfettered. It was designed to recoup loss, not to be penal. To establish the maximum liability the loss would normally be represented by the amount that the assets had been depleted and/or the debts to the creditors increased. There had to be more than a "but for" nexus between the wrongful trading and the loss. Compensation based on the difference between a hypothetical liquidation on 3 May 2007 and the actual liquidation should take account of the facts that continued trading had: not caused the VAT liability but had increased interest and penalties; increased the debt to the landlord, but it could prove for all future rent subject to a discount; benefitted trade creditors and reduced the bank overdraft; not been for dishonest reasons (paras [287, 291-292, 294, 297, 302-306](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
