# Shuttleworth v Cox Bros Ltd [1927] 2 KB 9

**Facts:**

In the present case, the claimant and four other persons served as permanent directors of the company, holding the office for life. However, they could be disqualified by any one of the events specified in Art 22 of the company’s articles. These events were bankruptcy, insanity, conviction, failure to hold the necessary qualification shares, and being absent from meetings of the board for more than six months without leave.

Between 1924 and 1925 the claimant failed to account for money on 22 occasions. As a result, the articles of association were altered by adding another disqualifying event, namely, a request in writing by all the other directors. The claimant challenged the alteration of the articles and also claimed that his removal occurred in breach of contract.

**Issue:**

Whether alteration of the company’s articles of association and the resulting dismissal of the claimant were valid actions?

**Held:**

The Court of Appeal concluded that there was no evidence proving that the other directors acted in a bad faith in removing the claimant from the position of permanent director. The dismissal was based on the fact that there were irregularities the accounts between him and the company. The amendments in the company’s articles of association benefited the company as a whole. Thus, in these circumstances, the Court of Appeal upheld the validity of the company’s action.
