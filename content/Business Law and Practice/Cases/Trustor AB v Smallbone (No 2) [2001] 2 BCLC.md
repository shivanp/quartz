# Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 2 BCLC

S was the former managing director of T and had transferred various sums of money (approximately Â£20m) to a company he owned and controlled.

T applied to the court to pierce the corporate veil and treat receipt by the second company as receipt by S on the grounds that the company had been a sham created to facilitate the transfer of money in breach of duty, the company had been involved in the improper acts and that the interests of justice demanded this result.

The court found here that the company was indeed a sham and the device through which the impropriety was conducted and therefore, because of this improper motive, the court could lift the veil and find S liable.
