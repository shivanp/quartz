# Bairstow v Queens Moat Houses plc [2001] EWCA Civ 712

In this case the directors, acting on the basis of the company's 1991 accounts that incorrectly showed inflated profits, unlawfully paid dividends exceeding the company's distributable reserves. The Court of Appeal ordered the directors to repay the full amount of the dividends (over Â£78 million), and not only the amount in excess of the amount of dividend that could have lawfully been paid, since they were held to have deliberately and dishonestly paid the unlawful dividends.
