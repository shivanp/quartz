# Barron v Potter [1914] 1 Ch 895

This case established that the shareholders of the company in a general meeting may act in place of the directors where there is no board of directors competent or able to do so. Here the two directors of the company were not on speaking terms, so that effective board meetings could not be held. B (one of the directors) called a general meeting at which the shareholders attempted to appoint additional directors. P (the other director) objected that the power to appoint directors was stated under the company's articles to belong to the directors alone. The court held that in view of the deadlock, the power to appoint directors reverted to the shareholders and so the appointments were valid.
