# Welton v Saffery [1897] AC 299

Lord Davey said: ‘Of course, individual shareholders may deal with their own interests by contract in such way as they may think fit. But such contracts, whether made by all or some only of the shareholders, would create personal obligations, or an exceptio personalis against themselves only, and would not become a regulation of the company, or be binding on the transferees of the parties to it, or upon new or non-assenting shareholders.’

The Court held that it is quite true that the Articles constitute a contract between each member and the company and there is no contract in terms of between the individual members of the company but the Articles do not any the less, regulate their rights inter se, such rights can only be enforced by or against a member through the company or through the liquidators representing the company but no member has between himself and other members any right beyond that which the contract of the company gives.
