# Re Duomatic Ltd [1969] 2 Ch 365

In this case the liquidator of Duomatic claimed repayment of remuneration from one of the companyâ€™s directors, Mr Elvins, on the ground that the payments were not formally authorised by the company in general meeting. The court allowed the decision to stand despite the fact that it was not made at the general meeting, as it clearly had the backing of all shareholders.
