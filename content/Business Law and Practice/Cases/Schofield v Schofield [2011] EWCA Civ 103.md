# Schofield v Schofield [2011] EWCA Civ 103

Neil Schofield (representing the corporate holder of 99.9% of the shares in the company) unsuccessfully argued that he and Lee (his son and the owner of the remaining share) had agreed, informally, to treat as valid and effective a meeting which was called without regard to the notice requirements of s 307, and at which (amongst other matters) Lee was dismissed as director and Neil was appointed sole director. The court found that there was no unqualified agreement by Lee to the validity of the meeting or the decisions made.
