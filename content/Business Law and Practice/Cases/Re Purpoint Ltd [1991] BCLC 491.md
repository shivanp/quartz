# Re Purpoint Ltd [1991] BCLC 491

## Abstract

The company started trading in February 1986. By December 1986 it was unable to pay its trade debts as they fell due and it ceased trading in November 1987, by which time R director had found a job with a firm for which the company had carried out work. The company went into liquidation in May 1988 with a substantial deficit for creditors and most of its assets would be swallowed up by the Inland Revenue's preferential claim for arrears of PAYE. The liquidator applied under ss.212 and 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in respect of a car bought by the company in April 1987 on hire purchase which was not needed for the company's purposes, sums withdrawn in cash by R and transactions between the company and the firm which subsequently employed him.

Held, ordering R to pay sums of GBP 12,666 and GBP 53,572 to the liquidator, that the purchase of the car was not intended for the company's business and, coming at a time when the company was in a parlous state, was a breach of duty. That sum, together with the amounts withdrawn in cash by R, should be recouped. Where transactions between the company and the firm had resulted in a profit for the firm at the company's expense, those sums should also be recouped. R should have realised that the company could not avoid insolvent liquidation and that he would be liable to contribute to the company's assets in an amount equal to the loss caused by the continuation of trading after the end of 1986.
