# British America Nickel Corpn Ltd v Oâ€™Brien [1927] AC 369 (PC)

A company issued mortgage bonds secured by a trust deed, which gave power to a majority of the bondholders, consisting of not less than three-fourths in value, to sanction any modification of the rights of the bondholders.

A scheme for reconstruction of the company provided for the mortgage bonds being exchanged for income bonds subject to an issue of first income bonds; also that a committee, one only of whom was to be appointed by the mortgage bondholders, should have power to modify the scheme without confirmation by the bondholders. The scheme was sanctioned by the majority of the bondholders requisite under the trust deed.

The required majority would not have been obtained but for the vote of the holder of a large number of bonds, whose support of the scheme was obtained by the promise of a large block of ordinary stock, an arrangement which was not mentioned in the scheme:

Held the resolution was invalid, both because the bondholder in voting had not treated the interest of the whole class of bondholders as the dominant consideration, and because the scheme so far as it provided for a committee, was ultra vires.
