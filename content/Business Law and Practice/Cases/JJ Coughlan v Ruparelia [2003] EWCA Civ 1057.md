# JJ Coughlan v Ruparelia [2003] EWCA Civ 1057

The solicitor in question was found liable but his partners were not. The making of the agreement in question by the partner was not ‘an act for carrying on in the usual way business of the kind carried on by the firm’ under s 5, as would have been needed to make the other partners liable in contract. They were also not liable in the tort of deceit under s 10 as the scheme was not ‘in the ordinary course of the business of the firm’.
