# Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd [1946] 1 All ER 512 (Court of Appeal)

This company had issued ordinary shares of 10s and 2s each which ranked equally for all purposes, so that on a poll vote each member had one vote per share. G held the bulk of the 2s shares and controlled around 40% of the votes (so could block a special resolution). The holders of the 10s shares passed an ordinary resolution to subdivide the 10s shares into five 2s shares each, which altered the balance of the voting power in the company. G unsuccessfully claimed that the rights attaching to his 2s shares were varied by this. The court held that this was not the case: the rights attaching to his shares were unchanged, the only change was that more people could now enjoy the same rights.
