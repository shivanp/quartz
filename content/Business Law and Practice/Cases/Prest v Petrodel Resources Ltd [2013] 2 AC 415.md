# Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] 2 AC 415

#key-case

## Summary

Facts: This was a family law case concerning distribution of assets on a divorce.

The husband wholly owned and controlled a group of companies which owned a number of residential properties worth over £50 million, including the matrimonial home. The wife sought an order to transfer the properties to her on the basis that they were held by the companies on trust for her husband.

Lord Sumption gave the leading judgment in the Supreme Court. He started off by affirming the key principle in Salomon, that a company is a legal entity distinct from its shareholders and its property belongs to the company, not to the shareholders. He went on to discuss that the concept of piercing the veil refers to a true exception to the law in Salomon, where the court will look behind the separate legal personality of a company to hold its shareholders liable.

He found that there were historically two separate principles in which this was alleged:

1. Concealment principle

This doesn’t involve piercing the corporate veil. It describes cases where the corporate structure conceals the real actors, where the court will look behind the corporate structure to discover the real facts.

1. Evasion principle

The court may pierce the corporate veil if a person deliberately attempts to evade an existing legal obligation he is under by interposing a company which he controls. This was the case in **Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne (1933) Ch 935.**

Lord Sumption concluded that the corporate veil can only be pierced to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality where someone deliberately frustrates the enforcement of an alternative remedy by putting a company into place. He stated:

> "I conclude that there is a limited principle of English law which applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control. The court may then pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage that they would otherwise have obtained by the company's legal personality."

If there is another legal remedy then piercing corporate veil will not be necessary or available. In Prest there was no impropriety in the company holding the properties for tax purposes so piercing the corporate veil was not necessary (or desirable). However, he held that the properties were held by the company on trust for husband as beneficiary, so an order was made for the sale of the property and for the money to be given to the wife.

Benefit --> resulting trust. Someone benefits from the trust (beneficiary). In our case this was Mr Prest. So then it's his asset, so Ms Prest can take them. Companies in this case set up after the marriage. Found no impropriety in Mr Prest's actions.

## Notes From Judgement

Ancilliary relief following a divorce between Michael and Yasmin Prest. Seven companies which wife applied to have transferred to her through a court order as part of a court order, since they were held on trust for the husband.

Question: does the court have the power to order the transfer of these properties to the wife given they legally belong not to him but to his companies.

If they do belong to him, court can order ancillary relief under Part II of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.

Husband persistently trying to obstruct and deceive court. Court ordered that husband should give matrimonial home to wife, pay her £17.5 million together with £24,000/year and school fees for each of children. Judge ordered transfer of certain properties legally owned by companies to wife in partial satisfaction of this order.

Judge directed that PRL, Upstream and Vermont should be jointly and severally liable with the husband for 10% of those costs. Judge concluded that there was no general principle of law entitling him to reach the companies' assets by piercing the corporate veil. But judge concluded that in applications for financial relief ancillary to a divorce, wider jurisdiction to pierce the corporate veil available under s24 Matrimonial Causes Act.

Then in Court of Appeal, respondent companies challenged order against them. Has been practice of Family Division to treat assets of companies substantially owned by one party to the marriage as available for distribution under s24. But majority in Court of Appeal disagreed, and said this was improper unless:

1. corporate personality abused for purpose which was in some relevant respect improper
2. On the particular facts, could be shown that asset legally owned by the company held in trust for the husband.

But judge had rejected both of these possibilities on the facts, so ought not to have made the order.

In [[Salomon v A Salomon & Co ltd [1897] AC 22]] held that a company is a legal entity distinct from its shareholders, and this applied as much to a company wholly owned and controlled by one man as any other company. [[Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd [1925] AC 619]] – sole owner and controller of a company did not even have an insurable interest in property of the company. In [[Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd [1980] 1 WLR 627]] House of Lords held that documents of subsidiary not in the "power" of its parent company for the purposes of disclosure in litigation.

The 'fiction' of the separate personality and property of a company is a fiction which is the whole foundation of English company and insolvency law.

Accounts all muddied, assets probably transferred away already. Husband treated companies' cash balances and property as his own and drew on them as he saw fit. Was effectively his money box.

'Piercing the corporate veil' – effectively this means attributing acts or property of a company to those who control it, without disregarding its separate legal personality. For specific statutory purposes, companies can be associated (e.g. rules governing infringements of competition law by 'firms'). But this should not be termed piercing the corporate veil.

Most other legal systems recognise corporate legal personality but also acknowledging limits to logical implications. International Court of Justice derived principle permitting piercing of veil in cases of misuse, fraud, malfeasance or evasion of legal obligations. English law has no general doctrine like this. BUT in cases of fraud, everything unravels, legal incidents will not necessarily apply if dealings are not honest. In many contracts, fraud vitiates consent.

But there is a broader principle governing cases in which benefit of some apparently absolute legal principle has been obtained by dishonesty; there are limited circumstances in which law treats use of company as means of evading the law as dishonest.

Dive into history:  
All modern analyses of general principle start with obiter statement of Lord Keith of Kinkel in *Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional Council 1978 SC(HL) 90*, where he said

>"it is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil only where special circumstances exist indicating that it is a mere façade concealing the true facts."

Then [[Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433]], Slade LJ held that the corporate veil could only be disregarded in cases where used for a deliberately dishonest purpose. So cannot be disregarded merely because it considers that justice so requires.

Then in [[Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177]], submitted that the authorities justified piercing the corporate veil in three possibly overlapping cases:

1. Company a façade or sham
2. Company involved in some impropriety
3. Necessary in the interests of justice

Family Division pursued an independent line for policy reasons. There were dissenting voices around this – particularly discrepancy between Family Division and Chancery Division.

Court of Appeal: not necessary in order to pierce corporate veil that there should be no other remedy available against the wrongdoer.

Most of the cases in which the corporate veil was pierced could have been decided on other grounds. Consensus is that there are circumstances in which the court may pierce the corporate veil, consistent with general approach of English law to problems raised by use of legal concepts to defeat mandatory rules of law.

'Façade' or 'sham' is very weakly defined.

Concealment principle – just using legal structures to conceal ultimate owner of a company, nothing untoward about this

Evasion principle – trying to evade existing obligations through these structures.

Evasion principle was applied in [[Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch 935]]. Company was restrained in order to ensure that Horne was deprived of the benefit which he might otherwise have derived from the separate legal personality of the company. Court justified as granting an equitable remedy against it.

Similar case: [[Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832]]. But here Mr Lipman owned and controlled Alamed Ltd, so was in a position specifically to perform his obligation to the plaintiffs by exercising his powers over the company.

Broader principle: corporate veil may only be pierced to prevent the abuse of corporate legal personality, i.e. to deprive the company or its controller of the advantage they would otherwise have obtained by the company's separate legal personality.

Current case: husband has acted improperly in many ways:

- Misapplied the assets of his companies for his own benefit
	- Immoral but not illegal
- Made use of the opacity of corporate structure to deny being its owner
	- Husband giving false evidence
	- Concealment principle: court has uncovered the truth that has been concealed, nothing more to say
- Assets organised into companies long before the marriage broke up; so avoiding a settlement can't be his motivation. Judge: wealth protection and tax avoidance purposes.

> Courts exercising family jurisdiction do not occupy a desert island in which general legal concepts are suspended or mean something different.

Lower court just said of Matrimonial Causes Act 1973: purpose and intention is that companies' assets should be treated as part of the marital wealth. Not accepted by supreme court.

Yes the object is to achieve a proper division of the assets of the marriage, but does not follow that courts will stop at nothing in their pursuit of that end.

It is axiomatic that general words in a statute are not to be read in a way which

>"would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness".

The words are those of Lord Atkin in *Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd* [1940] AC 1014, 1031-1032, but the principle is very familiar and has been restated by the courts in many contexts and at every level.

> "In our legal system generally, the silence of one party in face of the other party's evidence may convert that evidence into proof in relation to matters which are, or are likely to be, within the knowledge of the silent party and about which that party could be expected to give evidence. Thus, depending on the circumstances, a prima facie case may become a strong or even an overwhelming case. But, if the silent party's failure to give evidence (or to give the necessary evidence) can be credibly explained, even if not entirely justified, the effect of his silence in favour of the other party may be either reduced or nullified."

No rent was paid to PRL for the family's occupation of the matrimonial home, indicating husband using PRL as vehicle to hold legal title of the trusts himself.

And then domino effect with the other companies and properties:

- Ownership of residential investment property in London appears to have nothing to do with the oil trading business in which PRL was then engaged
- At this stage a consistent patter can be discerned by which the husband causes properties to be acquired with funds provided by himself by companies under his control, nominally funded by PRL but in fact by himself.
- If some property was exception, break with past practice. No explanation - so conclusion that properties all beneficially owned by the husband.

Declared that the companies were all held on trust for the husband.

Added by Lord Neuberger:

Starting point is [[Salomon v A Salomon & Co ltd [1897] AC 22]]. Lord Templeman predicted that principle is an unyielding rock on which complicated arguments would become ship-wrecked.

In [[*re Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co, Ltd* [1970] ICJ 3]] the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is recognised, but that is in the context of a civil law system which includes the principle of abuse of rights. Unclear whether this is applicable in a common law system, without a specific legislative sanction.

Where a court is of the view that there is no other method of achieving justice, doctrine provides valuable means of doing so.

Decisions can be split into three cases:

1. Decisions in which it was assumed that the doctrine existed, but was rightly concluded that it did not apply on the facts
2. Decisions in which assumed that doctrine existed, and wrongly concluded to apply on the facts
3. Decisions in which assumed doctrine existed and was applied to facts, but results could have arrived at a different conventional legal basis.

Easterbrook and Fischel, *Limited Liability and the Corporation* (1985) 52 Univ Chicago L Rev 89, pithily observe that

> "'piercing' seems to happen freakishly. Like lightning, it is rare, severe, and unprincipled".

> [!note]
> So final principle is that the veil can be pierced where:
> 
> > "a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control"

Lady Hale:

In matrimony proceedings, court's role is an inquisitorial one. Parties have a duty not only to one another but also to the court to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts relevant to the exercise of the court's power.

She is not sure whether it is possible to classify all the cases in which the courts have been or should be prepared to disregard the separate legal personality of a company neatly into cases of either concealment or evasion: could just be examples of principle that individuals who operate limited companies should not be allowed to take unconscionable advantage of the people with whom they do business.

Lord Walker:

Piercing the corporate veil is not a doctrine at all in the sense of a coherent principle or rule of law, just a label used indiscriminately to describe the disparate occasions on which rule of law produces apparent exceptions to the principle of separate juristic personality of a body corporate.
