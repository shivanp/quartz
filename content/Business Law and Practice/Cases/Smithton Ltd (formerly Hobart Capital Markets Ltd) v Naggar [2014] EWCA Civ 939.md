# Smithton Ltd (formerly Hobart Capital Markets Ltd) v Naggar [2014] EWCA Civ 939

## Summary

The court gave guidance on the tests for whether a person was a de facto or shadow director, in a case where a company sought an indemnity for its losses from a director of its holding company.

## Abstract

The appellant brokerage company, formerly Hobart (H), appealed against a decision ([2013] EWHC 1961 (Ch), [2014] 1 B.C.L.C. 602) that the respondent (N), who was a director of H's holding company (D), was not a de facto and shadow director of H and that certain transactions had not fallen within the Companies Act 2006 s.190 such that N was required to indemnify H for losses of some Â£4 million.

H was a joint venture brokerage company and under the joint venture agreement it had three directors and three appointees from D, but N was not one of them. As part of its work, H undertook contracts for difference (CFD). N decided that certain shares were undervalued and H began writing CFDs for them, some of which were placed with clients N recommended. In order to hedge the CFDs, H purchased the physical shares and the shares fell in value. D collapsed and H sought to recoup its losses by seeking an indemnity from N.

H submitted that the judge had erred  
(1) in failing to determine H's corporate governance, since H's de jure directors had made no significant decisions without N's agreement;  
(2) in rejecting H's argument that the Companies Act 2006 s.190 was infringed when H entered into arrangements with N in connection with CFDs for clients who were N's connected persons for the purposes of that section.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) Whether a person was a de facto or shadow director was a question of fact and degree. Although there was no one definitive test for a de facto director, it was relevant to note whether he was part of the corporate governance system of the company and whether he assumed the status and function of a director to make himself responsible as if he were a director.

Although the concepts were different, there was some overlap between a shadow director and de facto director. A person might be a de facto director even if there was no invalid appointment if he had assumed responsibility to act as a director, and the court would have to determine in what capacity the director was acting. The court would normally have to determine the corporate governance structure of the company to decide whether his acts were directorial in nature. The court was required to look at what the director actually did and not his job title. ==Whether he acted as a director was to be determined objectively and irrespective of his motivation or belief, so that he would not avoid liability if he showed that in good faith he thought he was not acting as a director.== The court had not only to assess the cumulative effect of his activities but also the acts in their context, as a single act could lead to liability in an exceptional case.

Relevant factors included  
(i) whether the company considered him to be a director and held him out as such;  
(ii) whether third parties considered that he was a director.

The fact that a person was asked about directorial decisions, or for his approval, did not in general make him a director because he was not making a decision. Acts outside the period when he was said to have been a de facto director might indicate whether he had been so in the relevant period., Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Holland [2010] UKSC 51, [2010] 1 W.L.R. 2793, [2010] 11 WLUK 650 followed and Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Jones [1999] B.C.C. 336, [1998] 2 WLUK 97 applied (see paras 33-45 of judgment). Although the judge had not focused on the critical issue of the determination of H's corporate governance, N had never disputed that he had performed directorial acts. His defence had been that he had acted in a different capacity from that of a director of H and the judge had been entitled not to seek to meet a defence which had not been run (paras 61-62).

The capacity in which N had acted depended on an assessment of the evidence, and the judge had made no error of principle. H's challenge was really no more than a disagreement with the judge's findings of fact, which she had been fully entitled to make (paras 76-77).

The fact that N had access to some of H's confidential documents did not mean that he was, or became, a de facto director rather than merely acting as chairman of D (paras 80-81). (2) If H's argument had succeeded, then the CFDs would have been voidable and N obliged to indemnify H for its loss.

Furthermore, if s.190 had applied, it would have done so because N was a director of D and not because he was a de facto or shadow director of H. Section 190 required an arrangement under which a director or a connected person acquired 'or is to acquire' an interest in shares. There was no basis for interpreting the words 'is to acquire' as 'may acquire'. The fact that conditional arrangements were permitted did not require that interpretation, since even a conditional arrangement still had to satisfy the words quoted. When the arrangement was made for the CFDs to be written there had been no certainty that on closing out, the CFD holder would opt to acquire the referenced shares, so the judge had been entitled to find that s.190 did not apply to them (paras 108-111).
