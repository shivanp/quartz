# FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC [2014] UKSC 45 [2015] AC 250

This case involved a claim by FHR against its agent Cedar Capital, who took a secret commission of 10 million EUROs from the seller when negotiating FHR's purchase of a hotel complex. The Supreme Court held that an agent who received a bribe or secret commission in breach of fiduciary duty held it on trust for his principal.
