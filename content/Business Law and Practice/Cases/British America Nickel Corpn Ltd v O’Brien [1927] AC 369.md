# British America Nickel Corpn Ltd v Oâ€™Brien [1927] AC 369

The Privy Council considered whether a minority of a class of secured debenture holders of the appellant corporation were bound by resolutions passed by the majority of that class, where the power was conferred on the majority by the terms of a trust deed. It was held that the minority was not bound because the majority had not been motivated by what was most in the interests of the class, but by their own interests.
