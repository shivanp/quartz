# Sugarman v CJS Investments LLP [2014] EWCA Civ 1239

The Court of Appeal held that the literal interpretation of an article which gave each member of a housing management company one vote regardless of the number of shares held (which correlated to the number of flats leased) had to be applied, even though the effect of this was that a member with one flat had the same voting power as another member with 66 flats.
