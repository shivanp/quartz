# Re T & D Industries Ltd [2000] 1 LWR 646

Neuberger J set out the approach that the court should take towards the administration process.

In this case, the joint administrators of two connected companies applied for a direction under s 14(3) IA 1986 that no direction of the court was necessary before they could dispose of assets belonging to the companies, even though the proposed sale had not been disclosed to the creditors. The court noted that the intention was that administration proceedings should be a cheaper and more informal alternative to liquidation, and therefore the administrators did not require the court's leave.

Neuberger J held that although an administrator needs time to obtain the necessary information, this should be done as quickly as possible and administrators should call a meeting of creditors as soon as reasonably feasible. Commercial decisions are for the administrator and not the court, and an application for directions should only be made where there is a point of principle in issue or a dispute as to the appropriate course of action to be taken. Where an administrator needs to make an urgent decision, they should consult the creditors to the extent possible.
