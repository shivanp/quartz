# Franbar Holdings v Patel [2008] EWHC 1534

A disagreement arose about the way in which the company was managed and the operation of a shareholders' agreement. The claimant was a shareholder in the company who brought a claim against the company and the directors for breach of the shareholders' agreement, a petition for unfair prejudice and a derivative claim against the directors. The court refused permission to continue the derivative claim under the discretionary factors, considering that a notional director would not attach importance to the claim because the matters complained of were also covered by the actions for breach of the shareholders' agreement and the petition for unfair prejudice under s 994.
