# Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177

Directors of one company fraudulently diverted substantial sums to another company owned by one of them. The defrauded company sought return of the funds, from the company and from the second director on the basis that the corporate veil should be lifted by treating the receipt by the company as his.  

Held: Not every impropriety would lead to such a conclusion, but here the company was a device or facade used for a fraud, and the court treated the receipt by the company as receipt by the defendant. Sir Andrew Morritt V-C identified three suggested categories of cases in which it may be appropriate to pierce the corporate veil, including (1) cases in which the company was shown to be a facade or a sham, and (2) cases where the company was involved in some impropriety, and (3) where it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice and no unconnected third party is involved.  
Sir Andrew Morritt VC said:

>‘Companies are often involved in improprieties. Indeed there was some suggestion to that effect in Salomon v A Salomon and Co Ltd [1897] AC 22. But it would make undue inroads into the principle of Salomon’s case if an impropriety not linked to the use of the company structure to avoid or conceal liability for that impropriety was enough.’  

> ‘the court is entitled to ‘pierce the corporate veil’ and recognise the receipt of the company as that of the individual(s) in control of it if the company was used as a device or facade to conceal the true facts thereby avoiding or concealing any liability of those individual(s).’
