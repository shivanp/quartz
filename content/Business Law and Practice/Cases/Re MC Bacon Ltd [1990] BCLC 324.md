# Re MC Bacon Ltd [1990] BCLC 324

The company granted fixed and floating charges to its bank to secure an existing overdraft, as a condition of the bank not calling in the overdraft, at a time when it was insolvent. It was held that this was not a transaction at an undervalue because it had not diminished the value of the company's assets. In relation to the claim that this was a preference, the court said it is not necessary to prove an intention to prefer (which is objective), but a desire to prefer (which is subjective).

On the facts, the security could not be challenged as a preference because the directors, in granting the security, had not been influenced by a desire to prefer the bank, but only by the desire to continue trading and to avoid the calling in of the company’s overdraft (i.e. the security was granted as a result of genuine commercial pressure exerted by the lender and the presence of such pressure negated any desire on the debtor’s part to prefer the lender).
