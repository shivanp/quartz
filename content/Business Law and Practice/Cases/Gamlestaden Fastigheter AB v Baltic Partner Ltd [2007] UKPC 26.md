# Gamlestaden Fastigheter AB v Baltic Partner Ltd [2007] UKPC 26

In this case a member had provided a loan to the company and the issue was whether the member's petition should be struck out in circumstances where the company was insolvent and the relief sought (payment of compensation by the directors to the company) would confer no financial benefit on this member in his capacity as a member. The Privy Council held that “interests” may extend to cover those of a member who is a creditor as in this case where, in the circumstances, the distinction becomes artificial.

## Summary

Where the affairs of a company had been conducted in a manner that was unfairly prejudicial to a shareholder who had lent it money, he was not precluded from relief that would only benefit him as a creditor but not as a shareholder.

## Abstract

The appellant (G) appealed against the striking out of its application under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 Art.141 alleging that the affairs of the first respondent company (B) had been conducted in a manner that was unfairly prejudicial to the interests of some of the members.

G, which held 22 per cent of B's shares and had lent it money, had criticised the way in which the second, third and fourth respondent directors (F) had conducted B's affairs and sought an order under Art.143 that F should pay damages to B for breaches of the duty they owed it as directors. However, B was insolvent and would remain so even if the order were made. Therefore, the remedy that G sought would confer no financial benefit on it as a shareholder, only as a creditor. The Jersey court held that since an Art.141 application was a remedy for shareholders not creditors, G's application should be struck out as an abuse of process.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) An Art.141 application required a company's affairs to be or have been conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the applicant, which had to be a member of the company. Since the instant appeal arose out of G's Art.141 application being struck out, it was necessary to proceed on the assumption that the facts alleged by G were true; and since G was a member of B, both conditions for an Art.141 application were met.

(2) The court, if satisfied that the Art.141 application was well-founded, was empowered by Art.143 to make such order as it thought fit in respect of the matters complained of. Accordingly, in an unfair prejudice application, an order could be made for payment of damages to a company whose affairs had allegedly been conducted in an unfairly prejudicial manner, _Chime Corp Ltd, Re unreported_ applied.

(3) G had provided B with loans, and if F's mismanagement of B had led to loss, it was artificial to require that the qualifying loss for Art.141 purposes had to be loss that had reduced the value of G's equity capital rather than the recoverability of its loan capital, _[R&H Electric Ltd v Haden Bill Electrical Ltd [1995] B.C.C. 958, [1995] 5 WLUK 370](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I82544A60E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=29ee53311aeb43cc888ef333708b0908&contextData=(sc.Default))_ approved. It was not necessary in an Art.141 application to show that the relief had to be of some benefit to the applicant shareholder in his capacity as shareholder. The applicant would have locus standi as long as the relief would be of real value to him in facilitating recovery of some part of his investment.
