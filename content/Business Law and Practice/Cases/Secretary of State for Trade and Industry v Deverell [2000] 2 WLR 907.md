# Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Deverell [2000] 2 WLR 907

It was held that, in order to establish that a person is a shadow director of a company:

1. It is not necessary to show that the person gives directions or instructions on every matter on which the directors act, but it must be shown that the person has a real influence in the company’s corporate affairs;
2. Whether any particular communication should be classed as a direction or instruction is for the court to determine objectively;
3. Advice (provided it is not professional advice) may be a direction or instruction;
4. It is not necessary to show that the directors adopted a subservient role or surrendered their discretion;
5. Despite the use of the term ‘shadow director’ it is not necessary to characterise the person as ‘lurking in the shadows’: it is possible for a person to be a shadow director quite openly.
