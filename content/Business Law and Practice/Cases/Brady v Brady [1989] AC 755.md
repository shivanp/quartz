# Brady v Brady [1989] AC 755

This case involved the division of a company's business between its two shareholders, Jack (J) and Bob (B), who were brothers who had fallen out. It was decided that J would take the haulage business and B the soft drinks business, but because the haulage business was worth more than the soft drinks business, assets had to be transferred between the businesses. This was done by the company transferring assets to a new company controlled by B. This was held to be financial assistance, but the court had to consider whether the financial assistance was an incidental part of a larger purpose of the company which was to remove the deadlock between J and B which had threatened to result in the liquidation of the business.

The House of Lords held that the exception did **not** apply since the essence of the reorganisation was for J to acquire B Ltd's shares, therefore the acquisition of these shares could not be said to be “incidental” to the reorganisation.
