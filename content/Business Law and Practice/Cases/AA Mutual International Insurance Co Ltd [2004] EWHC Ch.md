# AA Mutual International Insurance Co Ltd [2004] EWHC Ch

The applicant was an insurance company which sought an administration order. The court found that it was probable that the applicant would be unable to pay its debts as it had no income. The administration was also held to be reasonably likely to achieve better results for the creditors as a whole than winding up, therefore the application was granted.
