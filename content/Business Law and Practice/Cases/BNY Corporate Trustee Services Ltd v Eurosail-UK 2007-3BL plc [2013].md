# BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd v Eurosail-UK 2007-3BL plc [2013]

In this case, the Supreme Court considered the meaning of “unable to pay its debts” and particularly the distinction between the cash flow and balance sheet tests. The case arose out of the 2008 collapse of the Lehman Brothers group and concerned the acquisition by the group of a portfolio of mortgage loans funded by loan notes repayable in 2045. The court held that the cash-flow test must include a consideration of debts falling due in the reasonably near future. What this means will depend on all the circumstances, but especially on the nature of the company's business. However, once the court has moved beyond the reasonably near future, then the balance sheet test becomes the only sensible test. The burden of proof must be on the party asserting balance-sheet insolvency.
