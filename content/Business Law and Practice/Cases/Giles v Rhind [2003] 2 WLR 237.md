# Giles v Rhind [2003] 2 WLR 237

In this case, the company was insolvent due to a former director’s breach of directors' duties not to compete or misuse confidential information. These duties were also express terms in a shareholders’ agreement, to which the defendant and claimant were parties. The company had initiated an action against the former director, but the administrative receivers discontinued it when the defendant director applied for a security of costs order. In effect, the defendant had, by his breach of duty, rendered the company incapable of seeking legal redress against him. The claimant sought to recover losses to the value of his shareholding, loss of remuneration and loss of the value of loan stock.

The Court of Appeal held that the claimant could pursue his claim for breach of the shareholders' agreement, including his losses in respect of the value of his shareholding. The claims for loss of remuneration and losses of capital and interest in respect of loans made by him to the company did not, in any case, fall within reflective losses. A substantial sum was awarded by way of damages. The court placed emphasis on the fact that the defendant’s own wrongdoing had, in effect, disabled the company from suing him for damages.
