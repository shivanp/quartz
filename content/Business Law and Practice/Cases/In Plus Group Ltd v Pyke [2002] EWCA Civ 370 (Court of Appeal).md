# In Plus Group Ltd v Pyke [2002] EWCA Civ 370 (Court of Appeal)

In Plus Group Ltd (IPGL) was controlled by Pyke and Plank, who were the only directors and shareholders. Pyke suffered a stroke and the business relationship deteriorated such that he was excluded entirely from the management of the company and no longer received a salary. He therefore started a new company and entered into a contract with one of IPGL's clients, Constructive. The claimants argued this was a breach of fiduciary duty and sought an account of profits.

The Court of Appeal found that there was no breach of fiduciary duty here. Brooke LJ stated:

>“Although he had invested a very large sum of money in the first and second claimants on interest free accounts, he was not being permitted to withdraw any of it. At the same time, he was being denied any remuneration from the companies. When he entered into business with Constructive in the autumn of 1997 he was not using any of the claimants' property for the purpose of that business. Nor was he making use of any confidential information which had come to him as a director of any of the companies. In these circumstances, I consider… that Mr Pyke committed no breach of fiduciary duty in trading with Constructive.”
