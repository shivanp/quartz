# Stimpson v Southern Landlords Association [2009] EWHC 1556 (ChD)

## Summary

A hypothetical director, in accordance with [Companies Act 2006 s.172](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5BF3F8308B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c640ddcc00414e669f64df04a71a7e29&contextData=(sc.Search)), would not, having regard to material considerations contained in [s.263(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5C1BA4718B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c640ddcc00414e669f64df04a71a7e29&contextData=(sc.Search)) and other legitimate factors, seek to continue a derivative action against a number of defendants.

## Abstract

The applicant former president (S) of the first respondent non-profit organisation (O) applied for permission to continue a derivative action against the second, third, fourth and fifth respondent former directors of O and the sixth respondent non-profit organisation (N).

S had been instrumental in the setting-up and running of O, an organisation dedicated to providing various tenant related services for its members who paid annual subscriptions. By vote at one of O's general meetings, a resolution was passed giving the executive committee the power to instigate merger proceedings with similar organisations. S was reluctant to allow O to merge with any other organisation. In order to prevent O's executive committee from proceeding to institute the resolution, he, and another committee member, absented themselves from all committee meetings with the effect that the committee became inquorate. The fifth respondent was, at that time, elected to the committee. Thereafter, the second to fifth respondents executed an agreement with N, a larger and more powerful organisation, to facilitate the merger of O. Subsequently, S brought a derivative action against the second through fifth respondents for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and a claim against N in respect of alleged knowing receipt of O's assets. S argued that O was worth £5.3 million.

S submitted that the merger agreement had been signed on behalf of O without authority. S argued that the fifth respondent had been illegitimately elected to O's executive board at a time when the committee lacked quoracy to make such an election and had continued, thereafter, to act in breach of their fiduciary obligations codified in the [Companies Act 2006](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I67088A508B0211DBB4C6A18EEE1C8BDD/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c640ddcc00414e669f64df04a71a7e29&contextData=(sc.Search)).

## Held

Application refused.

In order to resolve the dispute it was necessary to consider whether a hypothetical director would, in accordance with [s.172](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5BF3F8308B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c640ddcc00414e669f64df04a71a7e29&contextData=(sc.Search)), seek to continue the claim. Matters that fell to be considered by such a director were contained in [s.263(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5C1BA4718B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c640ddcc00414e669f64df04a71a7e29&contextData=(sc.Search)) but that provision did not contain an exhaustive list of matters which fell to be considered. Only one claim was realistically arguable, namely that the respondent directors had proceeded with the merger in the knowledge that it was not properly authorised given the lack of quoracy.

The other claims, such as alleged breaches of s.172, s.175, s.176 were not realistically arguable. O, being a non-trading not-for-profit organisation could not be considered to have a value of £5.3 million as claimed by S. It could not be considered to have a value greater than its assets of £200,000 and the value of the assets transferred to N were less than that as it had also acquired its liabilities. Moreover, the level of costs incurred in continuing the claim against the second to sixth respondents would far outweigh any benefit to O or its members who had, in the past, intimated a desire to grant the executive committee power to instigate merger proceedings.

Having regard to s.263(3) and other relevant considerations, a hypothetical director would not seek to continue the claims. On that basis, the court refused permission to allow the applicant to continue the action (see paras [35,39,40](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")(a),40(b) of judgment).
