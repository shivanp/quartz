# Royal Mail Estates Ltd v Teesdale [2015] EWHC 1890

The court applied Denning LJ's reasoning in the **Phonogram v Lane** case. The contract concerned the sale of property in London and contained a clause which stated: 'The benefit of this contract is personal to the buyer'. The judge did not consider this wording to exclude the effect of s 51, as it did not expressly indicate an intention to exclude the effect of s 51 and at the time the contract was formed, neither of the parties was aware that the company had not been incorporated.
