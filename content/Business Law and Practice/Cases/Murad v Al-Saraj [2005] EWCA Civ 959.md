# Murad v Al-Saraj [2005] EWCA Civ 959

This case concerned the purchase of a hotel by Murad (M) and Al-Saraj (S) through a company formed for that purpose. The parties had agreed the contributions they would each make to the purchase price but S had fraudulently misrepresented that his contribution would be made in cash, whereas it was actually made by setting aside obligations owed by the vendor to S. The hotel was subsequently sold for a profit of £2 million and M brought proceedings against S for breach of duty.

The court held that S should account to M for the entire profit made from the transaction. S argued that only a part of the profit should be payable as if the arrangement had been disclosed to M, they would have agreed to go ahead with the purchase but with a higher profit share, therefore S should only be liable for the loss incurred by M as a result of the non-disclosure of the set-off arrangement.

The court stated:

>“Liability does not depend on fraud or lack of good faith. The existence of a fraudulent intent will, however, be relevant to the question of the allowances to be made on the taking of the account… For policy reasons, on the taking of an account, the court lays the burden on the defaulting fiduciary to show that the profit is not one for which he should account…”.

It was held that the appropriate remedy here was that all the profits made by the fraudulent representations should be repayable.
