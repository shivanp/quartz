# Cullen Investments Ltd v Brown [2015] EWHC 473 (Ch)

In this case the court granted permission to continue the claim to trial. The claimant alleged that a director had exploited a corporate opportunity for his own benefit. The shareholder had assumed all the financial risks of the litigation and the court rejected the argument that no director acting in accordance with their duty under s 172 would have supported the claim.
