# McCallum-Toppin [2019] EWHC 46 (Ch)

AMT Coffee was a family company set up by three brothers (Angus, Alistair and Allan) and their father Alexander McCallum Toppin and ran kiosk coffee shops principally at mainline stations.  The shares were held equally, a quarter each.  As an early entrant into the coffee market, the business expanded quickly and was profitable and successful.  Sadly, Angus died in 2006 aged just 45.  His shares were held by his estate, the executors of which were initially his wife Lucy and his brother Allan, who later retired as executor, and was replaced firstly by a solicitor and latterly by a family friend.

Allan and Alistair between them ran the company and proceeded over the intervening years to:

- Scupper a sale that was due to take place in 2007 with offers of between £15.5m and £30m from various third parties;
- Run up huge interest free directors loan accounts, which although were initially repaid with bonuses, were latterly not repaid causing a reduction in the Company’s profits without the compensation of interest and corresponding tax implications;
- Pay themselves (and to a lesser extent their mother Anna, who had inherited their father’s shares upon his death in 2001) excessive wages, without proper director and shareholder approval; and
- Fail to pay dividends, or even consider paying dividends, depriving the Estate of income to which it would otherwise be entitled.

Under s 996 CA, the majority were ordered to buy the minority’s shares at a “fair value” at an undiscounted valuation.
