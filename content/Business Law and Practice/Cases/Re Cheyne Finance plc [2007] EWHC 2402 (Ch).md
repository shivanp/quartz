# Re Cheyne Finance plc [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)

## Summary

The test of commercial or cash flow insolvency to be found in the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.123(1)(e)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6C309B0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f1d935d4881040b0a045190f6cc759d2&contextData=(sc.Search)) did not exclude consideration of prospective or future debts.

## Abstract

The applicant receivers (R) of a company (C) asked the court to determine on assumed facts issues of construction of the definition of "Insolvency Event" in an agreement.

The court had determined that pending the happening of an insolvency event, R should apply moneys coming into their hands on a "pay as you go" basis rather than giving precedence to making full provision for payment of all senior debt. On the assumed facts C could not pay its senior debts in full as they fell due merely by letting its investments run to maturity. R had a substantial investment portfolio in their hands, but the high level of asset sales required to continue with the "pay as you go" approach would involve C selling assets for discounted prices which would in turn deplete its balance sheet and render it unable to pay some of its late-maturing senior obligations. R asked the court to determine whether, on the assumed facts, C was unable or about to become unable to pay its debts as they fell due to senior creditors within the meaning of "Insolvency Event" and other questions. "Insolvency Event" meant a determination by R that C was, or was about to become, unable to pay its debts as they fell due to senior creditors and any other persons whose claims against C were required to be paid in priority thereto, as contemplated by the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.123(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6C309B0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f1d935d4881040b0a045190f6cc759d2&contextData=(sc.Search)).

Senior creditors with short maturity dates for whom continuation of the pay as you go regime was preferable to an early declaration of an Insolvency Event submitted that on the question whether C was unable to pay its debts as they fell due only those senior debts which were presently due were to be considered, and on the question whether C was about to become so unable, those senior debts which were about to become due were to be considered in addition, and all senior debts with medium or longer term maturities were excluded. Other senior and subordinated creditors submitted that, both in principle and because all C's senior debts had fixed maturity dates and amounts and because C was in run-off rather than a going concern, all senior debts had to be considered whenever falling due.

## Held

Judgment accordingly.

(1) The court rejected the submission that the deliberate omission of reference to [s.123(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6C309B0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f1d935d4881040b0a045190f6cc759d2&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the 1986 Act showed that the parties agreed that R had to apply the English test of commercial or cash flow insolvency to be found in [s.123(1)(e)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6C309B0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f1d935d4881040b0a045190f6cc759d2&contextData=(sc.Search)) and that the language of s.123(1)(e) omitted, and therefore required to be ignored, all contingent and prospective liabilities. For many years before 1985 the English courts had addressed the question of insolvency without any rigid distinction between commercial and cash flow insolvency on the one hand and balance sheet insolvency on the other. The submission that commercial insolvency could not be established by reference to future debts could not then have succeeded, _[Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99549, [1986] 10 WLUK 281](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I658DE6908A6511DB9602E173DEF14245/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f1d935d4881040b0a045190f6cc759d2&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered.

Commercial and balance sheet insolvency were split apart in s.123 and in the place of the mandatory requirement to take account of contingent and prospective liabilities there had been added in s.123(1)(e) the phrase "as they fall due" after "debts". The requirement to consider contingent and prospective liabilities appeared in s.123(2). There was no English authority on the question whether those changes prevented reference to prospective, i.e. future, debts under s.123(1)(e). There was a wealth of Australian authority indicating that a cash flow or commercial insolvency test permitted references to debts which would fall due in the future. When separating out balance sheet insolvency from commercial insolvency in s.123 the effect of the alterations was to replace one futurity requirement with another, by reason of the addition of the words "as they fall due" in s.123(1)(e). Further the presumed common intention to be derived from the parties’ choice to define inability to pay debts by reference to s.123(1) rather than s.123(2) was simply that they wished C’s solvency to be adjudicated on a commercial rather than balance sheet basis, and nothing more than that, since the definition incorporated the whole of s.123(1), not just s.123(1)(e). The definition of Insolvency Event did permit R to have regard to C’s ability to pay senior debts falling due in the future.

(2) The standard of proof for the inability to pay debts was the balance of probabilities.

(3) On the assumed facts C was unable to pay its debts as they fell due.
