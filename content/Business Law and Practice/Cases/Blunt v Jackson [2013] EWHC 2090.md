# Blunt v Jackson [2013] EWHC 2090

## Summary

The dismissal of a director of a company constituted exclusion from the company that was unfair and prejudicial to his interests as a shareholder under the [Companies Act 2006 s.994](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D4223108B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f8e3b94b5ece41a8a229c7ff74f41646&contextData=(sc.Default)).

## Abstract

The court was required to determine two preliminary issues in relation to an unfair prejudice petition presented by the petitioner (B).

B, and the first respondent (X), had incorporated a company (F) in April 2010 to import weight loss machines and were its initial directors. From the outset, B was employed by F on a modest salary. In November 2011, B was dismissed and removed as a director of F, which ceased trading about May 2012. During F's trading, there had been an almost complete disregard of the statutory and formal requirements for the operation of a limited company. B's primary complaint in presenting the substantive unfair prejudice petition was that he had been excluded from the company from the time of his dismissal, though he had entered into a partnership with X on F's incorporation on the understanding that each were to be equal shareholders. X denied that B had been a shareholder at all, despite an annual return splitting F's shareholding equally between B, X and the second respondent (Y), and a subsequent annual return stating that all of F's shares had been transferred to X. In support of his shareholding claim, B relied on tax returns in which he had declared dividends from the shares he held in F. The issues were whether

(i) B had been a shareholder in F;  
(ii) the grounds complained of in the unfair prejudice petition were grounds for an order under the [Companies Act 2006 s.994](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D4223108B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f8e3b94b5ece41a8a229c7ff74f41646&contextData=(sc.Default)).

## Held

Preliminary issues determined.

(1) B and X had agreed on the basis of a partnership to establish F, a company in which each would hold an equal shareholding; that was the basis on which B had worked for F on a very modest salary. Moreover, F had paid dividends to B, which was only explicable on the basis that B was a shareholder; the fact that he had never been entered into the shareholder register was explicable on the basis that none existed. Moreover, the fact that a declaration of dividends had never been made as required under F's articles was of no real significance, given that X had manifestly neglected to keep any proper documentation of F's affairs. Accordingly, there had been an agreement with B that he would become a member of F as required under s.112, and B was an equal shareholder in F with X (see paras [31-34, 48](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) Exclusion of a shareholder from a company in the form of a partnership was a well established ground for finding unfair prejudice, _[O'Neill v Phillips [1999] 1 W.L.R. 1092, [1999] 5 WLUK 312](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I11D8DA20E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f8e3b94b5ece41a8a229c7ff74f41646&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. In the instant case, there was no doubt that from B's removal as a director in November 2011 he had been excluded; the attempt to make Y a shareholder and dilute B's shareholding, and the subsequent transfer of all of B's shareholding to X were also examples of that exclusion. Given the basis on which F had been established, that exclusion was clearly unfair and prejudicial to B's interests as a shareholder under s.994 (para.[47](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
