# Currencies Direct Ltd v Ellis [2003] BCLC 482, CA

In this case the defendant was a shareholder and director of the claimant company, who received sums in cash or payment by way of expenses incurred by him. After he was excluded from the management of the company, the company sought to recover £253,000 from him on the basis that this money had been loaned to the director. The judge found that the company could only recover £43,117 as the rest of the money had been remuneration rather than a loan. It was held that remuneration is consideration for work done or to be done and may take different forms, not only the direct payment of a regular wage.
