# Citco Banking Corporation NV v Pusser's Ltd [2007] UKPC 13

This was a Privy Council case involving a Hong Kong company, which at a general meeting amended the share rights in its articles and created a new class of shares, which had the effect of giving the Chairman of the company control. The Privy Council dismissed the claim by Citco that these amendments were invalid. They stated that the test was whether reasonable shareholders could have considered that the amendment was for the benefit of the company. On the facts of this case it was found that it would have been reasonable for shareholders to have accepted in good faith the arguments put forward by the Chairman as to why the amendment would be in the interests of the company.
