# Bridge v Daley [2015] EWHC 2121 (Ch)

Here the court refused permission to continue the derivative claim. The judge accepted that the claimant shareholder was acting in good faith but since most of the allegations were unsubstantiated and the overwhelming majority of shareholders and the independent board members did not support the claim, permission was refused. The judge concluded that the complaint would be better brought as a petition for unfair prejudice under s 994.
