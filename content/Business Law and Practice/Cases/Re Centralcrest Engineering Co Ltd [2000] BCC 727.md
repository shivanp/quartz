# Re Centralcrest Engineering Co Ltd [2000] BCC 727

The Inland Revenue brought proceedings against a liquidator under s 212. The liquidator had allowed the company to continue to trade for 27 months after it had gone into compulsory liquidation, resulting in £73,230 being owed to the IR. The court held that there were two elements to the misfeasance: firstly, allowing the company to trade without the sanction of the court or liquidation committee and secondly allowing the company to trade when it was apparent that the assets should have been realised. The liquidator was held liable to compensate the company for losses of £120,826 incurred during the trading period.
