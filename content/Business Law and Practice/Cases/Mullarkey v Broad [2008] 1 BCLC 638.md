# Mullarkey v Broad [2008] 1 BCLC 638

## Summary

Where the misfeasance of a company director was concerned, it was not for the director to justify his conduct but for the complainant to prove his case.

## Abstract

The claimants (M, G and S) alleged fraudulent misfeasance by the defendant company director (B).

M, the first claimant, and B had been directors of a company (X) which fulfilled a treasury management function to the third defendant holding company (S). The financial affairs of S's company group and X were reorganised, and M subsequently resigned his directorship of X, leaving B as a director. Thereafter, the S group collapsed, X was wound up and S was dissolved. Misfeasance was alleged arising out of the transfer by S of a property without payment to M or B, and the payment of sums by S to B and his son or companies connected to them. It was a feature of the case that the events complained of had taken place 15 years previously, and that financial and other records were incomplete and in some cases inconsistent with each other, and also that witnesses could not recall the details of what the figures had represented after such a lapse of time.

The claimants contended that B had used his powers as a director of X in a way that he had known to be contrary to X's interests, or that he had been recklessly indifferent to whether the use of his powers had been in X's interests or not, and that he had been conscious of, or had deliberately turned a blind eye to, the elements of the use of his powers that had made them contrary to X's interests. It was submitted that where the misfeasance of a company director was concerned, it was for the director to justify his conduct rather than for the complainant to prove his case, _[Barton Manufacturing Co Ltd, Re [1998] B.C.C. 827, [1997] 10 WLUK 229](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3762A6F0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=169a92615b5c4d0eaa5836397c106011&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. B denied misfeasance and contended that the claimants had no right to bring the claim as they were not creditors of the company concerned. M and G asserted that they brought their claim as assignees of the rights of two of S's subsidiary companies.

## Held

Judgment for defendant.

(1) On the evidence, and with hesitation in view of the long lapse of time and the incompleteness of the records, it was more probable than not that at the date when X had gone into liquidation it had owed S all or part of a debt shown as due at that time. S had, therefore, been a creditor of X and was entitled to bring the instant claim. As M and G were assignees of S's claims, they were entitled to pursue the claims also.

(2) In a case where complaints related to things that had happened for the most part over 15 years ago it was all the more important that allegations of dishonesty be clearly and distinctly pleaded. The burden of proof lay on claimants in establishing the fraud that they alleged, and where the misfeasance of a company director was concerned, it was not for the director to justify his conduct rather than the complainant to prove his case. Barton did not have the effect of reversing the burden of proof in all misfeasance cases, still less where the allegations had been of fraud, Barton considered.

(3) On the state of the evidence, the allegations of fraudulent breach of trust or duty on the part of B had to fail.
