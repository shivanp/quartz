# Morris v Kanssen [1946] AC 459

The House considered the effect of provisions relating to the acts of directors in the 1929 Act. Lord Simonds said:

> ‘There is, as it appears to me, a vital distinction between  
> (a) an appointment in which there is a defect or, in other words, a defective appointment, and  
> (b) no appointment at all.
>
> In the first case it is implied that some act is done which purports to be an appointment but is by reason of some defect inadequate for the purpose; in the second case there is not a defect, there is no act at all. The section does not say that the acts of a person acting as director shall be valid notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered that he was not appointed a director.
>
> Even if it did, it might well be contended that at least a purported appointment was postulated. But it does not do so, and it would, I think, be doing violence to plain language to construe the section as covering a case in which there has been no genuine attempt to appoint at all. These observations apply equally where the term of office of a director has expired, but he nevertheless continues to act as a director, and where the office has been from the outset usurped without the colour of authority.’
