# Re German Date Coffee Co [1882] 20 Ch D 169

In this case, the company was registered with the object of acquiring a German patent for manufacturing a coffee substitute from dates. The German patent was not granted, although a Swedish patent was. The company built up a prosperous trade in the coffee substitute, but despite this the Court of Appeal made an order for the company to be wound up on the basis that the whole substratum of the company was gone. The company had been established not for the general purpose of making coffee from dates but to work a particular patent, and as that patent did not exist, the company could be wound up.
