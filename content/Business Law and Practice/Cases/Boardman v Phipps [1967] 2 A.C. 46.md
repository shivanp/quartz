# Boardman v Phipps [1967] 2 A.C. 46

This case is the landmark English trusts law case on the conflicts rule. The principle that the House of Lords set down is relevant as to the meaning of conflict:

>“Whether a reasonable man looking at the relevant facts and circumstances would think that there is a real and sensible possibility of conflict”.

**Facts:**

In Boardman v Phipps [1967] 2 A.C 46, Boardman was solicitor for a trust: the ‘Phipps family trust’. He was not a trustee, but was in a fiduciary capacity as the advisor to the Phipps family trust. Boardman was aware of a large amount of commercial information about the company. This information was confidential.

With a great amount of work on Boardman’s part, the company generated a large profit both for the trust and for Boardman personally. However, one of the beneficiaries learned that Boardman had taken personal profit. As a result, they sought to sue Boardman to recover the profit for the benefit of the trust.

**Issue:**

Was Boardman entitled to keep the profits of his own shares, or was he required to hold the profits on constructive trust for the beneficiaries of the trust?

**Held:**

Boardman should have held the profits on constructive trust for the beneficiaries of the existing trust because he was acting as a fiduciary in his capacity as a solicitor advising the trustees. As a fiduciary, he was not entitled to permit a conflict between his personal interests and his fiduciary duties.

Unusually, the defendants in this case were not the trustees of the trust but the solicitor to the trustees (Boardman) and one of the beneficiaries (Tom Phipps (‘TP’)).

The trust fund included 27% of the shares in a poorly performing company. TP and Boardman had taken an interest in the running of the company and had attempted unsuccessfully to have TP appointed as a director. Instead, they decided personally to acquire the rest of the shares in the company. TP obtained the consent of two out of the three trustees, who confirmed that the trust was not able to take advantage of this opportunity. (The third trustee was the testator’s widow, who was in poor health and incapable of consenting.) Boardman continued to act as solicitor to the trust, obtaining information about the company in that capacity. He wrote to the beneficiaries, requesting permission to take a personal interest in the negotiations relating to the company, and believed that he had obtained that permission.

Having purchased the remaining shareholding, TP and Boardman reorganised the company and significantly increased its profitability. This resulted in a profit to the trust (as it still had its shareholding in the company) but also a personal profit for TP and Boardman, because they also held company shares. It was clear that the actions of the defendants had been motivated by a desire to increase the value of the shares for the benefit of the trust, but this did not change the fact that they had obtained a personal benefit too. Both were held to have breached the no-profit rule and were required to give up their profits (although Boardman was awarded a liberal allowance for the work that he had done, effectively remunerating him for his efforts).

The case is significant for a number of reasons. The first is that it demonstrates that fiduciary relationships are a matter of fact, and can arise in any circumstances which have given rise to a relationship of trust and confidence.

Boardman was clearly in a fiduciary position by virtue of his role as a solicitor, but TP was one of the beneficiaries. However, by taking on this burden of attempting to improve the fortunes of the company, he had put himself into a position whereby he was acting as an agent of the trust and therefore owed fiduciary duties to the other beneficiaries.

Neither TP nor Boardman had successfully obtained consent to make a personal profit. TP had sought the authorisation of the trustees, but they cannot provide consent. It must come from the beneficiaries.

Although Boardman had attempted to obtain the consent of the beneficiaries (and genuinely believed he had done so) it was found on the facts that he had not provided them with sufficient information about what he was doing in order for them to be able to give fully informed consent. He therefore also had no defence.

The House of Lords decided (3:2) that there had been a breach of fiduciary duty in this case (with the minority concluding that there was no real conflict on the facts because the defendants having acted at all times with the interests of the beneficiaries at heart).

Although the majority differed in their reasoning as to the nature of the profit, the case is clear authority for the proposition that a fiduciary will be liable for profit that they make by exploiting an opportunity that has come to them as a result of their fiduciary position, whether or not their principal would (or even could) have exploited that opportunity if the fiduciary had not done so.

Where persons are in the position of agents for trustees for the purpose of using the trust shareholding to extract knowledge of the affairs of a company, the knowledge so acquired is trust property, and they must account to the trust for any profit made out of it. Such persons may, however, be entitled to payment on a liberal scale for their work and skill.

A testator left his residuary estate on trust for his three sons and daughter. Part of the residue consisted of 8,000 shares in L, a private company with an issued share capital of 30,000 GBP 1 shares, and a considerable shareholding in a family company, of which B, a member of a firm of solicitors acting for the trust, and T.P., one of the testator's sons, were directors. In December 1955, an inquiry was received whether the trustees of the will, who were the daughter and an accountant, F, would sell the 8,000 shares in L. B was consulted and shown L's accounts for the previous year, which showed the shares to have an assets value of GBP 10 per share. B and T.P. were appointed proxies for the trustees of the will and attended L's annual general meeting "to represent the holding." At and after the meeting B obtained further details of the company's affairs and shortly afterwards he and T.P. decided to gain control of L. B informed the daughter of this by letter. Her reply gave her approval but indicated that she was not contemplating B and T. P. acting outside the trust. B and T. P. then wrote to the shareholders of L personally offering GBP 2 5s. per share, subsequently raised to GBP 3 per share, and as a result by July 1957 they had acquired 2,925 shares under that offer.

Then followed a period in which B, often describing himself as representing the trust holding, acquired much information about L. In March 1959, an agreement was entered into for the sale to T. P. and B of the director's 14,567 shares for GBP 4 10s. each. On the same day B wrote to the plaintiff, J. P., another son of the testator, who had hitherto known nothing of the negotiations, asking whether he had any objection to the proposed sale bearing in mind that the initial inquiry had been on behalf of the testator's estate, and there followed an interview at which the financial aspects were not fully presented to the plaintiff. In January 1960 shareholders were informed that part of L's business had been sold and a capital distribution of GBP 3 per share was announced; the plaintiff expressed approval. Later a further distribution of GBP 2 17s. 6d. took place after the sale of another part of the business. T. P. then offered the plaintiff GBP 2 per share in L, upon which the plaintiff consulted solicitors and brought an action claiming an account of the profits made by B and T. P. personally from the dealings in the shares of L.

Wilberforce J, having held that they were accountable for the profit attributable to the respondent's share in the trust fund ([1964] 1 W.L.R. 993), less their expenditure incurred to enable it to be realised and making a liberal allowance for their skill and work in producing it, and the Court of Appeal having dismissed an appeal by B and T.P. ([1965] Ch. 992), on further appeal, held (Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Upjohn dissenting)

(1) that they had placed themselves in a special position, of a fiduciary character, in relation to the negotiations with the directors relating to the trust shares, had thereby obtained an opportunity to make a profit out of the shares and were accordingly accountable for the profit made;

(2) that the appellants had acted openly, but mistakenly, in a manner highly beneficial to the trust and so were entitled to payment on a liberal scale for their work and skill. Appeal dismissed.
