# Clark Boyce v Mouat [1994] 1 AC 428

## Abstract

A solicitor may act for both parties in a transaction where their interests conflict provided that the informed consent of both is obtained. R's son wished to borrow a large sum in N.Z. dollars but was unable to offer further security in his house. His mother (R) offered her house as security but her son's usual solicitors declined to act in the transaction. The son then approached another firm, A, who agreed to act for both mother and son. R was advised to seek independent advice but declined. The legal consequences of the transaction were fully explained to R. Subsequently the son's business failed, and R was left with the liability of repaying the mortgage. She sued A essentially for acting for both parties when it was not appropriate. A won at first instance, the decision was reversed on appeal. A appealed to the Privy Council.

Held, allowing A's appeal, that there was no general rule of law that a solicitor should never act for both parties where their interests might conflict. A solicitor might so act provided the informed consent of both parties was obtained. Whether informed consent had been given depended on the facts of the case. On these facts A had carried out their duties properly and done all that was reasonably required (dictum in _[Boulting v Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians [1963] 2 Q.B. 606, [1962] 11 WLUK 127](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I76FA65F0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=96f26aa2a10e4cfb9cd651e513b73a88&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
