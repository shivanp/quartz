# Towers v Premier Waste Management Ltd [2012] BCC, 72

Mummery LJ:

>"A director of a company is appointed to direct its affairs. In doing so it is his duty to promote its success and to protect its interests. In accordance with equitable principles the special relationship with the company generated fiduciary duties on the part of a director. His fiduciary commitments to the company took the form of a duty of loyalty and a duty to avoid a conflict between his personal interests and his duty to the company."

In _Towers v Premier Waste Management Ltd_, the Court of Appeal held that a director, who had accepted a free, undisclosed and unapproved loan of equipment from a customer of the company, had breached his loyalty to the company and his duty to observe the no conflict principle, which embraced a duty not to make a secret profit for himself.
