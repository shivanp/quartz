# White v Bristol Aeroplane Co [1953] Ch 65 (Court of Appeal)

In this case the preference shareholders argued that a proposal to increase the share capital of the company by way of a bonus issue of shares to all the existing shareholders (both the ordinary and preference shareholders) affected the voting rights of their shares such that a class meeting should have been required. The Court of Appeal held that this was not the case â€“ the actual rights attaching to the preference shares were not varied by the addition of extra shares, even though the exercise of their rights was affected by the increase in shares.
