# Re Keenan Bros Ltd [1986] BCLC 242

(Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland) A debenture conferred a fixed charge on book debts. It specifically provided that withdrawals from the account to which the proceeds of the book debts had to be credited might only be made with the prior consent in writing of the Bank. This additional restriction on the ordinary operation of a current account made it certain that the charge was fixed or specific and not floating. One must look, not at the declared intention of the parties alone, but to the effect of the instruments whereby they purported to carry out that intention. Was the account one which allowed the company to continue to use the proceeds of the book debts as a source of its cash flow or was it one which, on the contrary, preserved the proceeds intact for the benefit of the bankâ€™s security? Was it, putting the point shortly, a blocked account?
