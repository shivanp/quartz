# Salomon v A Salomon & Co ltd [1897] AC 22

#key-case

## Facts

- Mr Salomon was a shoemaker in England.  His sons wanted to become his business partners so he converted his business into a limited company (**A Salomon & Co Ltd**).
- A Salomon & Co Ltd purchased Mr Salomon’s business for above market value.
- His wife and his five children became subscribers.  The two eldest sons became directors of the company.
- Mr Salomon was allocated 20,001 of the company’s 20,007 shares.
- The company gave Mr Salomon £10,000 in debentures and received an advance of £5,000 from Edmund Broderip, on security of the debentures.
- Salomon’s business eventually failed and it defaulted on its interest payments on the debentures (half held by Broderip). Broderip sued to enforce his security.
- The company went into liquidation. Broderip was repaid his £5,000. This left £1,055 company assets remaining.  Salomon claimed this amount under his retained debentures. This would leave nothing for unsecured creditors.
- The company’s liquidator argued that Salomon should be responsible for the company’s debts. Salomon sued for the £1,055.

## Issue

- Was the formation of A Salomon & Co Ltd a fraud intended to defeat creditors?

## Held

- After several sets of proceedings in lower courts, the appeal landed in the House of Lords.
- Court of Appeal had previously said that veil must be pierced.
- The _Companies Act 1862_ (UK) did not require shareholders to be independent of the majority shareholder.
- A Salomon & Co Ltd was legally constituted and it was not the role of judges to read  limitations into the statute in a manner that they considered preferable.

> “Either the limited company was a legal entity or it was not. If it was, the business belonged to it and not to Mr. Salomon… If it was not, there was no person and no thing to be an agent at all; and it is impossible to say at the same time that there is a company and there is not.”  
> -(Lord Halsbury LC at page 22)

## Significance

Clear that a company is a separate person, and not the agent or trustee of its controller. Can be validly used by individuals to carry out what in economic reality is the business of an individual.
