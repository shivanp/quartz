# Item Software (UK) Ltd v Fassihi [2004] EWCA Civ 1244

## Summary

The fundamental duty that a director owed as a fiduciary to act in good faith in the best interests of the company included a requirement to disclose his own misconduct. An employee whose employment terminated during a pay period was entitled under the Apportionment Act 1870 to apportioned salary for the period before termination irrespective of the cause of termination.

## Abstract

The appellant (F) appealed against a decision ([2003] EWHC 3116, [2003] B.C.C. 858) that he had been in breach of his fiduciary duty as a director. F had been the sales and marketing director, in addition to being an employee of the respondent software company (X), of which D was the only other director. X's main source of business was distributing software made by another company (A). X sought to renegotiate its terms with A, but at the same time, F entered into private talks with A with a view to setting up his own company. F encouraged D to improve X's position in the negotiations and A ultimately terminated the contract. F was summarily dismissed when his actions were discovered and X sought damages for breach of fiduciary duty. The judge below found for X, on the ground that F had been in breach by failing to disclose his own wrongdoing. F appealed, arguing that no such duty existed under common law. F further argued, that under the [Apportionment Act 1870 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I14C2CD20E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bb831bbff75b43bdaf8b73fdb0c481b2&contextData=(sc.Default)) , he was entitled to be paid the portion of salary due in respect of the part of the month he had worked before being dismissed.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that F was under a fiduciary duty to disclose his own wrongdoing. A director's duty to act in the best interests of the company was a broad and well established principle that was not restricted in its application. F could not possibly have believed that it was in X's best interests for him to withhold the information of his talks with A, therefore he had breached his fundamental duty. As a director, his position was different to that of being only an employee where such a duty was not imposed, _[Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd [1932] A.C. 161, [1931] 12 WLUK 30](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7346D3D1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bb831bbff75b43bdaf8b73fdb0c481b2&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.
