# Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832

The defendant had contracted to sell his land. He changed his mind, and formed a company of which he was owner and director, transferred the land to the company, and refused to complete. The plaintiff sought relief.  

Held: Specific performance is available against a contracting vendor who has it in his power to compel another person to convey the property in question. An order for [[Specific performance]] was made against both the director and the company. The company could not escape from or divest itself of its knowledge gained through the director.

The company was:

>‘A creature of [the controlling director], a device and a sham, a mask which he holds before his face in an attempt to avoid recognition by the eye of equity.’
