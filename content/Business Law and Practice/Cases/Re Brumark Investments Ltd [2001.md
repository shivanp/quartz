# Re Brumark Investments Ltd [2001

In this case a company attempted to create a fixed charge over its book debts. The court held that the proceeds of book debts received by the company were excluded from the fixed charge unless the bank had ordered payment into an account that the company could not operate freely, which was not the case. It was held that the key issue was who had control of the proceeds and the answer determined the type of charge. Here the company's freedom to collect and use the proceeds of the book debts as it wished without requiring the lender's consent was inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge. This was a Privy Council case, which means that it is persuasive but not binding.
