# Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc [2015] UKSC 71

The issue here concerned the power of directors to issue a disclosure notice calling for information about persons interested in its shares.

The articles of the company (article 42) allowed the directors to disenfranchise a shareholder (i.e. prevent the shareholders from participating in the company) for non-compliance. The case involved a 'corporate raid' on JKX which was an attempt to exploit a minority shareholding in the company to obtain effective voting control without paying a proper price for shares. The directors of JKX suspected the minority shareholder of mounting a corporate raid and therefore issued disclosure notices to the shareholders and subsequently stopped these shareholders from voting at the AGM. The shareholders challenged this exercise of power.

The Supreme Court held that the proper purposes rule did apply to the exercise of the power by JKX's board and it had been breached. Sumption LJ stated:

>â€œThere is in principle a clear line between protecting the company and its shareholders against the consequences of non-provision of the information and seeking to manipulate the fate of particular shareholders' resolutions or to alter the balance of forces at the company's general meetings. The latter are no part of the purpose of article 42. They are matters for the shareholders, not for the board."
