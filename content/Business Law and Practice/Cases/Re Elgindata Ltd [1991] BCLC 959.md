# Re Elgindata Ltd [1991] BCLC 959

The plaintiff obtained a patent which was then to be utilised through the company, of which the plaintiff had one third shares. He later complained that the majority shareholder had acted prejudicially.  

Held: Mismanagement could amount to prejudicial conduct of the business. There was no evidence of failure to consult but some evidence of misuse of assets. It would be wrong to leave the plaintiff with the shareholding, and an order was made for the purchase of the shares by the co-shareholder at a discount to reflect the minority status. Whether or not it would be fair to value as at the date of the order can depend on whether irregularities in the accounts have been corrected.
