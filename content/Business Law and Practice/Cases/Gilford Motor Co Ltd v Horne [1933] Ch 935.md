# Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch 935

The defendant was the plaintiff’s former managing director. He was bound by a restrictive covenant after he left them. To avoid the covenant, he formed a company and sought to transact his business through it.

At first instance, Farwell J had found that the company had been set up to enable the business to be carried on under his own control but without incurring liability for breach of the covenant. The reality was however that the company was being used as ‘the channel through which the defendant Horne was carrying on his business.’ In fact, he dismissed the claim on the ground that the restrictive covenant was void.  

Held: The ruse was ineffective, and an injunction was issued to prevent Horne and his company from breaching the covenant he had given. The company was (as Lord Hanworth MR put it) formed in order to mask the effective carrying on of a business by Mr Horne, the purpose being to enable him to carry on that business in breach of a covenant he had entered into. The shareholders and directors of the company were Mr Horne’s wife and one Howard, an employee of the company.  

Lord Hanworth MR said:

>‘I have not any doubt on the evidence I have had before me that the Defendant Company was the channel through which the Defendant Horne was carrying on his business. Of course, in law the Defendant Company is a separate entity from the Defendant Horne but I cannot help feeling quite convinced that at any rate one of the reasons for the creation of the company was the fear of Horne that he might commit breaches of covenant . . and that he might possibly avoid that liability if he did it through the Defendant company . . I am quite satisfied that this company was formed as a device, a stratagem, in order to mask the effective carrying on of the business of Horne. The purpose of it was to try to enable him under what is a cloak or a sham, to engage in business which, on consideration of the agreement which had been sent to him before the company was incorporated, was a business in respect of which he had a fear that plaintiffs might intervene and object.’
