# Re Sprintroom [2019] EWCA Civ 932

It was held that a breach of duty by a director who incorrectly claimed that the intellectual property to a piece of software vested with him personally, not the software development company, did not preclude his entitlement to a remedy as a (40%) shareholder under **s 994 CA 2006**.

The court found that the majority 60% shareholder unfairly prejudiced the minority 40% shareholder by:

- Exclusion from management. As a director, although the minority had breached s 172 and s 175 CA 2006, this was not sufficient to justify his exclusion as the dispute as to IP rights was conducted openly; whereas a more egregious breach in bad faith such as secret negotiation from competitors would justify his exclusion.
- Making an offer to buy the minorityâ€™s shares which did not reflect his 40% interest (so a balancing payment was ordered).
