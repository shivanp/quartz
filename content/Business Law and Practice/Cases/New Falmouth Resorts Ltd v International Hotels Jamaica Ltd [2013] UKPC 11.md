# New Falmouth Resorts Ltd v International Hotels Jamaica Ltd [2013] UKPC 11

 The agent had no actual or ostensible authority to enter into the transaction but the company ratified the transaction, which meant that it was no longer able to rely on the lack of authority of the agent. The court stated:

 >"the acts of an agent on behalf of the principal outside his actual authority may be adopted and ratified"

 

 and

 >"if there is ratification it has retrospective effect, ie it renders the transaction with the company binding on it from the time it was entered into by the agent."
