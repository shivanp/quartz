# Agnew v IRC [2001] 2 BCLC 188, PC

A charge had been given by a company over its book debts. The charge was expressed to create a fixed charge over debts uncollected when a receiver was appointed, so that on collection they became payable to the bank. Until the receiver was appointed, the charge claimed to be a floating charge, and subject to some limitations, could deal with them freely. The essence of a floating charge is that it is a charge, not on any particular asset, but on a fluctuating body of assets which remain under the control of the chargor. The ability to control the receipt of the asset, and thus take it out of the charge was inconsistent with a fixed charge.  

Lord Millett said:

> ‘Property and its proceeds are clearly different assets. On a sale of goods, the seller exchanges one asset for another.’
