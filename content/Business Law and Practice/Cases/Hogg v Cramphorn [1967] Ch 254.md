# Hogg v Cramphorn [1967] Ch 254

The directors of the defendant company issued 5,707 new shares with special voting rights to the trustees of a scheme set up for the benefit of the company's employees in order to avoid a takeover bid. This allotment of shares was held to be for the purpose of destroying the voting control of the majority shareholders, so was held to be void and an improper use of the directors' power to issue shares, although was capable of ratification by the shareholders in a general meeting.

The court held that the power to issue shares was subject to a fiduciary duty, and even though the directors acted honestly, their exercise was improper, so the share issue could be set aside.
