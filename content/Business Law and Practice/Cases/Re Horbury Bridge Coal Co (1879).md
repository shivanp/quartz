# Re Horbury Bridge Coal Co (1879)

Lord Jessell MR described the position at common law as regards the rights of members with different numbers of shares in the company, saying:

> “We first of all consider what may be termed the common law of the country as to voting at meetings. It is undoubted, and it was admitted by Sir Henry Jackson in his argument for the Respondents, that, according to such common law, votes at all meetings are taken by show of hands. Of course, it may not always be a satisfactory mode – persons attending in large numbers may be small shareholders and persons attending in small numbers may be large shareholders, and therefore in companies provision is made for taking a poll, and when a poll is taken the votes are to be counted according to the number of shares…”
