# Bhullar v Bhullar [2003] EWCA Civ 424 (Court of Appeal)

This case involved two brothers, Mohan and Sohan, who founded and controlled a family company, Bhullar Bros Ltd. Family relations broke down and negotiations to split the company assets between the families of M and S took place but were not successful. At this time, M told S and his sons at a board meeting they he did not wish any more properties to be purchased by the company.

Later, S's sons (I and J) learned that a property adjacent to one of the company's existing properties was for sale, and they purchased it in the name of Silvercrest, a company controlled by them. The M family issued a petition for unfair prejudice seeking relief on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty.

The Court of Appeal concluded that S's sons I and J were in breach of fiduciary duty in purchasing the property for their own benefit, despite the fact that they came upon the opportunity to purchase the property privately. Lord Parker stated:

>“Whether the company could or would have taken that opportunity had it been made aware of it, is not to the point: the existence of the opportunity was information which it was relevant for the company to know, and it follows that the appellants were under a duty to communicate it to the company.”

The 2003 case involved a breakdown in relations between two brothers (and their wives and children), the two groups being referred to by the Court of Appeal as “Mohan’s family” (the petitioners under an unfair prejudice petition) and “Sohan’s family” (the respondents). Mohan’s family won. In consequence, a property acquired by Inderjit Singh Bhullar and Jatinderjit Singh Bhullar (on the Sohan side of the family) through the vehicle of Silvercrest Trading Ltd (which the two brothers owned) was determined to be held on trust for Bhullar Bros Ltd.
