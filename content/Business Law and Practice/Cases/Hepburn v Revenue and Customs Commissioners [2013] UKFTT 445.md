# Hepburn v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2013] UKFTT 445

The appellant had agreed to provide consultancy services to a company though the medium of a limited company which at the time of the agreement had not yet been incorporated. The consultancy services were performed and the fees were paid to solicitors who held the monies on behalf of the limited company until it was incorporated. The question on appeal was whether the fees should be taxed as the appellant's personal income rather than the company's income. The court held that the 'subject to any agreement to the contrary' proviso applied here as there was never any intention on anyone's part that the appellant should become personally entitled to the fees.
