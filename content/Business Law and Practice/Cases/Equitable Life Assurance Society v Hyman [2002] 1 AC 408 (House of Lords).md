# Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman [2002] 1 AC 408 (House of Lords)

The company's articles gave the directors a wide discretionary power to pay bonuses on the members' life insurance policies. The directors had exercised this power to pay some policyholders a larger bonus than others, contrary to 'guarantees' which were given when some members took out their policies.

Lord Steyn held that the articles should be read as containing an implied term that the directors would not exercise their discretion 'in a manner which deprived the guarantees of any substantial value.'
