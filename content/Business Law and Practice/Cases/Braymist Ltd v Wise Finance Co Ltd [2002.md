# Braymist Ltd v Wise Finance Co Ltd [2002

This case involved a contract for the sale of land entered into by solicitors on behalf of a company yet to be incorporated. Subsequently the developers changed their minds and the solicitors sought to enforce the contract. The court held that the solicitors were entitled to do so.

The usual rules of contract will apply, so if for example a [[Misrepresentation]] about the identity of the party to the contract (the future company) induced the other party to enter into the contract to its detriment then the other party is entitled to rescind the contract.
