# Edwards v Halliwell [1950] 2 All ER 1064 CA

The rule in _Foss v Harbottle_ (1843) 2 Hare 461; 67 ER 189, as I understand it, comes to no more than this. First, the proper plaintiff in an action in respect of a wrong alleged to be done to a company or association of persons is prima facie the company or the association of persons itself.

Secondly, where the alleged wrong is a transaction which might be made binding on the company or association and on all its members by a simple majority of the members, no individual member of the company is allowed to maintain an action in respect of that matter for the simple reason that, if a mere majority of the members of the company or association is in favour of what had been done, then cadit quaestio. No wrong had been done to the company or association and there is nothing in respect of which anyone could sue.

If, on the other hand, a simple majority of members of the company or association is against what has been done, then there is no valid reason why the company or association itself should not sue. In my judgment, it is implicit in the rule that the matter relied on as constituting the cause of action should be a cause of action properly belonging to the general body of corporators or members of the company or association as opposed to a cause of action which some individual member can assert in his own right (Jenkins LJ).

Rule 19 of the rules of the defendant trade union provided: ‘The regular contributions of employed members shall be as per tables … and no alteration to same shall be made until a ballot vote of the members has been taken and a two-thirds majority obtained.’ In December 1943, a delegate meeting of the union, without taking any ballot, passed a resolution increasing the amount of the contributions of employed members. Plaintiffs, two members of the union, claimed against two members of the executive committee of the union and the union itself a declaration that the alteration adopted at the delegate meeting was invalid:

Held  
(1) as the matter in question was not a mere irregularity in the internal management of the union, but was a matter of substance and tinctured with oppression, the court would grant plaintiffs relief if it was proper to do so;

(2) it was implicit in the rule in _Foss v Harbottle_ (1843) 2 Hare 461; 67 ER 189, that the matter relied on as constituting the cause of action should be a cause of action properly belonging to the general body of members of the association in question as opposed to a cause of action which some individual member could assert in his own right. In the present case, the personal and individual rights of membership of plaintiffs had been invaded, and particular damage inflicted by the invalid alteration of the tables of contributions, and in such circumstances the rule in _Foss v Harbottle_ (supra) had no application to individual members who were suing, not in the right of the union, but in their own right to protect from invasion their individual rights as members, and, therefore, plaintiffs were entitled to their declaration.  

  

Per Jenkins LJ: The rule in _Foss v Harbottle (supra)_ does not prevent an individual member suing if the matter in respect of which he is suing can validly be done, not by a simple majority of the members of the association, but, as in the present case, only by some special majority. I cannot regard the paying by the majority of the members of the increased rates without demur as equivalent to a ballot vote at which a two-thirds majority was obtained in favour of the alteration.
