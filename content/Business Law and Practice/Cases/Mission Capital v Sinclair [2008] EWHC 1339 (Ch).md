# Mission Capital v Sinclair [2008] EWHC 1339 (Ch)

In this case two directors, who were also shareholders, were dismissed from the board of the company and their service contracts were terminated. The company later brought a claim against these two directors, who counterclaimed seeking reinstatement and bringing a derivative claim against the continuing directors. The court refused to give permission to continue the derivative claim under the discretionary grounds, deciding that a notional director acting in accordance with their duty under s 172 to promote the success of the company would give little weight to continuing the claim. The court were also influenced by their finding that the claimants could alternatively bring a claim for unfair prejudice under s 994.
