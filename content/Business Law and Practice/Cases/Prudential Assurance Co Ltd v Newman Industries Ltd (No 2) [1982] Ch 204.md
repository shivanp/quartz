# Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd (No 2) [1982] Ch 204

## Abstract

A minority shareholder must show, prima facie, a case of fraud before the court will give leave to bring a derivative action.

B and C were directors of N Ltd. and also of TPG Ltd. B and C sought to arrange the purchase by N Ltd. of assets of TPG Ltd. Unknown to the board of N Ltd. they agreed with TPG that N Ltd. should buy certain shares owned by TPG and paid TPG a sum of money. Subsequently B recommended to the board that N Ltd. should buy all of TPG's assets. He drafted a circular to the shareholders of N Ltd. recommending that they agree to the purchase, which was duly approved. P, a non-duty shareholder in N Ltd. commenced an action against B, C and TPG on behalf of themselves, other shareholders and N Ltd. alleging conspiracy and fraudulent conduct against B and C. On the defendants' summons the judge refused to order that P's right to maintain the action be determined as a preliminary issue. At trial the judge upheld P's allegations and ruled that the interests of justice required that P be permitted to maintain an action on behalf of N Ltd.

Held, that

(1) certain of the findings against B and C were not substantiated by the evidence;

(2) where fraud was practised on a company, a derivative action should be allowed only where the fraudsters were in control; it is not a practical test that the justice of the case requires an action to be brought, and a shareholder's right to bring a derivative action ought to be determined as a preliminary issue; in the circumstances of this appeal P's status to sue did not fall to be determined;

(3) P's right as shareholder was merely a right of participation on the terms of the articles of association which was not affected by any damage to the company and accordingly the personal and representative actions were misconceived.
