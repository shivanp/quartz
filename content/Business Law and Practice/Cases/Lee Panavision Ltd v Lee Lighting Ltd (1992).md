# Lee Panavision Ltd v Lee Lighting Ltd (1992)

The court considered an allegation of a failure to declare an interest to a company board meeting, met by a defence that the undeclared interest was common to and known by each of the directors.  

Held: Dillon LJ said: ‘if the judge was entitled to make findings of non-disclosure and non-declaration of interests that he did, the position is that each of the directors has failed to disclose formally at the board meeting an interest common to all the directors and, ex hypothesi, already known to all the directors. I would hesitate to hold that such apparently technical non-declaration of an interest in breach of s 317 has the inevitable result, as to which the court has no discretion, that the second management agreement is fundamentally flawed and must be set aside if Lee Lighting chooses to ask sufficiently promptly that it be set aside.’
