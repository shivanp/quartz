# Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153

In this case Tesco was charged with an offence under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 for advertising goods at a reduced price then selling them for a higher price. Tesco argued that the company was not at fault, rather it was the manager of the particular store. The court found that the manager was not the 'guiding mind' and therefore Tesco could not be liable for his actions.

Under the earlier cases, it was difficult to establish liability particularly of more complex companies for torts or crimes that required a mental element. Lord Hoffmann in the case below opened up the possibility of finding liability based on an assessment of the controllers of the company for the purposes of attribution (ie for the particular purposes in question) rather than searching for the 'guiding mind' of the company, which made liability easier to establish.
