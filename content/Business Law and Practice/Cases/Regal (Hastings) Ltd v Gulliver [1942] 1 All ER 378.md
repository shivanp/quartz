# Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver [1942] 1 All ER 378

In this case, Regal owned a cinema in Hastings and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas and then sell all three to an outsider as a going concern. In order to do this, they formed a subsidiary company ('Amalgamated') to lease the other two cinemas. The landlord of the cinemas demanded either a personal guarantee from the directors or that the paid-up capital of Amalgamated be increased to £5,000. As Regal was unable to pay more than £2,000, and the directors did not want to give personal guarantees, the directors subscribed for the additional shares in Amalgamated.

Three weeks later the proposal to sell the cinemas was abandoned and instead the shares in the companies were sold to new purchasers, resulting in the directors who subscribed for the additional shares making a large profit. The new purchasers then brought an action claiming reimbursement of this profit from the four directors, on the grounds that it was a profit owed to the company. Lord Russell stated:

>“… the directors standing in a fiduciary relationship to Regal in regard to the exercise of their powers as directors, and having obtained these shares by reason and only by reason of the fact that they were directors of Regal and in the course of the execution of that office, are accountable for the profits which they have made out of them.”
