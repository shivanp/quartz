# Birch v Cropper (1889) 14 App Cas 525

This case established that where the terms of issue of a class of shares are silent in some respect, there is a presumption that all shareholders rank equally. In this case the company had 5% preference shares and ordinary shares, and the articles provided that dividends should be paid in proportion to the amounts paid up on the shares. There was no express provision dealing with the distribution of assets on a winding up. The House of Lords held that the preference shareholders should therefore participate in the same way as the ordinary shareholders in the distribution of assets on the winding up of the company.
