## Abstract

The liquidator, M, appealed against an order ([2001] 2 B.C.L.C. 1) that the liability of the directors of TMC, B and X, had been satisfied by a payment into court. M sought an order that B and X make such contributions to TMC's assets as the court thought fit and that they be ordered to pay the punitive element by way of contribution in addition to the payment in. B and X cross appealed. TMC had been suffering from commercial problems, exacerbated by onerous rental obligations.

On advice from counsel, a scheme was devised whereby B and X would incorporate a new company also called TMC; when the new TMC was ready to trade, the original TMC would cease to trade as a road haulier and become a lessor of trailers to new TMC for 12 months. It was envisaged that the original TMC would go into liquidation not less than 12 months later; there could then be no objection under the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.216](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/ID713E8D0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c304189f41874cd2867dde971bdcd8da&contextData=(sc.Default)) to new TMC's use of the old company name because B and X would not have been its directors within the 12 months of the original TMC's liquidation. During the course of the 12 months prior to liquidation, R demanded payment of monies due from TMC under leases. To avoid R presenting a winding up petition within the crucial 12 month period, B and X made some payments on account but failed to make a payment promised for December 1993. The judge found that TMC had been trading fraudulently under s.213 of the 1986 Act in relation to the December payment because at the time B and X agreed to make it they knew or intended that no monies would be paid in respect of it.

Held, dismissing the appeal and allowing the cross appeal, that in the light of his findings of fact the judge had been wrong to hold that B and X had been knowingly party to the carrying on of the business with the intent to defraud creditors or for any other fraudulent purpose. Not every fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation perpetrated by a company amounted to fraudulent trading under s.213. **When a fraud on a creditor was perpetrated in the course of carrying on a business, it did not necessarily follow that the business was being carried on with the intent to defraud.** M had not suggested that the carrying on of the business of the company, with the intent to protect the former directors from penalties under s.216 of the Act and with the knowledge that R would be an unpaid creditor, was sufficient of itself to engage s.213. Furthermore, the court did not have a power to include a punitive element in the amount of any contribution to be made.
