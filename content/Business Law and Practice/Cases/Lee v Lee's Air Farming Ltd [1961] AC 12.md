# Lee v Lee's Air Farming Ltd [1961] AC 12

Mr Lee (L) incorporated Lee's Air Farming Ltd in New Zealand in 1954. The nominal capital of the company was £3,000 divided into 3,000 shares of £1 each. L held 2,999 shares and the final share was held by a solicitor (as the New Zealand legislation at the time required companies to have two shareholders). L was also the sole director of the company and was appointed as an employee (the chief pilot) in the company's articles. In 1956 L was killed in a plane crash whilst working, leaving a widow and four infant children. L's widow brought a claim under the Workers' Compensation Act 1922. The Privy Council found that the company and L were distinct legal entities and therefore L under his contract of employment was a 'worker' as defined under the Act. The widow therefore was entitled to compensation and it was irrelevant that L was also the vast majority shareholder and sole director.
