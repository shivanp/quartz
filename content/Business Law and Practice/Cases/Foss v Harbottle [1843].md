# Foss v Harbottle [1843]

## Ratio

Company alone may sue for legal wrong against it.

## Facts

A bill was lodged by two of the proprietors of shares in a company incorporated by Act of Parliament, on their own and the other shareholders’ behalf. They claimed against three bankrupt directors, a proprietor, solicitor and architect charging them with fraudulent transactions misapplying the company’s assets, that there had ceased to be a sufficient number of qualified directors to make up a board, and the company had no clerk or office, that in such circumstance the proprietors had no power to take the property out of the hands of the defendant directors.

## Held

If a company suffers a legal wrong, it is the company itself which must sue in respect of damage resulting from it. The company has its own separate legal identity which must be respected. Observations were made on the point at which a relationship of trust arises between company promoters and the company. The possibility of avoiding a transaction does not necessarily create a void transaction. A corporation may later choose to adopt the transaction, and hold the directors bound by them. They can be confirmed if a transaction is a mortgage not authorised by powers given by the Act, this is an act beyond the powers of the corporation and cannot be confirmed whilst there is any dissenting voice raised against it.

Jenkins LJ said: ‘The proper plaintiff in an action in respect of a wrong alleged to be done to a corporation is, prima facie, the corporation.’
