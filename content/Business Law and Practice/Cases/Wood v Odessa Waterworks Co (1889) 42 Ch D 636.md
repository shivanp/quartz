# Wood v Odessa Waterworks Co (1889) 42 Ch D 636

In this case the company's articles allowed the directors, with the sanction of the shareholders, to declare a dividend 'to be paid' to the shareholders. The company passed an ordinary resolution proposing to pay no dividend but instead give the shareholders debenture-bonds. On the application of W, a shareholder, the court granted an injunction to prevent the company from acting on that resolution as it was inconsistent with the articles.
