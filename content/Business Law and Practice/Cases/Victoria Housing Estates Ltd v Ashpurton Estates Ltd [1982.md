# Victoria Housing Estates Ltd v Ashpurton Estates Ltd [1982

In this case, the charge was created in 1978. It was not discovered until 1981 that the charge had not been registered. The chargee (lender) initially decided to take no action whilst a sale was pending of the relevant assets. However, later in 1981 the chargee received notice of a meeting to wind up the company. As soon as this notice was received, the chargee applied to register the charge.

The court refused to register the charge, stating that the chargee should have made the application as soon as they realised the mistake. If the charge was retrospectively registered, this would prejudice other creditors. As the chargee had waited until they received notice of the meeting to wind up the company, the court would not extend time to register the charge as this would reduce assets available to distribute to other unsecured creditors, thereby prejudicing their interests. The charge was therefore void, and the lender was an unsecured creditor.
