# Charterbridge Corpn Ltd v Lloyd's Bank Ltd (1970)

An act of a company within the scope of the powers expressed in its memorandum is not ultra vires merely because its director had a foreign purpose in mind when, on the company’s behalf, he performed the act in question.

Under its memorandum, C Limited’s first object was to acquire lands for investment with a strictly qualified power of realisation. It was given power

> ‘to secure or guarantee by mortgages, charges or otherwise the performance and discharge of any contract, obligation, or liability of the company or of any other person or corporation with whom or which the company has dealings or having a business or undertaking in which the company is concerned or interested whether directly or indirectly.’

Power was also given for joint adventure or agreement for co-operation, and to do ‘such things as may be incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above-mentioned objects.’ Each sub-clause was to be deemed to be independent. Mr P and his wife were the sole shareholders and directors of C Limited which was one of a group of companies at the head at which was P Limited. The basic business of the group was property development. In December 1960 the accounts which P Limited, and two other companies in the group had at defendant bank were overdrawn. The bank pressed for better security, and Mr P and other companies in the group gave a chain of guarantees including one whereby C Limited guaranteed payment of liabilities incurred by P Limited to the bank with a limit of £30,000.

In March 1962 C Limited executed a legal charge in favour of defendant bank over leasehold property known as ‘Castleford’ to secure its indebtedness to the bank including its guarantee. This was subject to a first mortgage previously granted to A. Mr P, in causing C Limited to enter into the guarantee and legal charge, looked to the interests of the group as a whole and did not consider C Limited’s interests separately.

In April 1962 C Limited agreed to sell ‘Castleford’ to plaintiff company at a price of more than £30,000. Plaintiff company paid £20,000 almost all of which was applied in discharging the first mortgage in favour of A, leaving the bank at first mortgage. Plaintiff company later paid a further £10,000. In December 1962 C Limited and plaintiff company entered into a new sale agreement superseding the earlier one.

Subsequently, plaintiff company learnt that C Limited could not make a good title. The bank demanded repayment by C Limited, and threatened to realise the security. Plaintiff company then issued a writ seeking a declaration that the legal charge in favour of defendant bank was void as being ultra vires. On the question of Mr P’s failure to consider separately the interests of C Limited:

Held the declaration would not be made because Mr P’s failure to consider separately the interests of C Limited, when, on its behalf, he effected the charge in favour of defendant bank, did not render the execution of the charge ultra vires.
