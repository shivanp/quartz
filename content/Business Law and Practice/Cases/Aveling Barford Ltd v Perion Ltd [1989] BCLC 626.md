# Aveling Barford Ltd v Perion Ltd [1989] BCLC 626

In this case there were two companies, AB Ltd and P Ltd, which were both owned and controlled by the same shareholder, Lee. AB Ltd did not have any distributable reserves, but it owned a sports ground valued at £650,000. In February 1987, AB Ltd sold the sports ground to P Ltd for £350,000. In August 1987, P Ltd sold the sports ground for £1.52 million. AB Ltd then went into liquidation and the liquidator successfully sued to have P Ltd declared a constructive trustee of the proceeds of the sale on the basis that the transaction was an unauthorised return of capital (or a “disguised distribution”) by AB Ltd to Lee, its sole shareholder, via P Ltd.
