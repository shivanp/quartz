# Abbington Hotel Ltd [2011] EWHC 635

## Summary

The date at which shares in a company should be valued for the purpose of their purchase by shareholders who had petitioned under the [Companies Act 2006 s.994](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D4223108B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=99cb5c782a064dbaaa3ee8cff0cccbcb&contextData=(sc.Default)) for an order that they be entitled to purchase the remaining shareholder's shares was the date at which expert evidence was first produced: a date that would remedy the prejudice suffered by the petitioner's early exclusion from the company's management.

## Abstract

The court was required to determine whether to exercise its discretion to order that shares in a company (C) held by the cross-petitioning shareholders (Y) be sold to the petitioning shareholders (X).

C had been incorporated as a vehicle for a joint venture for the acquisition of a hotel. X and Y were married couples who held equal shares in C. The husbands were also directors of C. Relations between the couples broke down. Mr Y entered into negotiations to sell the hotel, drawing up a minute of a purported meeting between the parties which alleged that Mr X had agreed to the sale. Mr X disputed that he had agreed to any such sale. Thereafter, Mr X gradually excluded Y from involvement in C's management and affairs. X petitioned the court under the [Companies Act 2006 s.994](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D4223108B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=99cb5c782a064dbaaa3ee8cff0cccbcb&contextData=(sc.Default)) for an order that Y sell their shares to them. Y cross-petitioned for an order that X sell their shares to them. At the hearing, Y agreed that X should purchase their shares. Consequently, the issues for determination were  
(i) whether there had been unfairly prejudicial conduct so as to enable the court to exercise its discretion under s.994;  
(ii) the date at which the shares should be valued.

X submitted that Y had acted in breach of the parties' original understanding that the hotel would be retained as a going concern and had created a minute which falsely represented X's consent to the hotel being sold, and that the appropriate valuation date was the date at which expert evidence had been updated and the case was ready for trial. Y contended that the shares should be valued at an earlier date so as to remedy the prejudice caused by their exclusion from participation in C's management and to reflect the date at which the first round of expert evidence was prepared.

## Held

Petition granted in part.

(1) X and Y had established a case of unfairly prejudicial conduct. In seeking to negotiate and progress a sale of the hotel and producing a false minute of a purported shareholder agreement, Mr Y had acted in breach of an original understanding between the parties as to the purpose behind C's purchase of the hotel, effectively destroying the relationship of trust and confidence between the parties, _[O'Neill v Phillips [1999] 1 W.L.R. 1092, [1999] 5 WLUK 312](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I11D8DA20E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=99cb5c782a064dbaaa3ee8cff0cccbcb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.

That breach had not been remedied or cured by Mr Y's exclusion from C's management; X and Y had equal shareholdings so Mr Y could not lawfully be removed as a director and he had not resigned, _[Legal Costs Negotiators Ltd, Re [1999] B.C.C. 547, [1999] 2 WLUK 299](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6FDFDD40E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=99cb5c782a064dbaaa3ee8cff0cccbcb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. In excluding Y from any participation as a director and as members of C, Mr X had also acted in an unfairly prejudicial manner. Accordingly, the court had jurisdiction to grant relief under [s.996](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D42BF508B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=99cb5c782a064dbaaa3ee8cff0cccbcb&contextData=(sc.Default)) to order that X purchase Y's shares (see paras [98, 105, 111, 116, 119-122](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The date by which the expert evidence had been updated was not a date that had any obvious connection with the prejudice to be remedied by the exercise of the court's jurisdiction. The appropriate valuation date was the date on which the first round of expert evidence had been produced, which would have the effect of remedying the prejudice suffered by Y as a result of their relatively early exclusion from C's management and affairs (paras [138-141](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
