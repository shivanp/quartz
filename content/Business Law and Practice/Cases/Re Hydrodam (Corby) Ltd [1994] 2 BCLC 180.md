# Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 180

 

 In this case, the issue was whether two directors of the parent company could be deemed to be shadow directors of its subsidiary company and therefore liable for wrongful trading under s 214 Insolvency Act 1986. Millett J said that to establish if a person is a shadow director, it is necessary to prove:

1. The identity of the formally-appointed directors of the company;
2. That the person in question directed those formally appointed directors as to how to act in relation to the company’s affairs;
3. That those directors acted in accordance with that person’s directions, and
4. That the directors were accustomed to acting in that manner.

It is a question of fact in every case. A controlling shareholder, a holding company or directors of a holding company could be said to be a shadow director if the directors are accustomed to acting in accordance with their directions.

 Wrongful trading liability extends to de facto as well as de jure directors. The proceedings arose in the liquidation of H, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of E. The liquidator sought orders for wrongful trading against several defendants including E, a subsidiary of E (of which H was a subsidiary) and E's directors. The directors of H were two Channel Island companies. In seeking the orders against the directors of E, the liquidator submitted that liability under the Insolvency Act 1986 s.214 extended to shadow directors and that the directors of E acted as de facto or shadow directors of H.

Held, that

1. liability for wrongful trading extends to de facto directors as well as de jure and shadow directors;
2. the terms de facto and shadow director are alternatives and are in most cases mutually exclusive. A de facto director is one who claims to act and purports to act as a director whereas a shadow director claims not to be a director and is not held out as a director; and
3. the directors of a parent company which was stated to be a shadow director of a subsidiary would not necessarily themselves be shadow directors of the subsidiary.
