# Bray v Ford [1896] AC 44

Lord Herschell:

> “It is an inflexible rule of a court of equity that a person in a fiduciary position … is not, unless otherwise expressly provided … allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and duty conflict. It does not appear to me that this rule is … founded upon principles of morality. I regard it rather as based on the consideration that, human nature being what it is, there is a danger, in such circumstances, of the person holding a fiduciary position being swayed by interest rather than by duty, and thus prejudicing those whom he was bound to protect. It has, therefore, been deemed expedient to lay down this positive rule.”
