# Re Legal Costs Negotiators Ltd [1999] 2 BCLC 171 CA

This company was incorporated by four individuals who were equal shareholders, directors and employees. Unfortunately, relations broke down and the fourth individual was dismissed an employee and resigned as a director just before he was to be removed. He remained as a shareholder and refused to sell his shares to the other three, who petitioned under s 459 seeking an order that he transfer his shares to them. The Court of Appeal rejected this petition on the basis that the other three shareholders, being the majority, could prevent any prejudice from this shareholder. It was held that simply remaining as a shareholder was not conduct relating to the company's affairs.
