# Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500

 In this case Lord Hoffmann considered the case law and concluded that the real issue was who were the 'controllers' of the company for the purposes of attribution, not the 'guiding minds'. In this case the controllers on the facts were found to be two senior managers and the company was accordingly liable. This case allowed the attribution of liability to the company for the acts of individuals lower down the organisational structure.
