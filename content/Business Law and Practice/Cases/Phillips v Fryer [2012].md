# Phillips v Fryer [2012]

## Summary

Permission to continue with a derivative claim was granted where directors, who had allegedly wrongfully taken their company's money in breach of their fiduciary duties, had failed to produce a convincing explanation in defence to the allegations.

## Abstract

The applicant director and shareholder (P) applied for permission to continue a derivative claim on behalf of the fourth respondent company (C) against the first and second respondents (F), who were also directors and shareholders of C.

P and F each held 50 per cent of C's shares. P alleged that F had made substantial unauthorised withdrawals and payments from C's account, and brought proceedings against them for unfairly prejudicial conduct under the [Companies Act 2006 s.994](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D4223108B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=02f34d52e61348ce87581aa48c006e46&contextData=(sc.Search)) in which he sought to recover those monies. P also sought an order for the sale of F's shares to him. The third respondent (R) was a company controlled by F which P alleged had received some of those monies.

P contended that urgency was required because F had continued to wrongfully take C's money after the petition was issued, and submitted that it was expedient to permit a derivative claim, in which he could seek summary judgment, because that would take significantly less time than the six-day estimate for his existing unfair prejudice petition. F argued that all of the issues could be resolved, if appropriate by seeking a summary hearing of the petition, in the existing proceedings.

## Held

Application granted.

The instant case was different to _[Stainer v Lee [2010] EWHC 1539 (Ch), [2011] B.C.C. 134, [2010] 6 WLUK 715](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6F835A4083DB11DF9FA89FAD21B8274B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=02f34d52e61348ce87581aa48c006e46&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Kiani v Cooper [2010] EWHC 577 (Ch), [2010] B.C.C. 463, [2010] 2 WLUK 111](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA83B71A1121711DF8A46D603592D5391/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=02f34d52e61348ce87581aa48c006e46&contextData=(sc.Search))_ because P sought an order enabling him to acquire F's 50 per cent shareholding and had brought and pursued proceedings to achieve that end, and in his petition he sought precisely what was sought in the derivative action, namely an order requiring F and R to repay the sums wrongfully taken or an order authorising him to bring civil proceedings in C's name, Stainer and Kiani considered. The onus was therefore on P to show why he should be permitted to change his mind and bring a derivative claim in addition to his petition. Whilst it was not for the instant court to determine the merits of P's claim, F had not provided a convincing explanation in response to P's allegations, either in their defence to the petition or in their response to the instant application. There was no question as to P's bona fides and the fact that he was doing his best to recover the money he claimed had been taken as quickly as possible, and to stop further money from being taken. That was exactly what any director, seeking to promote the interests of his company, would do in accordance with [s.172](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5BF3F8308B3311DBA1DB80994EEB92DE/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=02f34d52e61348ce87581aa48c006e46&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the Act. Without pre-judging its outcome, there were grounds for P making a summary judgment application which was unlikely to take as long as six days to hear. Further, there were additional claims not made in the petition, which would have had to be amended to raise them. In those circumstances, a derivative claim was the better way of proceeding and the court granted P's application (see paras 18-20, 24 of judgment).
