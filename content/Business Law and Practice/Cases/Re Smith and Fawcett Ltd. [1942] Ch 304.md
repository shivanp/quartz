# Re Smith and Fawcett Ltd. [1942] Ch 304

The primary duty of a director imposed by the general law is that he should act in what he considers to be the best interests of the company, and not for any collateral purpose. That duty is a subjective one that depends on the directors exercising their discretionary powers bona fide in what they, and not the court, consider to be in the interests of the company. Lord Greene MR said:

> ‘The principles to be applied in cases where the articles of a company confer a discretion on directors are, for present purposes, free from doubt. They must exercise their discretion bona fide in what they consider — not what a court may consider — is in the interests of the company, and not for any collateral purpose. The question, therefore, simply is whether on the true construction of the particular article the directors are limited by anything except their bona fide view as to the interests of the company.’

(1) Article 10 of the articles of association of a private company provided: ‘The directors may at any time in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion refuse to register any transfer of shares, and cl 19 of Table A shall be modified accordingly.’ The issued capital of the company consisted of 8,002 ordinary shares, of which the two directors of the company, JF & NS, held 4,001 each. JF died, and his son, as his executor, applied to have testator’s shares registered in his name. NS refused to consent to the registration, but offered to register 2,001 shares and to buy 2,000 at a fixed price. The executor applied to the court that the register of members of the company might be rectified by inserting his name as the holder of the 4,001 shares: Held art 10 gave the directors the widest powers to refuse to register a transfer, and, while such powers are of a fiduciary nature and must be exercised in the interest of the company, there was nothing to show that they had been otherwise exercised;  
(2) affidavit evidence is unsatisfactory evidence of the motives of directors in exercising their powers.
