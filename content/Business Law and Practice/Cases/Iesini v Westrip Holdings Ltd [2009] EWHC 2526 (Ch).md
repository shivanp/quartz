# Iesini v Westrip Holdings Ltd [2009] EWHC 2526 (Ch)

In this case the court found that the directors had not breached their duties so there were no grounds for launching a derivative claim. Lewinson J in this case reviewed the statutory procedure, noting that the first stage is considered on the basis of the evidence filed by the applicant only, without requiring evidence from the defendant or the company, and at the second stage, something more than a prima facie case must be needed but the court cannot embark on a mini trial of the action.
