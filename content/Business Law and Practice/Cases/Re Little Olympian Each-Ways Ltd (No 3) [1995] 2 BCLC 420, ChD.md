# Re Little Olympian Each-Ways Ltd (No 3) [1995] 2 BCLC 420, ChD

## Facts

A Jersey company (Supreme) had brought a petition under the section against the company. An application was made for security for costs against Supreme. It could only be made if Supreme was resident outside the UK. Supreme argued that, despite being a Jersey company, it was resident in the United Kingdom, and that therefore the order could not be made against it.  

## Held

It was resident in Jersey and the court made the order. The board members were partners in a firm of Jersey advocates. It was run from the offices of that firm. Its only asset was a holding of shares in Little Olympian Each Ways Ltd. An individual who lived in England, Mr Lemos, said that he provided central management and control of Supreme, but he gave no details, and the judge was unimpressed.

A letter from one of the Jersey advocates who were directors said that if Mr Lemos was ever to give instructions to them directly he (the Jersey advocate/director) would act in accordance with them provided that he was satisfied that they were consistent with Jersey company law and with the interests of the two persons who were understood to be interested in the share capital. The court referred to ‘the shadowy nature’ of Supreme, but held it to be resident in Jersey.  

The ordinary residence of company for the purposes of RSC Ord. 23 is with the central management and control.
