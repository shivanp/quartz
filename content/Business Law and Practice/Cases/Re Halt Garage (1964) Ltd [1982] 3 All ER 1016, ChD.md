# Re Halt Garage (1964) Ltd [1982] 3 All ER 1016, ChD

This case illustrates the importance of ensuring that directors' salaries are correctly paid, particularly for directors who are also shareholders. In this case, the director receiving remuneration was the wife of the majority shareholder, who had not in fact worked for the company for several years due to ill health. The company had gone into insolvent liquidation and the court held that the remuneration paid to the director was a disguised gift out of capital and ordered it to be repaid.
