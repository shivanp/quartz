# Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa [1900] 1 Ch 656

Served as a marginal form of minority shareholder protection at common law, before the existence of any unfair prejudice remedy.

---

A company by one of its articles provided that it should have a lien for all debts and liabilities of any member to the company ‘upon all shares, not being fully paid, held by such member.’ The company, by way of purchase-money for the property acquired by it, allotted fully-paid shares to Z, a nominee of the vendor to the company. Z also applied for and had allotted to him shares not paid up. He was the only holder of fully paid-up shares. At his death, he was indebted to the company in arrears of calls on the unpaid shares, but his assets were insufficient to pay the arrears. Thereupon the company, by special resolution under 1882 Act, s 50 (repealed), altered the above article by omitting therefrom the words ‘not being fully paid,’ thus creating a lien on Z’s fully-paid shares: Held the company had power to alter its articles by extending its lien to fully-paid shares.

(1) A limited company by one of its articles provided that it should have a lien on all debts and liabilities of any member to the company ‘upon all shares—not being fully paid—held by such member.’ The company, by way of purchase money for the property acquired by it, allotted fully paid shares to Z, a nominee of the vendor to the company. Z also applied for and had allotted to him shares not paid up. He was the only holder of fully paid-up shares. At his death, he was indebted to the company in arrears of calls on the unpaid shares, but his assets were insufficient to pay the arrears. Thereupon the company, by special resolution under 1862 Act s 50 (repealed), altered the above article by omitting therefrom the words ‘not being fully paid,’ thus creating a lien on Z’s fully paid shares: Held (a) the company had power to alter its articles by extending its lien to fully paid shares; (b) the lien so extended, having been made in good faith, was enforceable against Z’s fully paid shares, since he took them subject to the original articles and the power of altering them given to the company by 1862 Act s 50 (repealed), and did not make any special or implied bargain that they should not be affected by any subsequent alteration of the articles; and the fact of those shares being vendor’s shares allotted in payment for the property purchased by the company, instead of being shares paid for in cash in the ordinary way, was immaterial.  

  

(2) I am of the opinion that the articles can be so altered [as to impose a lien or restriction in respect of a debt contracted before and existing at the time when the articles are so altered], and that if they are altered bona fide for the benefit of the company they will be valid and binding as altered on the existing holders of paid-up shares, whether such holders are indebted or not indebted to the company when the alteration is made. But, it does not by any means follow that the altered article may not be inapplicable to some particular fully paid-up shareholder. He may have special rights against the company, which do not invalidate the resolution to alter the articles, but which may exempt him from the operation of the articles as altered (Lindley, MR).  

  

(3) We are all agreed that a company cannot contract itself out of the statutory power of alteration conferred by [1862 Act] s 50 (repealed). I take it to be clear that the alteration must be made in good faith and that an alteration in the articles which involved oppression of one shareholder would not be made in good faith.
