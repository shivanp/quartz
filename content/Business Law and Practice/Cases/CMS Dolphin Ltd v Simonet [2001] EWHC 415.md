# CMS Dolphin Ltd v Simonet [2001] EWHC 415

S and B founded CMS, an advertising agency but later fell out. S resigned as managing director and set up in business, firstly under the trade name Millennium and later as a company, Blue (GB) Ltd. Following S's resignation, all the staff of CMS left to join him in his new business, as did all the principal clients.

The court held that in exploiting a “maturing business opportunity” of the company after resignation, S was in breach of his fiduciary duties. It was held that S became a “constructive trustee of the fruits of his abuse of the company's property, which he has acquired in circumstances where he knowingly had a conflict of interest, and exploited it by resigning from the company.”
