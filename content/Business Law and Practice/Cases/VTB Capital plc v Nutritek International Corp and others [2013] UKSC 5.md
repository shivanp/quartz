# VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corp and others [2013] UKSC 5

The claimant (VTB) lent Russagroprom LLC (RAP) money to fund the acquisition of six Russian dairy plants and three associated companies from the first defendant (Nutritek). RAP defaulted on the loan. VTB claimed it only lent the money on the basis of misrepresentations made by Nutritek for which the other defendants were jointly liable. It claimed that RAP was in fact under the control of the defendants and that once the corporate veil was pierced, the defendants could be seen to have been parties to the contract, on the agency argument. This was rejected by the court.

In this case the court left open the question of whether there exists any principled basis on which courts can pierce the veil, but refused to pierce the veil in this case, as it found that VTB could claim damages against the other defendants on the basis of the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation. The veil was not pierced in this case because of the existence of the alternative remedy in misrepresentation.
