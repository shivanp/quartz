# Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433

Cape, an English company, was the parent company of a group of wholly owned subsidiaries, some of which mined asbestos in South Africa and others marketed the asbestos in other countries, including the US. The employees of the Texas subsidiary company NAAC became ill with asbestosis and sued Cape and NAAC in the Texas court. Judgment was entered for breach of duty of care.

The issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the judgment could be enforced against the much wealthier parent company, Cape, in the English court, since Cape's assets were all based in England. NAAC had by that time been closed down by Cape. The requirement for this was either that Cape consented to the Texas jurisdiction (which it did not) or that Cape was 'present' in the US in Texas. The claimants argued

1. That Cape and its subsidiaries should be treated as a single economic unit,
2. That the subsidiaries were used as a fa√ßade concealing the true facts, and that
3. An agency relationship existed between Cape and NAAC.

The Court of Appeal rejected all these arguments and held that the judgment could not be enforced against Cape. Note that this case was a leading authority on 'piercing the corporate veil' prior to the 2013 case of [[Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] 2 AC 415]] and you will return to look at it again in this context in the next element.

## Abstract

For the purpose of enforcement of a foreign judgment, a defendant will only be regarded as falling under the jurisdiction of the foreign court where it was present within the jurisdiction or had submitted to such jurisdiction. Until 1979, Cape, an English company, mined and marketed asbestos. Its worldwide marketing subsidiary was another English company, Capasco. It also had a US marketing subsidiary incorporated in Illinois, NAAC. In 1974, some 462 plaintiffs sued Cape, Capasco, NAAC and others in Tyler, Texas, for personal injuries allegedly arising from the installation of asbestos in a factory. These actions were settled. Between 1978 and 1979, a further 206 similar actions were commenced and default judgments entered against Cape and Capasco. In 1978, NAAC ceased to carry on business and other subsidiaries replaced it. The plaintiffs sought to enforce the judgments in England. The defendants denied that the Texas court had jurisdiction over them for the purposes of English law.

Held, that the defendants were neither present within the US, nor had they submitted to the jurisdiction there. The method of computing damages of the individual plaintiffs was contrary to the English law concept of natural justice. Accordingly, the actions would be dismissed, _[Pemberton v Hughes [1899] 1 Ch. 781, [1899] 2 WLUK 57](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1D8AEE80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ca8c7b844b044d5fa8b273a7e734d25b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Okura & Co Ltd v Forsbacka Jernverks AB [1914] 1 K.B. 715, [1914] 1 WLUK 40](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I13E96AA1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ca8c7b844b044d5fa8b273a7e734d25b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Littauer Glove Corp v FW Millington (1928) 44 T.L.R. 746, [1928] 1 WLUK 7](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE4A03260E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ca8c7b844b044d5fa8b273a7e734d25b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _Jacobson v Frachon (1928) 138 L.T. 386, [1928] 1 WLUK 6_ and _[Vogel v R & A Kohnstamm Ltd [1973] Q.B. 133, [1971] 4 WLUK 54](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE7AE3731E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ca8c7b844b044d5fa8b273a7e734d25b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
