# Bushell v Faith [1970] AC 1099 (House of Lords)

In this case the company had a share capital of £300 in £1 shares. Mr Faith held 100 shares, as did each of his sisters, Mrs Bushell and Dr Bayne. The three siblings were also the directors of the company. The company’s articles stated:

> ‘In the event of a resolution being proposed at any general meeting of the company for the removal from office of any director, any shares held by that director shall on a poll in respect of such resolution carry the right to three votes per share…’

Faith therefore was able to defeat a resolution proposed by his sisters to remove him from office as a director as on this resolution he had 300 votes to his sisters’ collective 200 votes. The court held that this article was valid and effective.
