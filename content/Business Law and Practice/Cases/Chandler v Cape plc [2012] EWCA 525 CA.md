# Chandler v Cape plc [2012] EWCA 525 CA

  The Court of Appeal stated that Cape plc assumed responsibility to Mr Chandler and owed a direct duty of care to Mr Chandler, which it breached. The Court of Appeal stressed that the duty of care from a parent company to subsidiary employees did not exist automatically and only arose in particular circumstances. That is, there was no imposition or assumption of responsibility to the employee by reason only that the defendant was the parent company: parent companies have a separate legal personality, and it should, as a rule, not be possible to “pierce the corporate veil”.

  

  However, in the case of Cape plc, the Court of Appeal identified parallel duties of care between the parent company and subsidiary employees and the subsidiary company and its employees. This was because:

- (i) the parent company and subsidiary had relatively similar businesses;
- (ii) the parent company knew (or ought to have known) that the subsidiary’s system of work was unsafe; and
- (iii) the parent company knew (or ought to have foreseen) that the subsidiary or its employees would rely on its using that superior knowledge the employee’s protection.

  The case results in case law catching up with the group/subsidiary corporate structures that are now relatively common. It is likely that courts will look at group structures holistically. Moreover, the country of incorporation of a subsidiary is unlikely to make a difference if the parent entity is a UK plc.  
  In particular, in the case of M&A transactions involving the sale or purchase of a subsidiary entity, parties will need to think about contingent and residual liability issues arising for parent companies.
