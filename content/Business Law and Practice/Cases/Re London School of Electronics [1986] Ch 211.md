# Re London School of Electronics [1986] Ch 211

**Facts**: a petition was presented under what is now CA 2006, s 994, by the holder of 25% of the shares in the company, whose business was providing further education courses. The other 75% of the shares were held by a company called City Tutorial College Ltd.

**Issue**: Two directors of London School of Electronic Ltd, who were also directors and principal shareholders in City Tutorial College Ltd, caused London School of Electronics to transfer many of its students to City Tutorial College Ltd thus depriving the petitioner of his 25% in the profits to be made from those students.

**Held**: Depriving the petitioner of the profits was a prejudicial conduct and the court ordered City Tutorial College to buy the petitionerâ€™s shares, which should be valued as if the students had not been transferred.
