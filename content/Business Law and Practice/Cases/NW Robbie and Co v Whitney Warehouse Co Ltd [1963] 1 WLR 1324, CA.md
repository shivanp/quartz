# NW Robbie and Co v Whitney Warehouse Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 1324, CA

## Abstract

1. X cannot set off against a claim by Y a debt owing by Y which was assigned to X after Y ceased to be beneficially interested in the claim he is making.
2. A company is not beneficially interested for this purpose in debts accruing to it after a floating charge on its assets has crystallised, as the debenture-holder is beneficially interested in those debts. A bank put a receiver and manager into the business of Co. Y under a debenture which provided that he should be Co. Y's agent, and the floating charge under the debenture thereupon crystallised. Co. Y had previously sold goods to Co. X on credit for GBP 95 and Co. Y now sold further goods (on which the charge had crystallised) to Co. X for GBP 1,251 6s. 1d. Co. Y also brought goods from Co. P on credit for GBP 852 18s. 4d. and Co. P later assigned its debt to Co. X which, when Co. Y sued for its total debt of GBP 1,346 6s. 1d., sought to set off the GBP 852 18s. 4d.

Held, (Donovan L.J. dissenting) that this sum could not be set off against Co. Y's claim, in which the bank, not Co. Y, was beneficially interested at the time Co. X took its assignment.
