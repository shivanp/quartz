# Fulham Football Club Ltd v Cabra Estates plc [1994] 1 BCLC 363 (Court of Appeal)

In this case, the directors of Fulham Football Club contracted with the landlords of the football ground which they held on lease that they would not oppose any future application which the landlords might make for development of the ground, in return for a substantial fee. The directors later wished to go back on this and argued that it was an unlawful fetter on their ability to act in the best interests of the company in the future.

 Neil LJ stated:

>“There are many kinds of transaction in which the proper time for the exercise of the directors’ discretion is the time of the negotiation of a contract and not the time at which the contract is to be performed.… If at the former time they are bona fide of opinion that it is in the interests of the company that the transaction should be entered into effect I see no reason in law why they should not bind themselves.”
