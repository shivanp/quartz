# Re Bird Precision Bellows Ltd (1984) [1986] Ch 658, CA

The company, which was formed to combine one party’s expertise in the manufacturing of precision bellows with the general experience of two others in financial, commercial and industrial matters. For several years the company’s affairs had worked smoothly and prospered until in a spirit of mutual recrimination, at an extraordinary general meeting two of the directors, the plaintiff minority shareholders were removed. The majority consented to an order to purchase the minority interests, and the parties asked the court to settle the price.  
The judge had ordered payment of the value of the shares pro rata, without deduction of the usual element for the fact that they were minority shareholdings. The majority appealed.  

Held: In acting under the Act, the judge was exercising an unfettered discretion. He had only to do what he thought just and equitable in the circumstances to remedy the fault. The appropriate remedy was one which would ‘put right and cure for the future the unfair prejudice which the petitioner has suffered at the hands of the other shareholders of the company.’ He had properly allowed for the fact that the business had developed from a quasi-partnership. The fact that the order was made by consent created no inference that an open market value would be used.
