# Madoff Securities International Ltd v Raven [2013] EWHC 3147

The facts of this case were complex. It was part of wider litigation concerning a US company which had been used for a fraudulent scheme set up by Madoff (M). Investors in the scheme lost about US$19.5 million. This case concerned an English company used to launder money and make payments of stolen money, in which 99% of the shares were held by M and 1% by his brother, who acted in accordance with his instructions. The company brought proceedings against its directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty.

The defendants alleged that there was no breach of fiduciary duty as this had either been approved by the shareholders or ratified, and sought to strike out the claim. This was not accepted by the court, which considered that “public policy demands that a transaction which is not honest, bona fide and in the best interests of the company is not binding on the company.” The court also reviewed and approved authorities which set out the principle that shareholders cannot ratify a transaction which jeopardises the company's solvency or causes loss to its creditors (although this was not the case here).

Popplewell J stated that in discharging the duty under s 173 it is legitimate for there to be division and delegation of responsibility for particular aspects of the management of a company. However, he went on to state that:

>“…each individual director owes inescapable personal responsibilities. He owes duties to the company to inform himself of the company's affairs and join with his fellow directors in supervising them. It is therefore a breach of duty for a director to allow himself to be dominated, bamboozled or manipulated by a dominant fellow director…”
