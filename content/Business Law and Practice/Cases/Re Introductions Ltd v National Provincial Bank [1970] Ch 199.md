# Re Introductions Ltd v National Provincial Bank [1970] Ch 199

In this case the company, which was incorporated in 1951 at the time of the Festival of Britain, had an object of providing foreign visitors with accommodation and entertainment. The company later diversified into pig breeding, which was (understandably) not covered by the objects clause. The bank were unable to enforce a debenture as a secured creditor or claim as an unsecured creditor in the company's liquidation, since the company was held to have acted ultra vires.
