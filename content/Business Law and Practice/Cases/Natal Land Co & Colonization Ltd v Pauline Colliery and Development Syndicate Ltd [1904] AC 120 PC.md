# Natal Land Co & Colonization Ltd v Pauline Colliery and Development Syndicate Ltd [1904] AC 120 PC

A company cannot by adoption or ratification obtain the benefit of a contract purporting to have been made on its behalf before the company came into existence. In order to do so a new contract must be made with it after its incorporation on the terms of the old one.

---

The respondents sued, under the circumstances stated in the judgment of their Lordships, for specific performance of an agreement of lease, and execution of a proper deed of lease. The appellants pleaded that there was no privity of contract between themselves and the respondents.

The agreement sought to be enforced was contained in correspondence beginning on December 9, 1897, between the appellants' agent and Mrs. de Carrey. The respondents claimed the benefit of this contract under a cession to a trustee for them, as about to be incorporated, by Mrs. de Carrey of her rights thereunder by a deed of December 22, 1897, and a letter by the appellants dated December 30, 1897, to the solicitor of the syndicate in answer to their letter of the 29th, agreeing to the substitution of the syndicate for Mrs. de Carrey.

The appellants contended at the trial that, inasmuch as the respondents were not registered at the date of these transactions and not till January 22, 1898, there was no privity *121 of contract between them. The respondents contended that there was sufficient evidence from which the Court could infer a contract between them. The Court decreed specific performance of the agreement on the following grounds:—

> “Allowing that there was no valid agreement between the defendant company and the Pauline Syndicate on December 29, before their registration, we consider that the subsequent occupation and working of the land in question by the syndicate, the expenditure of money on the land in faith of the agreement, the acceptance by the defendant company of the payment of 100l. as a guarantee for prospecting operations, the recognition by the company of the syndicate as working under an agreement to prospect this land with a view to obtaining a lease, and the correspondence which took place after the date of registration with the defendant company, are inconsistent with any other reasonable conclusion than the actual existence of an agreement between the plaintiff syndicate and the defendant company on the basis of the contract contracted with Mrs. de Carrey on December 9, 1897. There has been part performance on the faith of an existing agreement, and the acts of both parties are unequivocally referable to the contract sued upon.”

Danckwerts, K.C., and McSwinney, for the appellants, contended that there was no evidence from which any agreement in the terms of the agreement sued upon could be implied. On the contrary, the evidence was inconsistent with such an agreement. The acts of the appellants on which the Court relied were all referable to the mistaken belief of Rycroft, the appellants' manager, that the persons who occupied and conducted boring operations on the coal company's lots were the syndicate or partnership in existence on December 30, 1897, and his mistaken belief that he was throughout dealing with such persons only. Even if the partnership acquired Mrs. de Carrey's rights under the agreement, it could not transfer them, and, accordingly, no such rights were ever acquired by the respondents. There was thus no privity between the appellants and respondents as respects the agreement of December 9, *122 and no evidence of any new contract having been made, and no intention shewn on the appellants' part to accept lessees of limited liability in place of the lessees contemplated by the actual agreements made by them.

Haldane, K.C., and Boydell Houghton, for the respondents, contended that the contract of December 9 was valid, and its alteration on the 29th and 30th of that month gave Mrs. de Carrey the right to substitute the syndicate or the respondents as parties thereto. By her signature to the respondents' articles of association she did so substitute the respondents. In the alteration there was sufficient evidence of the creation of a new contract between the appellants and the respondents in terms of the old one, and the Court below had rightly found in its favour. It appears that the appellants acquiesced in the exercise by the respondents of the right to extend the option of prospecting contained in the contract, in their prospecting during the whole of the extended term, in their expenditure of money in prospecting and boring operations.

The judgment of their Lordships was delivered by

LORD DAVEY.

The appellants are an incorporated joint stock company, having their head office in London. Prior to and in the month of December, 1897, a Mr. Rycroft was their general manager in Natal under a power of attorney dated October 26, 1888, by the terms of which he was empowered to sell and lease the company's lands in the Colony and to make contracts for these purposes. On December 9, 1897, Rycroft, on behalf of the appellants, made a contract with a Mrs. de Carrey respecting the coal mining rights in 3000 odd acres of land belonging to the appellants, and known as the Coal Company's Lots. The terms of this agreement are contained in seven letters extending from November 30 to December 9, 1897, between Rycroft and Messrs. Shepstone, Wylie & Binns, then acting as solicitors for Mrs. de Carrey. The material terms are as follows: (1.) Mrs. de Carrey was to have an option, i.e., a right of prospecting for coal, for six months from December 20, 1897, with power to extend the option for a further *123 period of three months; (2.) the option was not assignable; (3.) that Mrs. de Carrey should have the right during the continuance of the option to call for a lease of the coal mining rights for a term of three years, subject to payment of certain rents and royalties, with power to extend the term to thirty-one years; (4.) Mrs. de Carrey was to have the right to sell the lease to a joint stock company fulfilling certain specified conditions; (5.) Mrs. de Carrey was to pay or hand over to the appellants 25 per cent. of the value received from the sale of the lease in shares or cash or both at the option of the appellants; (6.) Mrs. de Carrey was to pay the appellants 100l., to be forfeited in case the lease was not taken ups but to be repaid on compliance with certain conditions.

By an agreement dated December 22, 1897, and expressed to be made between William Louch, “in his capacity as a provisional director of the Pauline Colliery and Developing Syndicate about to be registered … under the laws of the” South African “Republic,” of the one part and Mrs. de Carrey of the other part, Mrs. de Carrey sold and purported to assign to Louch all her interest in (inter alia) the above option in consideration of 300l. cash and 10,000 shares in the syndicate. Mr. Rycroft was not informed of this agreement or of the assignment purported to be made by Mrs. de Carrey, and did not in fact know of it until December 17, 1898.

On December 29, 1897, the solicitors acting for Mrs. de Carrey wrote to Rycroft requesting him, as (it was stated) Mrs. de Carrey was really acting as the nominee of the syndicate, to insert a new clause in the agreement giving her the right to cede and transfer all her rights in the option to the Pauline Syndicate on the condition that the syndicate should assume all the rights and obligations to the appellants under the agreement. And on the following day Rycroft wrote to the solicitors a letter containing the following passage:

> “I beg to say that it was understood at the time of making the agreement with Mrs. de Carrey that she and the original (or parent) syndicate were one and the same, therefore I could not have any objection to the Pauline Colliery and Developing Syndicate being substituted under section 4 of your letter of the 8th *124 instant (Mrs. de Carrey's consent to the alteration, you assure me, has been obtained) for Mrs. de Carrey.”

At this time Rycroft was not aware of the assignment to Louch which had already been made by Mrs. de Carrey by the agreement of December 22, 1897, and he did not know what was the constitution of the so-called syndicate, or who were the persons who composed it, or what person he had agreed to substitute for Mrs. de Carrey. Their Lordships, however, will assume that the substitution was within his powers. The respondent company was not incorporated until January 22, 1898, on which date it was registered as a joint stock company with limited liability at Pretoria under the laws of the late South African Republic. The 100l. payable under the agreement was paid to Rycroft by the unincorporated syndicate before the incorporation of the respondent company. This sum was subsequently (on November 25, 1898) repaid by Rycroft to one Thurston by the order of Mrs. de Carrey.

On January 31, 1898, Rycroft wrote to the solicitors of Mrs. de Carrey and the syndicate a letter containing a copy of a telegram which (he says) he had that morning received from the appellants' London office. The telegram was as follows:—

> “Umhlali matter was not in accordance with instructions. Do nothing further. Inform Binns must wait board's orders.”

Binns was a member of the firm of Shepstone, Wylie & Binns, the solicitors for Mrs. de Carrey, the unincorporated syndicate, and the respondent company. Rycroft's comment on this telegram in his letter was:

> “I do not know what particular part of our negotiations this may refer to; but if anything more is required of me by the Pauline Syndicate or Mrs. de Carrey, I am bound by these instructions to await orders from the board.”

Their Lordships are of opinion that after this date Rycroft had no authority to make a new agreement or to vary the existing agreement, or in any other way to bind the appellants in the matter.

The term was extended to September 30, 1898, as provided in the agreement. The respondents had been engaged in boring for coal on an adjoining property, and did not prospect *125 or bore for coal on the property of the appellants till shortly before the expiration of the extended term, and very little work appears to have been done. But on September 15, 1898, the secretary of the respondents, by a letter of that date, informed Rycroft that his board was given to understand that his syndicate had struck a 3 ft. 8 in. seam of coal on the appellants' property at a depth of 293 feet, and claimed a lease to the respondents on terms of the correspondence between Rycroft and Messrs. Shepstone, Wylie & Binns, which they alleged constituted an agreement between the appellants and the respondents. Rycroft on the same day answered the letter, stating that he should send a copy of it to the London secretary of his company to be laid before the board for their instructions. On December 12, 1898, Rycroft, acting under the instructions of the appellants' board, declined to entertain the claim, but offered to consider an application for a lease at the same rent and royalties, but subject to certain conditions. This offer was not accepted.

On May 30, 1899, the respondents commenced the present action against the appellants for specific performance of the agreement contained in the seven letters dated November 30 to December 9, 1897, or in the alternative for damages. In their declaration the respondents alleged that on December 22, 1897, they acquired all the interest of Mrs. de Carrey in the agreement, but did not allege any other assignment to them or title to the benefit of the agreement.

The appellants in their plea to the declaration averred that there was no contract between the respondents and themselves, and alleged that the agreement to substitute the syndicate for Mrs. de Carrey was obtained from Rycroft by misrepresentation, the misrepresentation charged being that Mr. Binns and Louch had represented that Mrs. de Carrey had been acting for the syndicate all through the negotiations, whereas the syndicate or Louch had purchased the benefit of the agreement from her for a large sum.

The Court, consisting of Finnemore J. and Mr. Acting Justice Beaumont, decided in favour of the respondents on both points, and by their judgment of May 29, 1902, decreed specific *126 performance of the agreement with costs. On the question of privity of contract, they seem to have held that a new contract on the terms of the old one had been made between the appellants and the respondents. The acts of part performance which were relied on by the learned judges as evidence of such new contract were the occupation and working of the land in question by the respondents, the expenditure of money on the faith of the agreement, and the acceptance by the appellants of the payment of 100l. as a guarantee for prospecting operations. This sum, however (as already stated), was in fact paid before the incorporation of the respondents.

Their Lordships do not think it necessary to say whether the agreement was or was not voidable on the grounds alleged, or on other grounds appearing in the correspondence, because they are clearly of opinion that there was no contract between the appellants and the respondents. The contract was made with Mrs. de Carrey, and even if she can be treated as having made it on behalf either of the unincorporated syndicate, who were the promoters of the respondent company, or on behalf of the company itself when incorporated, it is clear that a company cannot by adoption or ratification obtain the benefit of a contract purporting to have been made on its behalf before the company came into existence. It is unnecessary to cite all the cases in which this has been decided from _Kelner v. Baxter_ [1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0A5C5920E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad740360000017dd7ad292f5f9be7ee&transitionType=SearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=79c25b082451ad69effa67908ea99cd0&list=RESEARCH_COMBINED_WLUK&rank=1&comp=wluk&navId=5F8B72F2EA3E4E2429D747A91A34816C&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#co_footnote_1) downwards. But the facts may show that a new contract was made with the company after its incorporation on the terms of the old contract. The circumstances relied on for that purpose in the present case are not, in the opinion of their Lordships, necessarily referable to, and do not necessarily imply, a new contract with the respondents. But a conclusive reason which negatives any new contract is that Rycroft, by whose agency the new contract must be supposed to have been made, had no power or authority after January 31, 1898, to make such a contract on behalf of the appellants, and his want of authority was known to the solicitors acting for the respondents. He was not either the actual or the ostensible agent for that purpose of the appellants.

*127

Their Lordships will, therefore, humbly advise His Majesty that the judgment of May 29, 1902, ought to be reversed, and that instead thereof judgment ought to be given for the defendants in the action with costs. The respondents will also pay the costs of this appeal.
