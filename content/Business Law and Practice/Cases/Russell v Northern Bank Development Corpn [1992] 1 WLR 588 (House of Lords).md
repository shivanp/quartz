# Russell v Northern Bank Development Corpn [1992] 1 WLR 588 (House of Lords)

TBL was a company which was set up with five shareholders, which comprised the bank and four executives (including R). The shareholders and the company entered into a shareholders' agreement, which provided that no further share capital would be created or issued without the consent of all of the parties. Several years later, the Board of directors proposed to make an increase of capital to Â£4 million by a rights issue of shares. R objected to this. The court made a declaration that the agreement was binding on the shareholders (although not on the company itself).

Note that the company had also originally agreed to be party by the shareholder agreement. But the company had tried to fetter its statutory right under CA 2006, and so it cannot be bound by this. So the company was cut out of the shareholders' agreement, but the rest of the Shareholders Agreement was still binding.
