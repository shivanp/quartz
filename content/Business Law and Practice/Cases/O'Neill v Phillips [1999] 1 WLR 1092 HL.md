# O'Neill v Phillips [1999] 1 WLR 1092 HL

#key-case

The petitioner, O, was employed by the company, whose sole director and shareholder was originally P.

P was impressed with O's work and in 1985 O was awarded 25% of the company's shares and made a director. P told O that he would eventually take over the business and would then receive 50% of the profits. In December 1985 P retired from the board and O became the sole director.

The business initially did well but then began to decline. In August 1991, P used his majority voting rights to appoint himself managing director and took over management of the business, telling O that he would no longer receive 50% of the profits, or receive certain share incentives. O issued a petition for unfair prejudice based on a legitimate expectation of receiving 50% of the voting shares.

The House of Lords held that there was no unfair prejudice here as the entitlement to 50% of the profits was never formalised and was conditional on O running the business, which he was no longer doing.

Hoffmann LJ in **_O'Neill v Phillips_** stated that fairness for the purposes of s 994 must be viewed in the context of a commercial relationship and that the relationship between the shareholders and the company is set out in the articles, which must be the starting point when determining whether conduct was unfair.

Westlaw

P, the sole director and shareholder of a company, appealed against a decision allowing an appeal ([1997] 2 B.C.L.C. 739, [1997] C.L.Y. 841) against a decision dismissing O's petition under the Companies Act 1985 s.459(1) that the company's affairs were being conducted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to O's interests as a minority shareholder. O contended that he and P had agreed that O would receive 50 per cent of the net profits in return for assuming day to day management of the company. During a period of recession, P became concerned about O's management skills and decided to resume control. P advised O that he would no longer receive 50 per cent of the profits. O contended that P had not given him further shares as agreed and had ended his entitlement to receive 50 per cent of the net profits. O argued that trust and confidence had broken down and further unfairness resulted from the fact that P was preventing O from recovering his interest in the company by refusing to purchase his shares.

Held, allowing the appeal, that unfairness had not been established in the absence of a breach of an agreed term. P had not agreed that O would be entitled to a 50 per cent profit share indefinitely, but only as long as O remained as managing director. As majority shareholder, P had the right to redetermine O's duties and salary structure. He had made no previous agreement with O capable of fettering those rights. Neither was there any agreement that O would receive more shares. Any unfairness was not suffered in O's capacity as shareholder, but rather as an employee and could not therefore satisfy the requirements of s.459(1), which was based on two basic tenets. Firstly, that management was regulated by the rules agreed by the shareholders, so that a member could not complain of unfairness without a breach of those rules. Secondly, company law had developed from partnership law which equity regarded as a contract of good faith, such that company members could be prevented from relying on their strict legal rights where they offended against equity. The concept of unfairness for the purposes of s.459 was based upon the dicta relating to the concept of "just and equitable" in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] A.C. 360, [1972] 5 WLUK 13. Members were not entitled to require the purchase of their shares solely because the mutual relationship of trust and confidence had broken down.

## Case Notes

Pectel Ltd. operated in the construction industry, providing specialist services for stripping asbestos from buildings. Mr O'Neill was employed as a manual worker. Mr Phillips, an accountant, in 1983 held the entire issued share capital of 100 £1 shares. Mr Phillips rapidly promoted Mr O'Neill to foreman, site supervisor and contracts manager. January 1985 gave him 25 shares and appointed him a director. May 1985: informal discussion where Mr Phillips expressed the hope that Mr O'Neill would be able to take over fully the day-to-day running of the company. On that basis, would be allowed to draw 50% of the company's profits.

Did take over running of business, Dec 1985 Mr Phillips retired from the board, effectively leaving him as managing director. Mr Phillips would waive $\frac{1}{3}$ of his 75% entitlement to produce equality. Mr O'Neill guaranteed the company's bank account and mortgaged house to support this guarantee.

Discussions and consultations were started about increasing Mr O'Neill's shareholding to 50%. Then the negotiations stopped. In 1991 construction boom came to an end and industry went into recession. Mr Phillips alarmed at financial position and concerned about management. August 1991 as controlling shareholder, resumed personal command. Mr O'Neill would manage the German branch, Mr Phillips would be managing director.

Nov 1991: Mr Phillips forcefully told Mr O'Neill he would only get salary and 25% of dividends moving forward. Mr O'Neill subsequently gave notice to terminate his guarantee of the bank account, made arrangements to set up a competing business in Germany.

Dec 1991: letter before action, saying Mr Phillips had broken his promises to pay Mr O'Neill 50% of the profits. Sought to dissolve partnership and claim damages, and brought a petition.

### The Petition

Two complaints:

1. Mr Phillip's termination of equal profit sharing
2. Repudiation of the alleged agreement for the allotment of more shares

Both rejected and petition dismissed. Two reasons for this:

1. Failed on facts: Mr Phillips had not committed himself permanently and unconditionally to an equal sharing of profits. Had made no promises about the additional shares.
2. The prejudice to Mr O'Neill's interests from the reduction in his profit-share and refusal to give him more shares was not suffered in his capacity as a shareholder. Profit share was his remuneration for acting as managing director, and the additional shares were a reward/ incentive.

### Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal subsequently ordered Mr Phillips to buy Mr O'Neill's shares. Held that Mr O'Neill had a legitimate expectation that he would receive more shares when the targets were reached, and of receiving 50%. Held that it would be unfairly prejudicial of Mr Phillips to deny these expectations, without giving Mr O'Neill notice or an opportunity to defend himself, or offering to buy shares at fair value. Found that Mr O'Neill had been “forced out of the company”.

Petition judge's second reason rejected: must take a broad view of the interests of a member, which were not necessarily limited to his strict legal rights. So a member who subscribed for shares on the understanding that he would take part in the management of the company might have an interest as a member in his continuing participation, thought this was not a right attached to his shares under the articles of the company.

Nourse L.J. said no other relevant capacity in which the unfair prejudice of which Mr O'Neill complained could have been suffered.

### Unfairly Prejudicial

Fairness chosen as the grounds by which the court must decide whether it has jurisdiction to grant relief. This was chosen to free the court from technical considerations of legal rights, and confer a wide power to do what it considered just and equitable. But fairness must be applied judicially and upon rational principles. As Warner J. said in In re J. E. Cade & Son Ltd. [1992] B.C.L.C. 213, 227: “The court… has a very wide discretion, but it does not sit under a palm tree.”

Content of 'fairness' is context-dependent: conduct fair between competing business may not be fair between members of a family. The manner in which the affairs of a company may be conducted is closely regulated by rules to which the shareholders have agreed. Company law has developed seamlessly from the law of partnership, which was treated by equity as a contract of good faith. One of the traditional roles of equity is to restrain the exercise of strict legal rights where contrary to good faith: these principles have carried over to company law.

So unfairness may consist in a breach of the rules or in using the rules in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to good faith.

Lord Wilberforce in [[Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] AC 360 HL]]:

> “The words ['just and equitable'] are a recognition of the fact that a limited company is more than a mere legal entity, with a personality in law of its own: that there is room in company law for recognition of the fact that behind it, or amongst it, there are individuals, with rights, expectations and obligations inter se which are not necessarily submerged in the company structure. That structure is defined by the Companies Act [1948] and by the articles of association by which shareholders agree to be bound. In most companies and in most contexts, this definition is sufficient and exhaustive, equally so whether the company is large or small. The 'just and equitable' provision does not, as the respondents [the company] suggest, entitle one party to disregard the obligation he assumes by entering a company, nor the court to dispense him from it. It does, as equity always does, enable the court to subject the exercise of legal rights to equitable considerations; considerations, that is, of a personal character arising between one individual and another, which may make it unjust, or inequitable, to insist on legal rights, or to exercise them in a particular way.”

A balance has to be struck between the breadth of discretion given to the court and the principle of legal certainty.

May be promises which it would be unfair to allow a member to ignore. Not necessary that such promises should be independently enforceable as a matter of contract: a promise may be binding as a matter of justice and equity, but not enforceable by law (e.g., because it would be unfair to a third party). The analogy is that of contractual frustration.

The unfairness may arise not from what the parties have positively agreed but from a majority using its legal powers to maintain the association in circumstances to which the minority can reasonably say it did not agree: non haec in foedera veni. It is well recognised that in such a case there would be power to wind up the company on the just and equitable ground (see _Virdi v. Abbey Leisure Ltd._ [1990] B.C.L.C. 342) and it seems to me that, in the absence of a winding up, it could equally be said to come within section 459. But this form of unfairness is also based upon established equitable principles and it does not arise in this case.

### Legitimate Expectation

A label for the right which may arise where it would be regarded as unfair for a majority to exercise a power conferred upon them by the articles to the prejudice of another member. This is a consequence, not a cause, of the equitable restraint.

### Was Mr Phillips Unfair?

It would have been unfair of Mr. Phillips to use his voting powers under the articles to remove Mr. O'Neill from participation in the conduct of the business without giving him the opportunity to sell his interest in the company at a fair price. Initially: Mr O'Neill was just an employee who happened to have been given some shares. But over the following years, the relationship changed. _In re H. R. Harmer_ [1959] 1 W.L.R. 62 shows that shareholders who receive their shares as a gift but afterwards work in the business may become entitled to enforce equitable restraints upon the conduct of the majority shareholder.

But Mr Philliips did not remove Mr O'Neill from participation in management of the business. Mr Phillips never agreed to give Mr O'Neill shares: made no promise on the point. So, no basis for a court to hold that Mr Phillips was behaving unfairly in withdrawing from the negotiation: to do so would be imposing upon Mr Phillips an obligation to which he never agreed.

Similar with sharing of profits: no unconditional promise was made. Mr Phillips deliberately retained control of the company and the right to redraw Mr O'Neill's responsibilities.

So NO BASIS for Court of Appeal's finding that Mr O'Neill had been driven out of the company.

### No-fault Divorce

Mr O'Neill's defence argued that it did not matter whether Mr Phillips had done anything unfair; trust and confidence had broken down. So would be unfair to leave Mr O'Neill locked into the company as a minority shareholder. So claimed that all he needed to do was to show that trust and confidence had broken down.

No support for such a stark right of unilateral withdrawal. One should not press the quasi-partnership analogy too far.

### Capacity in Which Prejudice Suffered

Could well have changed the capacity in which Mr O'Neill suffered prejudice once he had invested his own money and effort in the company. But did not suffer prejudice, so the point does not arise.

### Offer to Buy

The offer to buy the shares at fair price does not need to be considered. But important point to rule on anyway.

An offer was made by Mr Phillips, but it made no provision for Mr O'Neill's costs, so was rejected. Court of Appeal held that Mr O'Neill justified in rejecting it since it did not provide for his costs, This was right.

In the present case, Mr. Phillips fought the petition to the end and your Lordships have decided that he was justified in doing so. But I think that parties ought to be encouraged, where at all possible, to avoid the expense of money and spirit inevitably involved in such litigation (See Shakespeare, Sonnet 129) by making an offer to purchase at an early stage.

Usually, the majority shareholder will want to put an end to the association. In such a case, it will almost always be unfair for the minority shareholder to be excluded without an offer to buy his shares or make some other fair arrangement. Here unfairness does not lie in exclusion alone, but in exclusion without reasonable offer.

Here, reasonable means

- Purchasing shares at fair value
- Ordinarily this will be a value representing an equivalent proportion of the total issued share capital, without a discount for it being a minority holding.
- Value, if not agreed, should be determined by a competent expert (acting as an expert and not thinking about political/judicial considerations)
- Offer should provide for equity of arms (both should have same right of access to information about the company)
- The majority shareholder should have a reasonable time to make the offer before conduct is treated as unfair.
