# Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd [2004]

## Summary

The question whether a particular transaction was within the ordinary course of a company's business in the context of a floating charge was a mixed question of fact and law. The first step was to ascertain as a matter of fact whether an objective observer with knowledge of the company, its memorandum of association and its business would view the transaction as having taken place in the ordinary course of its business. If so, the second step was to consider whether, on the proper interpretation of the document creating the floating charge, the parties nonetheless did not intend that the transaction should be regarded as being in the ordinary course of the company's business for the purpose of the charge.

## Abstract

The claimants (X) brought proceedings against the defendant group of companies (G) for declarations as to the ownership of various petroleum licences and shares. G held several licences that had been charged to a lender by the creation of debentures, pursuant to a financing agreement. The agreement expressly provided that G could dispose of assets in the ordinary course of its business. G later acquired four further licences, and transferred interests in various licences to third parties. After G went into administrative receivership X agreed to purchase G's interests in the licences and the shares. In its claim, X argued that the debentures had created a fixed charge over the licences, including those acquired subsequently, and over the shares, so that G was not entitled to make transfers free from the charge. G contended that it had only created a floating charge.

Held, granting the declaration in part, that

(1) the debentures had not created a fixed charge over the licences or the shares. A chargor's unfettered freedom to deal with the assets in the ordinary course of business was inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge, _[Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd, Re [1998] Ch. 495, [1997] 7 WLUK 598](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/I8EDAC390E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=824ca5f9ad9143dfb21f889cc8c7aa82&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. Although the fact that certain assets were not circulating capital or stock in trade that was for sale in the ordinary course of business could be important in categorising a charge as a fixed charge in an appropriate case, this was less relevant where disposal in the ordinary course of business was permitted by an express provision. The security created by the debentures was an equitable assignment rather than a legal assignment, and was consistent with a floating charge over the assets.

(2) Whether a particular transaction was within the ordinary course of business in the context of a floating charge was a question of fact and law that had to be determined by a two stage test; the first part being to ascertain whether an objective observer, knowing the company and its memorandum of association, would view the transaction as being in the ordinary course of its business, if so, it then had to be considered whether the document that created the floating charge showed that the parties had not intended the transaction to be so regarded for the purposes of the charge.
