# Hely-Hutchinson v Brayhead Ltd [1968] 1 QB 549

#key-case

Mr Richards was the chairman and chief executive of the defendant company. He had agreed with the claimant (MD of another company which planned to merge with the defendant company) that the defendant company would guarantee repayment of loans and indemnify the claimant against losses. The defendant company argued that Richards did not have authority to do this and therefore the company was not bound. Despite having no express authority, the Court of Appeal held that he had implied actual authority from a course of dealing due to his conduct over many months of entering into similar contracts and later notifying the board, who never objected.

## Facts

Anthony James Richards was chairman of defendant company Brayhead and acted as de facto managing director - was chief executive with final say on all finance matters. Often committed B. to contracts without board knowledge, and let them know afterwards. Board knew and acquisced.

July 1964: plaintiff (Richard Michael John Hely-Hutchinson, or Viscount Suirdale), who was chairman and managing director of Perdio Electronics Ltd. gave personal guarantee to bankers for a loan of £50,000 to Perdio. After a few months Perdio sustaining losses. Brayhead willing to help with intention to eventually obtain control of Perdio.

Jan 1965: Brayhead bought 750,000 Perdio shares for >£100,000 and proposed also injecting £150,000. Plaintiff became a director of Brayhead (though did not attend board meetings until 19th May 1965).

At that meeting: plaintiff agreed to put more money into Perdio if Brayhead secured his position. So Richard, on Brayhead's behalf, signed two letters on Brayhead paper adressed to the plaintiff:

- First purported to indemnify Suirdale against loss of personal income of £50,000
- Brayhead purported to guarantee to repay money lent by plaintiff personally to Perdio  
So plaintiff advanced £45,000 to Perdio.

Brayhead's articles of association allowed director to enter into such contracts, provided a disclosure was made to the board. Note plaintiff Suirdale never read or saw a copy of memorandum or articles of association of Brayhead . Then Perdio went bust. Plaintiff paid bankers £50,000 and claimed that, plus 45k lent to Perdio, from Brayhead.

Brayhead denied liability, saying

1. Richard had no authority to sign letters (neither actual nor ostensible and apparent),
2. If there was ostensible/ apparent authority upon which stranger/ third party could rely under [[Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E & B 327]] rule, Lord Suirdale was at all times director of Brayhead so must be treated for all purposes as having put on notice.
3. Turquand's rule cases have no present application since transaction in question not 'usual' transactions, since by entering into them, Lord Suirdale had acted in breach of obligations and duties under Art 99 and/or s199 CA 1948
4. Since the plaintiff had not disclosed his interest in the contracts as required by B.'s articles of association and s199 Companies Act 1948, contracts unenforceable (both Lord Suirdale and Brayhead had no contracual capacity, or at least Lord Suirdale had no contractual capacity)

Held:

- Richard had ostensible or apparent authority to enter into contracts
- Breach of Art 99 of B.'s articles of association and s199 of CA 1948 only rendered contracts voidable (at the instance of the company), not void and unenforceable, so plaintiff was entitled to recover.

Then after appeal: held that Richard had **actual** authority to be implied from the conduct of the parties and circumstances of case, to enter into the two contracts.

ROSKILL J.

Lord Suirdale was acting as an individual when agreeing to advance the money to Perdio, which

>"had nothing to do with his duties and obligations as a director of Brayhead".

Not an 'unusual' transaction in the commercial sense.

On the question of article 99, plaintiff took proposition that (while not illegal) it was unenforceable because void or voidable, or because in either or both parties a want of capacity to contract.

Note that there is no rule of common law that a director could not validly contract with a company of which he is a director. But equity ensured company could when appropriate recover any profit made by director as a result of such a contract made by director.

>"I do not think there is more than a verbal difference between saying that the contract is unenforceable by the director and saying that it is voidable by the company."  
>Lord Pearson
