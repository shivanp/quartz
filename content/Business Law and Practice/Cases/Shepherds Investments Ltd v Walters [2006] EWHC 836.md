# Shepherds Investments Ltd v Walters [2006] EWHC 836

In this case, the former directors of Shepherds were found liable for breach of duty where they had set up rival companies prior to resigning from Shepherds, without disclosing their intentions to the board of Shepherds.

The court found that their activity was a breach of their fiduciary duty of good faith and put them in a position of conflict. They were held liable to account for the profits generated during the “advance start” period that their breach had given them, but not liable for damages as no loss to Shepherds was proved to have been caused by the breach.
