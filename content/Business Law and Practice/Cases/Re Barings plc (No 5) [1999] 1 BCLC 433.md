# Re Barings plc (No 5) [1999] 1 BCLC 433

In this case, proceedings were brought under the CDDA for the disqualification of directors of Barings Bank following huge losses resulting from the unauthorised dealings of a trader, Nick Leeson, who was based in the bank's Singapore office.

One of the issues was the level of supervision that should be expected of a director who was the Deputy Chairman of the Barings Group, the Chairman of Barings Investment Bank and the Barings Investment Bank Managing Committee. The director argued that he was justified in trusting delegates until matters came to his attention that required his response.

The court held that the directors, collectively and individually, had a duty to acquire and maintain a sufficient knowledge of the company's business to enable them to discharge their responsibilities, and that the power to delegate did not absolve directors from the duty to supervise the way in which delegated functions are carried out.
