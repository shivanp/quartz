# Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821

The facts were that rival takeover offers for all the shares in a company, RW Miller (Holdings) Ltd, had been submitted by Howard Smith Ltd and Ampol Ltd. Ampol already held 55% of the shares (together with an associated company) so there was no prospect that Howard Smith's offer would succeed. However, a majority of Miller's directors preferred Howard Smith's offer as the terms were more favourable, and therefore they resolved to issue $10 million of new shares to Howard Smith in order to defeat Ampol's takeover offer.

The Privy Council held that the new share issue, despite being within the powers of the directors, was unlawful as it was not in accordance with the proper purposes doctrine, since the primary purpose of the share issue was not to raise capital but to frustrate Ampol's takeover offer.

As per Wilberforce LJ:

>“Just as it is established that directors, within their management powers, may take decisions against the wishes of the majority of shareholders, and indeed that the majority of shareholders cannot control them in the exercise of these powers while they remain in office … so it must be unconstitutional for directors to use their fiduciary powers over the shares in the company purely for the purpose of destroying an existing majority, or creating a new majority which did not previously exist.”

Directors abuse their fiduciary powers by authorising the issue of shares for the purpose of altering the voting power in the company, and such issue is invalid. A and B held a majority holding of the issued share capital of the M company. A's take-over offer for M's issued shares was bettered by an offer by H. The directors of M recommended rejection of A's offer and favoured acceptance of H's offer, but A and B subsequently announced their joint intention to reject any offer from H or anyone else. M's directors were empowered to allot unissued share capital on such terms as they thought fit and resolved to issue sufficient shares to H to reduce A's and B's joint holding to a minority; the number of and premium upon such shares was calculated according to M's current capital requirements, and the shares were duly issued. H appealed against an order setting aside the issue.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that, although the directors had not been motivated by self-interest in allotting the shares the court would look to the substantial purpose for issuing the shares and where as here such purpose was solely to dilute the voting power of A and B, the directors had abused their fiduciary powers in making the issue for a purpose unconnected with management or other proper considerations.
