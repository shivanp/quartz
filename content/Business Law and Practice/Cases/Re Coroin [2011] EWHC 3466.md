# Re Coroin [2011] EWHC 3466

## Abstract

The court was required to determine whether the sale of a company (M), which held shares in another company (C), had triggered pre-emption provisions contained in C's articles of association and a shareholders' agreement.

The pre-emption provisions restricted the transfer of shares in C or any interest in those shares. A group of companies (B) had sought to take control of C and, to that end, bought M, which was one of C's shareholders. Consequently, another of C's shareholders (K) presented a petition under the Companies Act 2006 s.994 and brought an associated action claiming that B's purchase of M breached the pre-emption provisions.

## Held

Judgment accordingly.

As the right to deal freely with a share was an important attribute of ownership and the prima facie right of a shareholder, the existence and extent of any restriction on transfer, such as pre-emption provisions, had to be clearly stated, Smith & Fawcett, Re [1942] Ch. 304, [1942] 3 WLUK 51 and Greenhalgh v Mallard [1943] 2 All E.R. 234, [1943] 5 WLUK 30 applied.

There were insuperable difficulties in construing the interest referred to in the pre-emption provisions as including the type of indirect interest in the shares held by M which was enjoyed by the owner of M's share capital, such that a sale of that share capital therefore triggered an obligation to give a transfer notice or gave rise to a deemed transfer notice under the provisions. There was no ambiguity in the definition of a shareholder in the pre-emption provisions. The references there to an interest in the shares were to direct proprietary interests in the shares. The provisions applied only where a shareholder had attempted to deal with shares or any interest in shares, and deemed the shareholder to have given a transfer notice. They permitted each corporate shareholder to transfer the entire legal and beneficial interest in shares held by it. Further, the absence of a clear statement that a disposal of M would trigger the pre-emption procedure in what were complex provisions covering many eventualities told against K's suggested construction. Thus, the registration by a shareholder of a transfer of the shares in itself did not constitute a transfer of interest in shares for the purposes of the agreement and articles.
