# Royal British Bank v Turquand (1856) 6 E & B 327

The bank brought a claim for the return of money owed by the company. The company argued that the manager who negotiated the loan should have been authorised by a resolution of the shareholders to enter into the loan, and as he had not obtained this authorisation, the loan was void and the company not required to pay back the money. The doctrine of constructive notice would mean that the bank was deemed to know of the requirement for authorisation in the company's constitution. The court held that as the public documents would only reveal that a resolution was required and not whether such a resolution had been passed, the loan was valid. The principle stated was that outsiders are entitled to assume that the company's internal procedures have been complied with. This is often referred to as the 'indoor management' rule.
