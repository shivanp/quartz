# Franbar Holdings Ltd v Patel [2008] EWHC 1534

## Facts:

In the present case, Medicentres was a company established to provide primary health care and medical service. The company was wholly owned by Franbar until July 2005. At that time, Franbar sold 75% of the shares it owned in Medicentres to Casualty Plus. Then, Franbar and Casualty Plus entered into a shareholders’ agreement. According to this agreement, Casualty Plus appointed two directors to Medicentres and Franbar appointed one.

Franbar brought derivative proceedings against Casualty Plus and Medicentres, claiming various breaches of duty of care. In particular, it argued that one of the directors, Mr Ketam Patel, reduced the cost Medicentres’ shares by driving business away from it.

## Issue:

Continuation of the derivative claim.

## Held:

The court dismissed Franbar’s application for permission to continue the derivative action. The court noted that there was substance in Franbar’s complaint that could give rise to breaches of duty by Mr Ketam Patel. However, Franbar’s motive to continue derivative proceedings was to ensure that the value of its shares in Medicentres was full and fair. The court held that there were alternative modes of redress that would enable Franbar to claim what it was seeking.

Thus, in these circumstances, the appropriate remedy for the applicant would be an action under Section 994 of the Companies Act 2006 (protection of members of company against unfair prejudice).
