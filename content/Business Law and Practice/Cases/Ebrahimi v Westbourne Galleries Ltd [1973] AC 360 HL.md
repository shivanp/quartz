# Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] AC 360 HL

This case concerned a rug business which had been run by E and N as a partnership for over a decade.

In 1958 a company was established to take over the business and initially E and N were the only directors and equal shareholders. N's son then joined the company as a director and shareholder, meaning that E became a minority at both board and shareholder level. The parties fell out and E was voted off the board but retained his shares. No dividends were paid to him, as all the profits were distributed by way of directors' remuneration.

E petitioned the court for a winding up order under s 122(1)(g) IA 1986 and alternatively for relief under the “oppression remedy” in the Companies Act 1948, which was the precursor to the unfair prejudice remedy. The House of Lords concluded that although E had been validly removed as a director under the Companies Act, the company had been formed on the understanding that E would remain in management. His exclusion was in breach of that understanding, and therefore it was just and equitable to wind up the company. This company was held to be a “quasi-partnership”.
