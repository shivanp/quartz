# Teck Corporation v Millar (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288

This case explored the overlap between the old duty of good faith (now s 172) and the proper purposes doctrine.

The court held that directors may be entitled to use their powers to protect the company if on reasonable grounds the proposed takeover will cause substantial damage to the company. Here, the takeover would be a bad deal for the shareholders. The power of directors to issue shares may be exercised for reasons other than the raising of capital, provided those reasons relate to a purpose benefiting the company as a whole.

The proper purposes doctrine encapsulated in s171 is an incident of the central fiduciary duty of directors to promote the success of the company.
