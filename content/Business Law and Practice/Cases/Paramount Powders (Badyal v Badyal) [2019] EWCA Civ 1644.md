# Paramount Powders (Badyal v Badyal) [2019] EWCA Civ 1644

Over the course of this litigation, the eldest brother (B1) who held 25% shares in a family company failed with three claims:

**Unfair prejudice – s 994 CA 2006**

B1’s exclusion from management and dismissal as a director was justified and not unfair because B1 was in breach of s172 and s 175 CA 2006 by directly competing against the company through his son’s company (Trident) without consent of his fellow directors. There was no unfair prejudice remedy.

**Just and equitable winding up – s 122(1)(g) IA 1986**

The petition to wind up on ground of failure of mutual trust and confidence between B1 and the other directors failed because B1 competed with the company in breach of his duties. B1 was the sole cause of the break-down of trust and such lack of probity and good faith meant he came to equity without clean hands so winding up (an exceptional remedy in any event) was not available. The petition was also refused as it would “leave the field clear for Trident”.

**Derivative claim – s 260 CA 2006**

B1 claimed that brother 2 had breached his duty as a director to the company by setting up a competitor company but the claim failed as B1 had consented.
