# The Commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs v Holland (2010)

The Supreme Court in this case reviewed the case law on de facto directorships. In this case Mr Holland (H) was a de jure director of a Company A which was itself a corporate director of Company B. The question was whether H should be considered to be a de facto director of Company B and therefore whether H owed fiduciary duties to Company B. The court held that the basis of liability for a de facto director is an assumption of liability together with his being a part of a companyâ€™s corporate governance structure. In this case H was not held to be a de facto director of Company B as the acts he undertook were within the scope of his duties and responsibilities as a director of Company A.
