# Loch v John Blackwood Ltd [1924] AC 783, PC

The majority shareholder in this company dominated the board of directors, refused to declare dividends, call general meetings or publish accounts, aiming to induce the minority shareholders to sell their shares at an undervalue. The Privy Council ordered the company to be wound up.
