# Re Chesterfield Catering Co [1977] Ch 373

Where a member of a company petitions for its winding up, he must show that it is likely that some advantage will accrue to him from the winding up as a member, and not merely privately.

The petitioners were the personal representatives of a man who had been sole director, and owner, of 49 out of 100 shares, in a company. The other shareholders had no interest in the petition. The company had ceased to trade and was insolvent. No advantage would accrue to the estate from the winding up.

Held, that the petitioners had no locus standi to make the application. They had no sufficient interest in the winding up, since it was unlikely that there would be any benefit to the estate arising from it. ([[Re Rica Gold Washing Co (1879) 40 LT 531, CA]] applied and [[Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] AC 360 HL]] distinguished).
