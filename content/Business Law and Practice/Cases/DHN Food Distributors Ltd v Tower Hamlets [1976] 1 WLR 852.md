# DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets [1976] 1 WLR 852

The business was owned by DHN and the land upon which the business was operated was owned by a wholly owned subsidiary, Bronze. The Council acquired land owned by Bronze on which DHN operated its cash and carry warehouse. The Council submitted that while Bronze was entitled to compensation for loss of market value, DHN was not entitled to disturbance loss because it did not have any interest in the land, either legal or equitable. DHN was a licensee only.

Section 20 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 provided that if a person had no greater interest than a tenant from year to year in the land, then that person was only entitled to compensation for that lesser interest.  

Held: The Court combined the interests of a parent and its subsidiary for the assessment of compensation following a compulsory acquisition.

Lord Denning further observed that where a parent company owns all the shares of the subsidiaries, it can control their every movement. The subsidiaries are bound ‘hand and foot’ to the parent company and must do what the parent company says. He continued:

> ‘So here. This group is virtually the same as a partnership in which all the three companies are partners. They should not be treated separately so as to be defeated on a technical point. They should not be deprived of the compensation which should justly be payable for disturbance. The three companies should, for present purposes, be treated as one and the parent company, DHN, should be treated as that one.’
