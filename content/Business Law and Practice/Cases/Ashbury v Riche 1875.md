# Ashbury v Riche 1875

		   

Here, a company’s object clause stated its objects were to ‘make and sell, or lend and hire, railway-carriages’, but it subsequently entered into a contract to finance the construction of a railway line in Belgium. The company later attempted to repudiate the contract – and thus avoid a breach of contract – by claiming that it had been made ultra vires. The House of Lords agreed, holding that every act outside a company’s objects clause was ultra vires, rendering it null and void.
