# Re Continental Assurance Co of London plc [2001] BPIR 733

Re Continental Assurance Co of London plc [2007] 2 BCLC 287 (also, Singer v. Beckett) is a UK insolvency law case on wrongful trading under section 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

## Facts

Continental Assurance plc had gone into insolvent liquidation. The liquidators submitted that the directors were guilty of wrongful trading ([Insolvency Act 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency_Act_1986 "Insolvency Act 1986") section 214). They had continued to trade after a crisis meeting, which should have made clear there was no reasonable prospect of coming out of insolvency. The liquidators also alleged misfeasance (section 212) through years of disorganised financial and accounting records and this was what made it difficult to tell whether the company was insolvent. Furthermore, payments to two other companies, IATA and ABTA, showed misfeasance.

## Judgment

Park J held that the liquidators had failed to show a case of wrongful trading or misfeasance. The directors' action was appropriate given their available information and advice. They had made careful considerations at the crisis meeting.

Park J also held that if the liquidators were correct about misfeasance, it would only be the finance director that was liable, not the other directors. But the misfeasance claim was in respect of breach of directors' duties to Continental Assurance, and therefore a loss had to be shown. But the payments to IATA and ABTA had caused no loss.

### Summary

The former directors of an insolvent company were not liable in damages to the company's liquidators for wrongful trading or misfeasance, given that they were reasonable in their approach to the situation they found the company in and considered carefully the issue of whether the company should continue trading, and any misfeasance would have been on the part of the finance director alone and would not have been sufficient to give rise to the liquidators' claim.

### Abstract

The liquidators of C, an insurance company which had gone into insolvent liquidation, sought relief from C's former directors. They submitted that

(1) the directors were guilty of wrongful trading pursuant to the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.214](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID7108D71E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=177d3d2a81444b428c973fdf10dcf901&contextData=(sc.Default)) in that they had continued to trade after the holding of a crisis meeting, when they ought to have known that there was a reasonable prospect of C becoming insolvent;

(2) the directors were guilty of misfeasance in that, because of years of maintaining disorganised financial and accounting records, they had wrongly decided to continue to trade after the crisis meeting, given that it was impossible to tell from the records whether the company was solvent or not, and

(3) there was misfeasance in relation to two payments made to I and A, and therefore the directors were liable to the liquidators for the amount of such payments.

### Held

Judgment for defendants.

(1) the liquidators had not made out a case of wrongful trading. The actions of the directors were appropriate given the information and advice they had before them. They had been diligent in their approach to C's situation and their duties as directors from the time of the crisis meeting, and they had considered carefully the issue of whether C could continue to trade;

(2) if the liquidators had been correct in their assertion of misfeasance because of the state of the accounting records it would only have indicated misfeasance on the part of the finance director, and not on the part of the other directors. If there was misfeasance it could not be considered sufficient to establish the liquidators' claim, and

(3) the claim for misfeasance in respect of the payments was a claim for breach of the directors' duties to C, and therefore in order for the loss to be claimed it had to be suffered by C. However, the payments the directors had made to I and A had caused no loss to C.
