## Abstract

G appealed against part of a judgment refusing to order the set off against a debt owed to T, a company, against the amount owed to C. G had succeeded in an action for unfair prejudice under the [Companies Act 1985 s.459](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I954634D0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8d806112cea1478c85d1e5d067ea1540&contextData=(sc.Default)). G and C were equal shareholders in T. Without G's knowledge, C had misappropriated GBP 517,734 from T. Included in the sums taken from the company by C without authority were pension contributions totalling GBP 145,000 that C paid to his pension fund. The judge found that T was indebted to the pension fund in the sum of GBP 100,000. However, he refused to order that debt to be set off against the GBP 145,000.

G appealed, contending that where money subject to one express trust was paid improperly and without valuable consideration to the trustees of another trust, that money or its traceable proceeds still belonged in equity to the first trust and its trustees, who had a proprietary claim to recover them. Further, T could trace the contributions which C made to his pension fund without authority out of T's assets into the hands of the trustees and that T had an option whether to claim a proportionate share of the fund or a lien on its assets.

The remedy sought by T was a charge, and the most appropriate assets on which to impose this charge were the benefit of the loans from the pension fund trustees to T, and, as to any balance, the cash held by the pension fund trustees. Accordingly, G sought an order that the amounts recovered from the pension fund trustees should be credited against C's judgment debt.

Held, allowing the appeal, that where a director had taken money from the company without authority and paid it into his pension fund, the company was entitled to trace the payments into the pension fund assets and set them off against a debt owed by the company to the pension fund trustees. Thus, the amount owed to C by T under the pension fund could be set off against C's judgment debt. The payments made by C to the pension fund were void rather than voidable because he made them without authority as well as in breach of duty to the company, _[Guinness Plc v Saunders [1990] 2 A.C. 663, [1990] 2 WLUK 127](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB5A444B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8d806112cea1478c85d1e5d067ea1540&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.

Although the pension fund trustees received the payments without notice of the lack of authority, the payments were void and the trustees received them as constructive trustees because C had acted in breach of his fiduciary duty to the company, _[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC [1996] A.C. 669, [1996] 5 WLUK 343](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF83E7B00E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8d806112cea1478c85d1e5d067ea1540&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. Thus, T was entitled to trace the payments into the pension fund assets. Accordingly, it was considered that a charge over the pension fund assets to secure the GBP 145,000 was an appropriate way of giving effect to that proprietary remedy and that sum could then be set off against the GBP100,000 owed by T to the trustees. The fund remained liable for the balance.
