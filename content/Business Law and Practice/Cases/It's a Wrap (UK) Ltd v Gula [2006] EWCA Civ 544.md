# It's a Wrap (UK) Ltd v Gula [2006] EWCA Civ 544

In this case, the liquidator sought repayment of dividends paid to the defendants, who were the sole shareholders and directors of the company. Over a two-year period in which there were no profits available for distribution, the company's accounts showed that dividends had been paid to the defendants. The defendants argued that the sums received were actually remuneration but had been shown in the accounts as dividends as they had been advised that this was more tax efficient.

The Court of Appeal held that ignorance of the law was no defence, and that the defendants were liable to repay the money. Arden LJ stated that the shareholders would be liable

>“if [they] knew or ought reasonably to have known of the facts which mean that the distribution contravened the requirements of the Act”.
