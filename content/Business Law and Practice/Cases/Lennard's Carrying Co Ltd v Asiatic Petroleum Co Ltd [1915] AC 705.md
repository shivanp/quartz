# Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd [1915] AC 705

This case involved liability under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 which had a requirement of fault. Viscount Haldane LC concluded that it was necessary to identify an individual within the company who was the 'directing mind and will of the corporationâ€¦the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation'. Once that individual has been identified, if that person has the required fault then that fault can be attributed to the company.
