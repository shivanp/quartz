# Grace v Bigioli [2005] EWCA Civ 1222

**Facts:**

In the case of _Grace v Biagioli [2005]_, the appellant petitioner, Mr Grace, was one of four shareholders of the company. Each of the four shareholders was entitled to £20,000 in dividend relating to the financial year. Although, the company performed poorly. As a result, others withheld Mr Grace’s dividend. The appellant, in turn, began to explore the possibility of buying a competing company in the Far East. When the others discovered this, they removed him as a director. Mr Grace alleged this was unfairly prejudicial behaviour towards him.

**Issue:**

Whether the appellant’s dismissal was unfairly prejudicial?

**Held:**

The High Court and the Court of Appeal held that the dismissal was not unfairly prejudicial. In particular, negotiations to buy a rival company without any prior disclosure to or discussion with his fellow directors and shareholders and the appellant’s attempts to conceal the existence of the negotiations justified his dismissal.
