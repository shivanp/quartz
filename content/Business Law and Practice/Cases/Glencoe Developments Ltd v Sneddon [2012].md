# Glencoe Developments Ltd v Sneddon [2012]

Glencoe Developments Limited had two shareholders S and M. S sold one of her shares to H, creating, on the face of it, three shareholders. However, the transfer was not noted in the register of members. A general meeting was held to agree to sell a substantial property asset of the company. Only S and H were in attendance. A resolution was supposedly passed to transfer the company’s right, title and interest in land to one of the directors of the company. The resolution was then challenged by M on behalf of Glencoe Developments Ltd who raised a court action. M’s action was successful as (amongst other defects) a quorum had not been achieved by the parties. It was ruled that because the register of members had not been updated, the only properly registered shareholder present at the meeting was S. As a result, the sale was ruled invalid.
