# Re Tasbian Ltd (No 3) [1992] BCC 358

## **Facts:**

In the case of _Re Tasbian Ltd [1992]_, the appellant Mr Nixon, a chartered accountant and “company doctor” was appointed as a consultant to Tasbian Ltd. The appellant loaned Tasbian Ltd substantial sums of money. The company had never traded at a profit and had accumulated losses of nearly £1 million over a 3 year period by the time of Mr Nixon’s appointment. Subsequently, the company went into liquidation.

The UK Secretary of Trade argued that Mr Nixon became a shadow director and totally mismanaged the company. As a result, he should be disqualified from holding the office of director for up to 5 years and be subject to various other sanctions applicable only to directors.

Mr Nixon appealed. He claimed that there was no evidence to show that he acted as a shadow or de-facto director of Tasbian Ltd. So, the penalties did apply to him.

## **Issue:**

The issue was whether Mr Nixon was an independent outside consultant to Tasbian Ltd, or whether he had become a shadow or de facto director.

## **Held:**

Appeal dismissed. The Court of Appeal found that there was sufficient evidence to disclose a _prima-facie_ case that Mr Nixon had acted as a shadow or de facto director. In particular, the appellant was involved in making to the company’s creditors and in which order. To this extent, Mr Nixon controlled the company’s affairs. This raised an arguable case that the appellant acted either as a shadow or de facto director.
