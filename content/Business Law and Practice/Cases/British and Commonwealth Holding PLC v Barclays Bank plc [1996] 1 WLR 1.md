# British and Commonwealth Holding PLC v Barclays Bank plc [1996] 1 WLR 1

## Abstract

Caledonia Investments Ltd, CI, held 101,478,412 of the ordinary stock units in B&C but in 1987 decided to divest themselves of their interest. A scheme was drawn up whereby a million stock units were cancelled, partly by B&C buying some of the units for GBP 100 million, and partly by exchanging the remaining units for new redeemable preference shares in B&C. The new shares would be redeemed in four equal tranches, at a price of GBP 81 million, at the wish of either CI or B&C between 1988 and 1991. If B&C failed to redeem the shares CI would be granted the option to sell the tranches to a company, Tindalk Ltd, specially formed for the purpose and which was to be financed by the defendant's banks, BB. By 1990 B&C was held to be insolvent and CI exercised their option requiring Tindalk to purchase the third and fourth tranches, for which BB provided finance. The shares were of no value and so the banks were unlikely to recover their money. BB claimed damages for breach of contract and, inter alia, a declaration that B&C was liable to indemnify BB against loss and damage. B&C claimed that the action could not succeed because the [Companies Act 1985 s.178(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I91805331E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=044eea70137b45039d61fac57fa53e5f&contextData=(sc.Default)) provided that a company was not liable in damages in respect of any failure on its part to redeem or purchase any of its shares. B&C appealed against certain parts of answers given in a special case presented by the parties.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the damages claimed by BB were for breaches of contract for failure to comply with covenants and not for failure to redeem the shares. B&C argued that the option agreement constituted financial assistance by a company for the purchase of its shares, but the purpose of the option agreement was to reassure CI that they would receive their money in any event. The covenants were to guarantee performance and did not involve the provision of financial assistance.
