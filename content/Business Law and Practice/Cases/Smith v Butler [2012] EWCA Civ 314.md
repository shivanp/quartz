# Smith v Butler [2012] EWCA Civ 314

The court had to determine whether a managing director had implied power to suspend the company's executive chairman without express authorisation by the board. It was held that the implied powers of a managing director are those that would ordinarily be exercisable by a managing director in his position, subject to the company's articles and anything that the parties expressly agreed. The court considered that this did not include the suspension of the chairman.
