# Re Produce Marketing Consortium Ltd [1989] BCLC 513, ChD

This was the first reported case under s 214 IA 1986. The court held the two directors of the company each liable to contribute £75,000 to the company's assets. It was held that the time at which the directors ought to have realised that there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding insolvent liquidation was the latest possible date on which the annual accounts for that year ought to have been delivered. The fact that the directors had not seen the accounts was irrelevant, since s 214(4) required them to be judged not only on the facts actually known to them but on the facts that they should have known had the accounts been delivered in accordance with the Companies Act. The judge stated:

> “It follows that the general knowledge, skill and experience postulated will be much less extensive in a small company in a modest way of business, with simple accounting procedures and equipment, than it will be in a large company with sophisticated procedures. Nevertheless, certain minimum standards are to be assumed to be attained. Notably, there is an obligation laid on companies to cause accounting records to be kept which are such as to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company at that time.”
