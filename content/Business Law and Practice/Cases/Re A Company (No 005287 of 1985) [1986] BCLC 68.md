# Re A Company (No 005287 of 1985) [1986] BCLC 68

The petitioners, who were minority shareholders, alleged that the respondent, who was the majority shareholder, had disposed of the companyâ€™s assets in breach of his fiduciary duty to the company and in a manner which was unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the petitioner. Hoffmann J refused to strike out the petition, holding that the fact that the petitioners could have brought a derivative action did not prevent them seeking relief under s 459.
