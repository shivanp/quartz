# Cook v Deeks [1916] 1 AC 554 (Privy Council)

In this case, three of the four directors of the company fell out with the fourth director (Cook).

The company had negotiated a series of construction contracts with a railway company and had built up considerable goodwill. The three directors took the last contract in their own names rather than that of the company. Cook claimed that the company was entitled to the benefit of the contract and that a shareholders' resolution which the defendants had passed with their own votes to ratify that the company claimed no interest in the contract was ineffective.

The Privy Council agreed. Lord Buckmaster stated:

>“While entrusted with the conduct of the affairs of the company (the directors had) deliberately designed to exclude, and used their influence and position to exclude, the company whose interest it was their first duty to protect.”
