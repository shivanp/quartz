# Brown v La Trinidad (1887) 37 Ch. D. 1

A pre-incorporation agreement specified that Browne should become a director of a company for a specified length of time. The agreement later became part of the articles, but no specific contract between Browne and the company was drawn up. The company sought to remove Browne from office before the agreed time, and it was held that it was free to do so. Lindley LJ stated:

> “it would be remarkable that, upon the shares being allotted to him, a contract between him and the company, as to a matter not connected with the holding of shares, should arise.”

The Court of Appeals held that the reason based on which the learned Vacation Judge granted the plaintiff an injunction was the fact that the plaintiff had little or no notice regarding the meeting of the Board of Directors, however, the Court of Appeals differed against this observation. It stated that the length of the notice was not prescribed, and thus, it could be assumed that the notice was proper in regards to the plaintiff, since he was aware that his conduct would be assessed and his impeachment would be contested in the next meeting. In light of that, the Court of appeals concluded that it can be assumed that the plaintiff had abundant notice for the same.

The Court in Brown versus La Trinidad concluded that the rights of the Plaintiff were not violated merely because he was given short notice of the meeting being held for the impeachment of his position as a director of the company. The Court also took note of the fact that the shareholders who were present at the meeting dated October 12th were unified when approving both the proposals presented – to issue the preference shares and remove the plaintiff from the position of the director of the company. However, none of the participants of those meetings objected to the absence of the plaintiff from the meeting. The decision of the shareholders when given unanimously was indicative of the fact that the conduct of the plaintiff was unsatisfactory as compared to the assurance which was given in the pre-incorporation contract.
