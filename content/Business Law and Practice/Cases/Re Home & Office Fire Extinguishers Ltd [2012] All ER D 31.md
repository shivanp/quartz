# Re Home & Office Fire Extinguishers Ltd [2012] All ER D 31

This case illustrates that there may be an overlap between the requirement that the conduct relates to the company's affairs and personal disputes where such disputes make it impossible for the parties to continue working together as directors/shareholders. In this case, two brothers, S and G, were directors and equal shareholders in the company. S attacked G with a hammer at the company's premises following G's refusal to make a salary advance. S was charged with grievous bodily harm but acquitted. The court ordered S to sell his shares to G, holding that S's conduct related to the affairs of the company because it was a breach of the implied understanding that S and G would act properly and in good faith towards each other.
