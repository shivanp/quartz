# Foster Bryant Surveying v Bryant [2007] EWCA Civ 200

A director who was effectively forced out of the company by the other director resigned, although not to take work or clients from the company. During his notice period, the company's major client pressed Bryant to continue working with them, and he did this through a new company of his own. He was found not to have breached his fiduciary duty.

The court held that there must be “some relevant connection or link between the resignation and the obtaining of the business.” There must be a lack of good faith with which the future exploitation was planned, and the resignation was part of the dishonest plan.

Key factors for the decision seem to be that there was no ulterior purpose to Bryant's resignation as he was effectively forced out of the company, and that he did not seek the opportunity.
