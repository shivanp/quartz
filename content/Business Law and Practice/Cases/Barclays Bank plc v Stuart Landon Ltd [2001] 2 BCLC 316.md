# Barclays Bank plc v Stuart Landon Ltd [2001] 2 BCLC 316

B appealed against a decision of the district judge to set aside his earlier order granting B permission to register out of time the particulars of a legal charge over a property acquired by S. The original order had been made without prejudice to the rights of interested parties but, on an application for variation or rescission of the order by the holder of a subordinate charge, the district judge had decided that the winding up of S was virtually certain, with the result that it was inappropriate to exercise his discretion in favour of B, since the rights of unsecured creditors might be prejudiced by the late registration.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the district judge had misdirected himself as to the basis on which to exercise his discretion. The order granting permission to register out of time had conferred the necessary protection on unsecured creditors to challenge the late registration if their position was affected by it and had also protected B's interests. The only circumstance in which the granting of permission would not have been appropriate was if the judge had been satisfied that an application, following liquidation, to set aside the extension was bound to succeed, _[Victoria Housing Estates Ltd v Ashpurton Estates Ltd [1983] Ch. 110, [1982] 5 WLUK 47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE74ED920E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d0844cce23b84ee08eee1eb13948d695&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.
