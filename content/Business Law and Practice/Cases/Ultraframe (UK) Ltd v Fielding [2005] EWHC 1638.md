# Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Fielding [2005] EWHC 1638

## **Facts:**

The claimant Ultraframe (UK) Ltd and its associated companies contended that the defendant Mr Gary Fielding and his associated companies had stolen the business and assets of Ultraframe’s associated companies. The claimant also alleged that the defendant’s claim over the ownership of Ultraframe’s associated companies was based on fabricated documents.

## **Issues:**

The present case gave rise to the following issues:

(i) whether the defendant, Mr Gary Fielding, became a shadow or de facto director of Ultraframe’s two associated companies?

(ii) whether a shadow director owed duties to a company?

(iii) whether Mr Gary Fielding had misappropriated the businesses or assets of the associated companies?

(iv) whether two other parties were liable for dishonest assistance in a breach of fiduciary duty?

(v) whether any party was liable for knowing receipt of property that had been transferred in breach of fiduciary duty?

(vi)  how much Mr Gary Fielding was owed by associated companies, and whether those debts were secured or unsecured?

## **Held:**

The court gave the following judgment:

(i) Mr Gary Fielding became a de facto director of the associated companies in January 1999. He did not become a shadow director of either company;

(ii) the court took the view that a shadow director does not usually owe any fiduciary duties to the company, unless he has voluntarily assumed responsibility in relation to a particular asset;

(iii) there was no such thing as “appropriation of a business” in the abstract. If a claim was brought under the common law, a specific tort would have to be identified, and the appropriation of a business was not itself a tort;

(iv) The claims for dishonest assistance in a breach of fiduciary duty failed. It could not be concluded that a dishonest assistant was liable for the whole profit of a scheme where the assistant had not profited personally;

(v) the mere fact that a fiduciary had a substantial interest in a company which knowingly received trust property did not make the fiduciary personally accountable for the receipt;

(vi) the associated companies owed Mr Gary Fielding secured debts in the amount of GBP 108,600.11 and GBP 290,360 respectively.
