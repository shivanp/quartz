# Statutory Order of Priority on Winding up

A liquidator will (and an administrator may) be required to distribute the assets of the company to its creditors by way of a dividend. This must be done in a specified order of priority, according to rules which have no single source, but are found in different parts of IA 1986, IR 2016 and general law.

The order presented is simplified and assumes there is a [[qualifying floating charge]] (QFC) granted on or after the relevant date (15/09/2003).

Administrators may also pay dividends to unsecured creditors if they have court permission to do so. The statutory order of distribution can be affected by priority or subordination agreements entered into by creditors, under which one class of creditor agrees to rank behind another.

## Order

1. Liquidator’s fees and expenses of preserving and realising assets subject to fixed charges.
2. Amount due to fixed charge creditor out of the proceeds of selling assets subject to the fixed charge.
3. Other costs and expenses of the [[Liquidation]].
4. Preferential creditors (the first tier and then the secondary tier).
5. Creation of the prescribed part fund (if available) for unsecured creditors.
6. Amount due to creditors with floating charges.
7. Unsecured/trade creditors (including payment of the prescribed part).
8. Interest owed to unsecured creditors.
9. [[Business Law and Practice/Company Law/Shareholders]].

### Fixed Charge Assets

Assets are divided into two funds which are applied separately: the assets subject to a fixed charge, and the remaining assets. The remaining assets will be subject to the floating charge in this example, since assuming there is a QFC (a charge over the whole of the company's assets).

Assets subject to fixed charges are realised first by the liquidator. The proceeds from these assets are applied as:

1. Liquidator's costs of preserving and realising assets subject to a fixed charge;
2. Fixed charge creditors (in respect of assets subject to a fixed charge)

The proceeds of selling assets which are subject to a fixed charge must first be used to pay off the debt secured by such charge (or mortgage). The proceeds will be paid net of the liquidator's costs and associated fees of realising the assets. If the proceeds are not sufficient to discharge the debt in full, then the creditor must await payment of the balance at an appropriate later point in the order of priority. Payment of this balance will depend on whether or not the same debt was also secured by a floating charge.

### Assets Subject to a Floating Charge

Here it is presumed there is a QFC, so all the remaining assets of the company are subject to this. The remaining assets are realised, and the proceeds applied as follows:

### Other Costs and Expenses of the Liquidation

This includes the cost of selling assets secured by a floating charge, and the costs and expenses incurred in pursuing litigation (such as actions concerning [[Wrongful trading]] or voidable transactions). Such litigation will require prior approval from preferential creditors and floating charge folders, or alternatively from the Court. Otherwise, the liquidator cannot claim the costs of litigation.

### Preferential Debts (Schedule 6)

[Enterprise Act 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents) removed the preferential status of certain Crown debts, previously payable ahead of other creditors. But this has since been instated. For insolvencies occurring on or after 1/12/20, there are two tiers of preferential debts:

| Tier        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| First tier  | Wages and salary of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date (IA 1986, Sch 6, para 9), up to a maximum of £800 per person (Insolvency Proceedings (Monetary Limits) Order 1986 (SI 1986/1996), art 4).  Holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether that termination takes place before or after the insolvency date (IA 1986, Sch 6, para 10). |
| Second tier | Debts due within certain periods to HMRC in respect of PAYE, employee national insurance contributions and VAT. Note HMRC remains an unsecured creditor for corporation taxes and other taxes owed directly by the company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Prescribed Part Fund

[Enterprise Act 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents) introduced the “prescribed part” fund into the IA 1986 to increase the chance that unsecured creditors would get paid something in a liquidation. The idea is that money previously payable preferentially to the Crown is reserved for the unsecured creditors and does not flow into the pocket of floating charge holders. The prescribed part fund is sometimes referred to as the “ring-fenced” fund.

The prescribed part fund is calculated by reference to a percentage of the company's net property which is subject to floating charges (50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realisations, plus 20% of anything thereafter, up to £800,000 limit). This is set aside for distribution to the company's unsecured creditors ([s 176A IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/176)). ‘Net property’ means the proceeds of selling property other than that which is subject to a fixed charge, after deduction of the liquidator’s expenses and any preferential debts.

> [!important]
> Secured creditors are not allowed to have access to the ring-fenced fund for any unsecured portion of their debts ([[Re Airbase (UK) Ltd v HMRC [2008] EWHC 124 (Ch)]]).

The pot of money is reserved to be shared rateably among the unsecured creditors when they are paid. For this purpose, a floating charge holder who suffers a shortfall on floating charge realisations does **not** share in the prescribed part fund, although the shortfall does constitute an unsecured claim against the company.

The ring-fencing provisions only apply to realisations from floating charges created on or after the Relevant Date.

### Floating Charge Creditors

The liquidator next pays any remaining realisations from assets subject to floating charges to the floating charge holders themselves (according to the priority of their security, if there is more than one floating charge holder).

### Unsecured Creditors

These could include:

- Ordinary trade creditors who have not been paid
- Secured creditors, to the extent that security is invalid or assets subject to the security have not realised sufficient funds to pay off the secured debt.

All the unsecured creditors rank and abate equally (“pari passu” rule). So if not enough money is available, an equal percentage of the total claim of each creditor will be paid. Secured creditors who have not been paid in full from the realisation of assets subject to their security can only claim as unsecured creditors against realisations from unsecured assets, so they are **not** eligible for any payment from the prescribed part fund.

### Interest on Unsecured (including preferential) Debts

Interest accruing on unsecured debts from the commencement of the winding up.

### Shareholders

The shareholders who participate in the equity of the company will rank last. Their rights, as between themselves, will depend on the rights attributable to their particular class/ classes of shares. This will be written into the Articles of Association. Preferential shareholders may have preferential rights to a return of their capital on a winding up in priority to ordinary shareholders.

In most insolvent liquidations, the shareholders are unlikely to receive any value from their shares.

> [!defn] Rank and abate equally
> Means that all creditors in a particular category share the money available.
