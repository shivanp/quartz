# Administration

## Administration

Administration is a procedure aiming to rescue a company which is insolvent if at all possible, or to achieve a better result for creditors if not.

It is a “collective procedure”, meaning the administrator acts in the interests of the creditors as a whole rather than on behalf of a particular creditor.

Administrators are qualified insolvency practitioners, who can be appointed by the court or under the out-of-court procedure.

The main advantage is that the administrator has the benefit of a moratorium, allowing them to operate almost unhindered by creditors from the outset.

### Administrative Receivership

The new administration procedure can into effect on 15/09/03, replacing administrative receivership. Administrative receivership still exists for charges created before 15 September 2003.

Whilst administration is a collective procedure; in contrast, receivership is an individual enforcement procedure which benefits only the appointing creditor.

When a particular creditor (for example, a bank) have significant control of a company’s assets, they have the power to call in ‘an administrative receiver’ if a floating charge that was granted before 15 September 2003 is breached. Whereas administration offers a possible route towards a return to profitability, receivership means the end of a company, often ending in liquidation.

Main defects:

- Administrative receivership seen to be too slanted towards the interests of the secured creditor who appointed the receiver.
- Unwieldy and expensive.

### Purpose

[s 8 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/8) and [Schedule B1 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/schedule/B1) set out the objectives of the administration.

State that an administrator

> “…must perform his functions with the objective of:  
> (a) rescuing the company as a going concern, or  
> (b) achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up…,  
> (c) realising the property in order to make a distribution to one or more secure or preferential creditors.”

These cascading objectives guide the actions of the administrator throughout the process. Objective (b) is most likely to be achieved.

The administrator can only move down the list if the alternative is not reasonably practicable, or if (b) is better for the creditors as a whole and (c) will not unnecessarily harm them ((IA 1986, Sch B1, para 3(3) and (4))).

The administrator has to perform all their duties in the interests of the company’s creditors as a whole (IA 1986, Sch B1, para 3(2)).

### Appointment

#### Court Procedure

The court may appoint an administrator where the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts (IA 1986, Sch B1 para 10) on the application of (IA 1986, Sch B1 para 12):

- The company
- The [[directors]]
- One or more creditors.

The appointment may only be made where the order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of the administration (Sch B1 para 11(b)):

> The court may make an administration order in relation to a company only if satisfied—  
> (a) that the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts, and  
> (b) that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration

See [[AA Mutual International Insurance Co Ltd [2004] EWHC Ch 1]].

> [!action]
> As soon as reasonably practicable after making the application, the applicant must notify:
> 1. any person who has appointed (or is entitled to appoint) an administrative receiver of the company;
> 2. any qualifying floating charge holder (QFCH) who may be entitled to appoint an administrator; and
> 3. such other persons as may be prescribed by the IR 2016.

#### Out of Court Procedure

The following parties may appoint an administrator using the out-of-court procedure:

- The company (Sch B1 para 22(1))
- The [[directors]] (Sch B1 para 22(2)); or
- A [[Qualifying Floating Charge]] holder (Sch B1 para 14)

> [!defn] Qualifying Floating Charge Holder 'QFCH'
> TLDR: The holder of a floating charge created after 15 September 2003 relating to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property ([Sch B1 para 14 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/schedule/B1)). 
> 
> ---
> 
> A qualifying floating charge (QFC) is one where the charge document:
> - (a) states that para 14 of Sch B1 to the IA 1986 applies to it and–
> 	- (i) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrator of the company, or
> 	- (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to make an appointment which would be the appointment of an administrative receiver within the meaning given by s 29(2) of the IA 1986; and
> - (b) is a QFC which, on its own or with other security held by the same lender, relates to the whole, or substantially the whole, of the company’s property (para 14(3)).

The most common method of appointing an administrator is by directors using the out-of-court procedure.

> [!warning] Exception
> 
> Directors **cannot** use the out-of-court procedure where a creditor has presented a petition for the winding up of the company. The directors can then apply to court for an administration order, or the qualifying floating charge holder can use the out-of-court procedure to appoint an administrator. 

### Statutory Moratorium

Key benefit: during administration, the company is given a **moratorium** (Sch B1 para 42-44 IA 1986). During this time, all business documents and the company website must state that the company is in administration.

During the moratorium (except with the consent of the court/ administrator):

1. No order or resolution to wind up the company can be made/ passed
2. No administrative receiver of the company can be appointed
3. No steps can be taken to enforce any [[security]] over the company's property, or to repossess goods subject to security, hire-purchase and retention of title;
4. No legal proceedings, execution or other process can be commenced or continued against the company or its property, and
5. A landlord cannot forfeit a lease of the company’s premises by means of peaceable re-entry.

### Appointment by a QFCH

Lenders with a QFC can easily appoint administrators.

If there is another QFCH whose charge would have priority, the lender cannot appoint an administrator until it has given 2 business days' written notice of its intention. Allows the holder of prior charge time to consider whether to appoint an administrator itself (effectively a very short interim moratorium).

The floating charge must be enforceable, due to the occurrence of some trigger event, e.g., late payment by the borrower.

It is not possible for a QFCH to appoint an administrator out-of-court under IA 1986, Sch B1, para 14 where there is a provisional liquidator or an administrative receiver already appointed, or the company is already being wound up.

> [!action]
> Notice of appointment has to be filed at court by the lender together with various documents. The notice must include a statutory declaration by the lender to the effect that:
> 1. the lender is the holder of a QFC in respect of the company’s property;
> 2. the floating charge has become enforceable; and
> 3. the appointment is in accordance with IA 1986, Sch B1.

Once these documents have been filed at court (and the other parts of Sch B1, para 18 are complied with) the administration begins.

An 'old' floating charge before 15 September 2003, which complies with the para 14(3) conditions will enable the lender to choose between appointing an administrator and appointing an administrative receiver.

### Process

1. Administrator appointed
2. Main moratorium comes into effect
3. Administrator puts forward proposals
	1. Creditors may seek further details or amend proposals (IA 1986, Sch B1, para 53(1)(b)).
	2. Creditors have final say on this: the proposal is approved if a majority in value of creditors present and voting vote in favour (so long as unconnected with company).

### Effects

The effects of the administration order are:

1. The company is managed by the administrator
2. The directors' powers cease, though they are still in office
3. Moratorium continues
4. Administrator controls the company's assets; and
5. Administrator carries out administrator's proposals, which have been approved by creditors.

### Powers and Duties

Administrators have wide powers to

> “do all such things as may be necessary for the management of the affairs, business and property of the company”

These include powers to:

- Remove and appoint directors (s 14, Sch 1 and para 61 Sch B1)
- Call a meeting of creditors or administrators, if required (para 62 Sch B1)
- Apply to the court for directions (para 63 Sch B1)
- Pay money to a creditor, but only with court permission if they are an unsecured creditor (para 65)
- Pay money to any party if likely to assist the administration (para 66)
- Dispose of property subject to a floating charge (para 70 Sch B1);
- Dispose of property subject to a fixed charge (with the court's consent) (Para 71 Sch B1).
- Deal with property that is subject to a hire-purchase agreement (para 72)

Additionally, the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (SBEEA 2015) granted additional powers to administrators to allow them to bring proceedings against directors for fraudulent and [[Wrongful trading]].

#### Approach of the Court

In [[Re T & D Industries Ltd [2000] 1 LWR 646]], held that administration was meant to be a cheaper, more commercial alternative to liquidation, so the administrator had substantial autonomy to act without consulting the court.

### End of Administration

The administration may be ended (Sch B1 IA 1986):

1. Automatically after 1 year from the date the administration took effect (may be extended) (para 76).
2. On application by the administrator to the court (para 79) if:
	1. They think the purpose of administration cannot be achieved
	2. They think the company should not have entered administration.
	3. Creditors' meeting requires them to make an application, or
	4. They think the purpose of administration has been sufficiently achieved in relation to the company.
3. By termination where the object has been achieved (para 80)
4. By the court ending the administration on the application of a creditor (para 81)
5. By the court converting the administration into a liquidation in the public interest (para 82)
6. By the administrator converting the administration into a CVL (para 83)
7. By the administrator dissolving the company where they believe there is no property which might permit a distribution to creditors (para 84);
8. When the administrator resigns (para 87), is removed (para 88), ceases to be qualified (para 89) or is replaced by those who appointed the administrator in the first place (paras 92, 93, 94).

### Pre-pack Administration

A pre-packaged administration is where the business of an insolvent company is prepared for sale to a selected buyer, prior to the company's entry into administration. The agreed sale is carried out by an insolvency practitioner shortly after their appointment. Often, the pre-pack purchaser will be one or more of the existing owners or directors of the insolvent company.

Pre-packaged sales are controversial, particularly where the sale is to existing members or management. The concern is that often creditors are given insufficient information to determine whether the sale was in their best interests. The unsecured creditors are not consulted and are unlikely to be paid their debts.

This concern led to calls for greater transparency, and the Association of Business Recovery Professionals issued a Statement of Insolvency Practice (SIP) in 2013, requiring clear, comprehensive and timely explanations to creditors following pre-packaged sales. The administrator must disclose to unsecured creditors:

- Source of administrator's introduction
- Extent of administrator's involvement prior to appointment
- Valuations of the business or the underlying assets
- Alternative courses of action considered
- Why it was not appropriate to keep the business trading and sell it as a going concern
- Whether efforts were made to consult major creditors
- Identities of purchasers and any connections to former management.

The government have since passed Administration (Restrictions on Disposal etc to Connected Persons) Regulations 2021 (SI 2021/427) which came into force on 30 April 2021. These impose more onerous obligations.
