# Debt vs equity finance

## Return on Investment

### Equity

- Dividends
	- Only paid when the company is sufficiently profitable.
	- Directors usually have cmoplete discretion, even when the company is profitable.
- Capital growth

### Debt

- Interest

## Getting Money Back

### Equity

- Solvent companies may be wound up, and in this case shareholders will receive back the full amount of their investment and potentially a fraction of the surplus capital.
- On the sale of shares. Private companies not permitted to offer shares to a public.
- If company buys back its own shares
- On a successful unfair prejudice claim, if the other shareholders buy out the claimant.

### Debt

- As agreed between the parties in the loan agreement or in the terms of the bond
- Usually either in one bullet repayment on maturity or amortising through instalments
- On the sale of the debt: bonds usually tradeable by the investor before maturity. Loans can in some circumstances by sold by the lender.

A shareholder has no guaranteed income from their investment, whereas a lender does. Shareholder's capital is not repaid unless the company is wound up. But a lender will agree with the company a date for repayment of the capital sum loaned.

If a shareholder wishes to sell their shares in order to realise their capital investment in the company, the transfer of their shares is governed by the articles, and in a private company these usually restrict the shareholderâ€™s choice (e.g., MA 26(5)).

## Priority on Winding up

### Equity

Shareholders paid back after everyone else. In practice, highly unlikely to receive full value of their investment if the company is insolvent when winding up.

Arrangements may be made between shareholders as to priority between themselves (preference shareholders > ordinary shareholders).

### Debt

- Creditors paid before shareholders
- Creditors can improve priority by taking security for the debt: secured creditors have priority over unsecured creditors. Fixed charge creditors take priority over floating creditors.
- Creditors may contractually agree to give priority to some lenders and subordinate others.

## Control

### Equity

- Shareholders may have voting rights
- Existence and extent will depend on the rights granted upon the issue of shares
- Think about powers if you own >50% to do

### Debt

- Lenders require the borrower to give undertakings: promises to do, or not do, certain things in the running of business (such as disposing of assets without the lender's consent)
- Security may also give the lender control over the assets which are subject to the security (e.g., like with a fixed charge)

## Tax Treatment

The payment of a dividend is not a deductible expense for the company. Payment of debenture interest, as it is incurred for the purposes of the trade, is a normal  
trading expense of the company, and so is deductible by it in computing trading profit before its corporation tax is assessed.

## Other Factors

### Equity

- New shareholders must be found in order for a share issue to succeed

### Debt

- Banks may not be willing to lend on attractive terms, or if the company is too highly geared. Gearing is the ratio of debt to equity.
- Existing loan agreements would need to be checked for undertakings which would prevent the borrower from borrowing more/ granting security
- Interest is a deductible expense for tax purposes, which makes debt more attractive.
- Involvement of investor
	- Shareholder has a degree of influence over how the company is run.
- Repayment of capital
	- Loan capital must be repaid at some date in the future, possibly on demand
- Cost
	- Cost of debt finance is the interest rate charged by the lender to the borrowing company.
	- Cost of equity finance are the likely returns to the new shareholder, including dividends, capital appreciation and share buybacks. These returns are the cost to existing shareholders.
- Existing restrictions
	- May be restrictions in the articles/ existing facilities agreements against the taking out of new loans or debt.
