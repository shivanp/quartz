# Piercing corporate veil

Refers to situations in which courts may go behind the corporate framework and company's separate legal personality to make the **shareholders** of a company liable.

## Doctrine

Supreme Court decision in [[Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] 2 AC 415]] clarified case law in these situations:

> The court may pierce the corporate veil only where a person under an existing legal obligation or restriction deliberately evades or frustrates that obligation or restriction by setting up a company.

Note that remains a v narrow jurisdiction and used sparingly. Only ever pierced to the extent required to right the wrong.

Cases before 2013 can be divided into:

1. Application of statute
2. Common law
3. Application of a contractual term

## Statutory Examples

Not examples of piercing the corporate veil, rather instances in which those behind a company can be treated by statute as liable in specific circumstances.

1. Taxation: group structures need to be treated differently for disclosure and financial reporting purposes ([s399 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/399) requires parent companies to produce group accounts, [s409 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/409) requires parent companies to provide details of names of subsidiaries and shares held in subsidiaries)
2. Employment: Employment Rights Act 1996 protects employees' statutory rights when transferred from one company to another within the group, maintaining continuity of employment.
3. Corporate insolvency: s213-215 Insolvency Act 1986 provide offences of fraudulent trading and [[Wrongful trading]] where those involved in a company may be liable to contribute to debts of insolvent company.

## Common Law

Pre-2013, cases where court had been requested to allow lifting of veil were cases of

- Façade/ sham companies
	- Court has lifted veil in these instances
	- [[Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch 935]]
	- [[Jones v Lipman [1962] 1 WLR 832]]
	- [[Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 2 BCLC]]
- Single Economic Entity
	- Parent companies are not liable for their subsidies other than in specific statutory circumstances.
		- [[DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets [1976] 1 WLR 852]]
		- [[Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional Council [1978] SLT 159]]
		- [[Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433]] – enterprises may purposely use company group structures to place more risky ventures/ liability in subsidiary companies removed from the parent.
- Agency
	- Liability based on law of agency cannot lift corporate veil
	- Company has power to act as an agent for its parent company or individual shareholders if authorised, but no presumption that this is the case. In absence of express agreement, difficult to establish liability of shareholder or parent. And in these cases, the argument is based on law of agency, not piercing of the corporate veil, anyway.
- Tort
	- Parents companies may be liable to those dealing with their subsidiaries on the basis of tort, but this doesn't count as lifting the corporate veil.
	- [[VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corp and others [2013] UKSC 5]] veil not pierced because alternative remedy of [[Misrepresentation]]
	- [[Chandler v Cape plc [2012] EWCA 525 CA]] parent company held to be liable in tort for asbestos related injuries suffered by the employees of the foreign subsidiary company, since the parent was held to owe a duty of care to the subsidiary's employees through its control of the subsidiary's health and safety policy.

## Key Case

[[Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] 2 AC 415]]: the Supreme Court concluded that, although this was not a case in which the corporate veil should be pierced, the properties were found to be held in trust by the company for the husband (the principal shareholder) and therefore an order was made for the sale of the property and for the money to be given to the wife.

This confirmed that piercing the veil may exist as a matter of law, but very rare for principle to be invoked in practice.

Where other routes to infer liability on shareholders are available (tortious liability, law of trust or agency) court will infer liability on these principles instead.

Subsequent cases (e.g., [[Antonio Gramsci Shipping Corpn v Recoletos Ltd [2013] EWCA Civ 730]]) have followed this precedent.
