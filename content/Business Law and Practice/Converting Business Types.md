## Unincorporated to Ltd

### Formalities

- Form or purchase a company and sell the existing business to it in exchange for shares in the company + possibly debentures (loan to company) or cash.
- Sale of business effected through a contract for sale, which will
	- Describe the asset being sold
	- Describe the price and the way in which it will be paid
	- Apportion the price to show the value attributed to various assets
	- Covenants designed to indemnify the sellers in respect of liability for existing debts, liabilities etc.
	- Contain the company's acceptance of the seller's title to the premises and of the equipment and stock in its current condition.

Title to assets may be passed:

1. Under the sale agreement
2. By physical delivery
3. Under a separate document.

If the company takes over the previous name of the business $\neq$ company name, company stationery and notice at company's business must state the company's name and address (CA 2006 ss 1202-1204).

### Income Tax

The individual partners will be assets for income tax under the rules for the **closing tax year** of a business up to the date of transfer of the business. Then the company pays corporation tax.

#### Capital Allowances

Where the partnership sells the company assets on which capital allowances have been claimed, there may be a **balancing charge to income tax** on any profit identified by comparing sale proceeds with write-down value. The profit/ loss would be taxed as part of the trading income in the closing tax year.

If the company is controlled by the sellers of the business, the company and the sellers can elect within **two years** that the **company shall take over the position of the sellers** so that no balancing charge occurs (CAA 2001, ss 266 and 267).

#### Trading Losses

If the unincorporated business makes trading losses not relieved when the business is transferred to the company, the losses can be carried forward and deducted from income received by the former partners from the company (e.g., dividends, salaries). Only available if business is transferred to the company **wholly or mainly in return for the issue of shares in the company**.

### Capital Gains

Business transferred to company: disposal to the company by individual partners of assets. Insofar as these are chargeable assets for CGT purposes, may be CGT charge. Consider reliefs.

#### Roll Over Relief on Incorporation of Business (s 162 TCGA 1992)

To apply, the business must be sold to the company as a going concern with all of its assets (excluding cash). But transferring all the assets can be problematic:

- Possible SDLT on land transfer
- Other expenses (legal costs)
- Possible double charge to taxation in relation to the future gain of assets transferred
- Availability of assets transferred for payment of the company's creditors.

Taxpayer may choose not to roll over their gain, to claim:

- EIS deferral relief
- Business asset disposal relief
- Annual exemption.

### Other Considerations

- SDLT
	- Chargeable on land transactions (FA 2003)
- VAT implications
	- Sellers must charge VAT on the transaction if the company is not registered for VAT purposes before the sale takes place.
	- So make sure the company is registered.
- Employees
	- The rights of employees are automatically transferred under Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006.

## Private to Public Company

- No tax or employee implications
- Possibility of public financing
- May affect the capital reliefs available to shareholders
	- IHT: Business Property Relief and instalment option
	- CGT: BAD dependent on the company being a "personal trading company"; hard to establish if shares quoted.
