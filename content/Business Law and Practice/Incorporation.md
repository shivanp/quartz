# Incorporation

Client wishing to start a new business can either

- Incorporate a new company from scratch
- Purchase a shelf company

## Incorporation From Scratch

Must apply to the Registrar of Companies to have the new company registered at Companies House. Need to deliver ([s 9 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/9)):

1. A copy of company's **memorandum**
2. **Articles** prescribing regulations for the company (if not intending to use Model Articles)
3. **Fee** (depending on whether standard or same-day incorporation service chosen)
4. Application for registration (**form IN01**) saying
	- Name
	- Registered office location
	- Whether liability is limited
	- Whether company public or private
	- Statement of capital and initial shareholdings ([s 10 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/10))
	- Statement of proposed officers ([s 12 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/12))
	- Guarantee (if company limited by guarantee) ([s 11 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/11))
	- Statement of compliance that the requirements of CA 2006 have been complied with ([s 13 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/13))

Once the Registrar of Companies has approved the application for incorporation of the company, the company is sent a certificate of incorporation authenticated by the Registrar's official seal. Sets out:

- Company name (though this can be changed later),
- Registered number. This will never change, and so should be used when drafting legal agreements to which the company is a party.
- Date of incorporation.

The company becomes a legal entity ([s 16(3) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/16)) from the date of incorporation set out in the certificate of incorporation ([s 15 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/15)).

## Purchasing Shelf Company

Shelf company set up in advance, with the traditional advantage of speed (avoiding need to draft and submit documentation). Note that this option still has the advantage of being an available option all the time on every day of the year, whereas online incorporation can only take place during Companies House opening hours.

Need to probably change name and articles, submit client's chosen address for first registered office ([s 87 (1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/87)) and details of members directors and company secretary.

Note that for these changes, a special resolution of the shareholders is required ([s 77 (1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/77)).
