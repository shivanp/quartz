# Equity finance

## Types of Capital

Terminology | Definition
---|---
Capital | All the assets of a company (including debt finance, shares, assets)
Legal capital | Share capital: value received from investors who subscribe for the company's shares.

Private companies have no legal minimum capital requirements. Under [s 763 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/763) public companies have a minimum legal capital requirement of £50,000. This is to protect creditors.

## Issue of Shares

- Shares may not be issued at a discount (held that this was beyond the power of a company in [[Ooregum Gold Mining Co of India v Roper [1892] AC 125, HL]]; now prohibited by [s 552 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/552))
- Shares can be issued at a premium, though they don't have to be ([[Hilder v Dexter [1902] AC 474]])

Shareholders enjoy benefits:

- Get dividends
- Capital return if value of shares increases
- Often voting rights, so input in management of company

But also bear risks:

- Creditors are paid from the company's assets; shareholders are liable up to the amount invested
- Creditors paid first in an insolvency

## Protection for Shareholders

There are statutory protections to prevent directors from issuing new shares without the knowledge and consent of the existing shareholders.

Four key issues that directors must consider when the company is seeking to issue new shares:

### Limit on the Company's Authorised Share Capital

Though rare, a company's Articles may limit the amount of share capital a company may issue.

Companies incorporated prior to CA 2006 had an 'authorised share capital': a limit on the amount of shares that could be issued in their memorandum of association. Historical limits are deemed to be transferred into the Articles by [s 28 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/28).

### Limitations on the Power of Directors to Issue Shares

Directors require authorisation of shareholders to issue new shares in most circumstances.

[s 549 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/549) states directors have no power to issue shares except:

1. In accordance with [s 550 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/550)
	- Gives directors of a private company which only has a **single class of shares**, and where the articles do not state otherwise, automatic authorisation to issue new shares of the same class
2. Where shareholders authorise the directors to issue new shares under [s 551 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/551)
	- Shareholders may grant directors authorisation to issue new shares by ordinary resolution
	- Can last up to 5 years, and is for a certain number of shares only

### Pre-emption Rights

Shareholders have rights of first refusal when the company issues new shares in most circumstances ([s 561 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/561)). This only applies where the shares to be issued are [[Equity securities]]. So it does not apply to preference shares that have capped participating rights as to both dividends and capital.

#### Exceptions and Exclusions

The right to pre-emption does not apply where the new shares to be issued are:

- Bonus shares;
- Shares issued under an employee share scheme
- Shares issued for non-cash consideration ([s 564 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/564)).

A company may exclude the right of pre-emption by specific provision in the articles ([s 567-568 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/567)). However, this is not common.

More commonly, the pre-emption rights are disapplied by a special resolution of the shareholders:

- Directors of a private limited company with only one class of shares may be given power by the articles or by a special resolution, to allot equity securities of that class as if s 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption) did not apply, or applied with such modifications as the directors may determine ([s 569 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/569)).
- Pre-emption rights may also be disapplied by special resolution under [s 570 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/570) where the directors of the company are acting under a general authority ([s 551 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/551)) to issue shares. In this situation, pre-emption rights are disapplied for all shares issued in accordance with this general authority.
- [s 571 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/571): shareholders may pass a special resolution to disapply pre-emption rights in relation to a particular share allotment only.

#### Pre-emption Rights on Transfer of Shares

In general, there are no rights of pre-emption for existing shareholders where shareholders transfer shares.

But a private company may provide for pre-emption rights on transfer of shares in either the articles or a shareholder agreement. This is common in small private companies.

But if the private company has a corporate shareholder, the transfer of shares by this corporate shareholder will not trigger pre-emption rights provisions ([[Re Coroin [2011] EWHC 3466]]).

### Class Rights

When a company issues shares of a new class, the class rights need to be set out in the company's articles.

A special resolution is required to amend the company's articles in order to set out the new class rights.

## Maintenance of Share Capital

The doctrine of capital maintenance states that the company must maintain and not reduce its share capital except in certain very limited circumstances. The share capital therefore is a permanent fund available to creditors.

The doctrine was developed from [[Trevor v Whitworth (1887) 12 App Cases 409]], with the goal of protecting creditors. Creditor perspective: the share capital of a company gives an indication of its creditworthiness. Unsecured creditors will seek to claim payment from the company's capital as well as its unsecured assets if the company is wound up.

Capital can still be lost as a result of poor business decisions or market conditions, but this is a legitimate risk to both shareholders and creditors.

Many companies, large and small, have very limited share capital: so the doctrine doesn't really protect creditors much in this case.

> [!important] Doctrine of capital maintenance ([s 658 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/658))
> 
>  1. A limited company must not acquire its own shares, whether by purchase, subscription or otherwise, except in accordance with the provisions of this Part.
>  2. If a company purports to act in contravention of this section—
> (a) an offence is committed by (i) the company, and (ii) every officer of the company who is in default, and
> (b) the purported acquisition is void.
> 

[s 659 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/659) provides a set of limited exceptions.

### Impact of Doctrine

The doctrine has an impact on a number of transactions:

- The granting of dividends/ distributions
- Reduction of share capital
- Purchase and redemption of own shares

The doctrine of capital maintenance limits the funds from which the company may pay dividends to its shareholders, since the payment of a dividend will reduce the company's assets available to **creditors**.

## Dividends

A dividend is a “distribution” under the definition in [s 829(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/829), which states that “distribution” means every description of distribution of a company's assets to its members, whether in cash or otherwise, subject to the exceptions set out in s 829(2).

[s 830(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/830): a company may pay dividends only out of “**distributable profits**”. These are defined (s 830(2)) as the company's

> “accumulated, realised profits, so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulated, realised losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital duly made.”

### Relevant Accounts

[s 836 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/836) sets out the 'relevant accounts' for the purposes of ascertaining whether a company has sufficient distributable profits for the payment of dividends.

Most recent annual accounts must usually be referred to. In some circumstances, specially prepared interim accounts may be appropriate, e.g., when a company has realised a substantial profit since the annual accounts were prepared.

For a new company without annual accounts, initial accounts may be prepared to justify paying a dividend.

### Types of Dividend

Type of dividend | Description
---|---
Dividend | Involves the distribution of profits by way of cash to shareholders.
Scrip dividend | Where a company gives the existing shareholders further shares in the company, rather than cash.
Dividend in specie | Involves the company giving shareholders value by way of assets.

When recommending a dividend, the directors must have regard to all their duties, particularly the duty to promote the success of the company ([[s 172 CA 2006]]).

### Final Dividends

MA 30(2): the directors decide whether it is appropriate to pay a dividend to shareholders. The shareholders in a GM will actually declare the dividend under MA 30(1). The shareholders cannot  
vote to pay themselves more than the directors have recommended, although they could decide that a smaller amount was more appropriate.

Articles may provide that final dividends can be paid without any shareholder involvement.

### Interim Dividend

- Usually of a lesser amount than the final dividend
- Recommended by the **directors alone**

### Disguised Distributions

The courts have found that there has been a “disguised” return of capital to shareholders, breaching the capital maintenance principle, in some less obvious cases.

- [[Re Halt Garage (1964) Ltd [1982] 3 All ER 1016, ChD]]: directors salary
- [[Aveling Barford Ltd v Perion Ltd [1989] BCLC 626]]: intra-group transfers

### Unlawful Distributions

When an unlawful distribution is made, both the directors who authorised the distribution and the shareholders receiving it may be liable.

> [!warning]
> If a dividend is paid when there are insufficient profits available for the purpose, the directors who authorised the payment are jointly and severally liable to the company for the full amount.

- Directors who knew or ought to have known that the payment amounted to a breach are liable to personally repay the dividends ([[Bairstow v Queens Moat Houses plc [2001] EWCA Civ 712]]).
- [s 847 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/847) provides that where a distribution is made in contravention of the requirements of the Act, and if at the time of distribution the member knows or has reasonable grounds for believing the distribution to have been unlawful, they are liable to repay it to the company ([[It's a Wrap (UK) Ltd v Gula [2006] EWCA Civ 544]]).

### Steps Board Must Take

Before issuing a dividend, the board must consider:

1. Directors' duties: if making the distribution is in accordance with duties [[s 171 CA 2006]] and [[s 172 CA 2006]].
2. Restrictions on distributions: consider whether proposed transaction is either a dividend or disguised distribution ([[Aveling Barford Ltd v Perion Ltd [1989] BCLC 626]]).
3. Are there any distributable profits? Check relevant accounts
4. Amount of distribution: does the distributable profit cover the whole amount of distribution.
