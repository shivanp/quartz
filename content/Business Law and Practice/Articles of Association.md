# Articles of Association

All companies must have articles of association ([s 18 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/18)). These form the main constitutional document of a company, regulating relationships between shareholders, directors, and the company.

## Example Provisions

- Number of directors required to transact business (both to form a quorum and take decisions at board meetings).
- Method of appointment of directors
- Powers of directors
- How board meetings conducted
- Any special shares rights
- Conduct of shareholder meetings
- How and to whom shareholders can transfer [[Shares]].

## Form of Articles

Articles must comply with the minimum provisions of CA 2006 (the Legality Test).

- A company may in certain circumstances provide a procedure in its Articles which is more onerous than that contained in CA 2006.
- Some of the provisions in CA 2006 cannot be overruled by the Articles – such as the right to demand a poll vote at a general meeting ([s 321 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/321)).
- There are powers available to companies by default unless removed explicitly by the provisions – such as the power of a private company to issue redeemable shares.

Basically, there are 3 choices:

1. [Model Articles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares). Secretary of State has prescribed MA for different types of company. If a company does not register Articles at Companies House, [s 20(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/20) provides them with a default one.
2. Amended MA – take standard template and change some stuff
3. Tailor-made MA – ask solicitor to draft. Very time-consuming and costly though.

## Amending Articles

Articles can be amended at any point in the future by a *special resolution* ([s 21 (1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/21)).

[s 22 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/22) permits entrenchment of specific provisions, though this is rare in practice. An entrenched provision of a company's Articles is one which can only be amended or repealed if specific conditions are met, or if procedures more restrictive than a special resolution are complied with. But even these entrenched provisions can always be amended by agreement of all members, or by a court order ([s 22(3) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/22)).

- Basic rule: to be valid, any alteration to Articles must be made bona fide in the interests of the company as a whole ([[Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa [1900] 1 Ch 656 ]]).
- In [[Shuttleworth v Cox Bros Ltd [1927] 2 KB 9]] court held that amendment to Articles is not valid if no reasonable man could consider it to be for the benefit of the company.
- In [[Sidebottom v Kershaw, Leese & Co Ltd [1920] 1 Ch 154 (Court of Appeal)]] the company successfully defended having altered articles introducing a provision giving directors to buy out the shareholdings of any member competing with the company's business.
- In [[Re Charterhouse Capital Ltd [2015] EWCA Civ 536 (Court of Appeal)]], amendment of a company's articles to permit shares of minority shareholder to be compulsorily acquired under takeover offer held to be valid.

## Legal Effect of Articles

The nature of contract established by Articles set out in [s 33 (1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/33) — provides that

>the provisions in the company's Articles bind the company and its members to the same extent as if there were covenants on the part of the company and each member to observe these provisions.

So binding and enforceable on both the company and its members. In general, the usual rules of contractual interpretation apply to the Articles. But there are some differences:

| Ratio | Case |
| ----- | ---- |
|The articles cannot be supplemented by additional terms implied from extrinsic circumstances | [[Bratton Seymour Service Co Ltd v Oxborough [1992] BCLC 693 (Court of Appeal)]]
|The court has no jurisdiction to rectify the articles | [[Scott v Frank F Scott (London) Ltd [1940] Ch 794 (Court of Appeal)]]
|As long as the article in question is clear and unambiguous and not 'commercially absurd', the court will not interfere to rewrite the article, even where the outcome is “improbable” | [[Sugarman v CJS Investments LLP [2014] EWCA Civ 1239]]
|However terms can be 'implied' where necessary for the proper construction of the articles | [[Equitable Life Assurance Society v Hyman [2002] 1 AC 408 (House of Lords)]]

## Legal Effect of Articles pre-CA 2006

Predecessor to s 33 (1) CA 2006 was s 14 CA 1985, and this was subject to lots of case law.

General rule: the Articles evidence a contract between the company and its members in their capacity as members and with respect to their rights and obligations as members ([[Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep-Breeders’ Association [1915] 1 Ch 881 (Ch)]]).

### Articles as a Contract Between Company and Members

Courts have willingly prevented a company infringing the rights of its members in breach of the Articles by granting an injunction. A member may not enforce any rights contained in the Articles against the company that are not relevant to his capacity as a member ([[Eley v Positive Government Security Life Assurance Company (1876) 1 Ex D 88 (CA)]]).

### Articles as a Contract Between Members Themselves

Although courts have acknowledged that the forerunners to s 33 CA 2006 provide that the Articles constitute a contract between the members themselves, as well as between the company and its members, there is conflicting authority as to whether one member may enforce the Articles against another member directly ([[Rayfield v Hands [1960] Ch 1 (Ch)]]), or require that the company enforce the provisions against the member ([[Welton v Saffery [1897] AC 299]]).

If a member is likely to wish to enforce rights against other members, it is advisable to enter a shareholders' agreement (private agreement between shareholders, enforceable as a contract between members).

## Enforcement of the Articles

General principle: any member has the right to enforce the terms of the articles against the company under s 33, and the company is under s 33 entitled to enforce and restrain breaches of the articles against its members.

| Ratio | Case |
| ----- | ---- |
|Directors cannot act in ways inconsistent with the articles | [[Wood v Odessa Waterworks Co (1889) 42 Ch D 636]]
|Members whose personal rights have been infringed may bring a personal action to enforce these rights, even where the conduct complained of may also constitute a wrong to the company itself | [[Pender v Lushington (1877) 6 Ch D 70]]
|Articles only create a contract between a company and the members in their capacity as members, and not in any special or personal capacity. They do not give rights to any person who is not a member | [[Eley v Positive Government Security Life Assurance Company (1876) 1 Ex D 88 (CA)]]
|The members are bound by this contract | [[Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep-Breeders’ Association [1915] 1 Ch 881 (Ch)]]
|A member may sue another on the contract created by the articles without joining the company as a party | [[Rayfield v Hands [1960] Ch 1 (Ch)]]
