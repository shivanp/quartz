# Directors

## Duties and Powers

- Responsible for day to day management of company.
- Agents of the company: conduct governed by statute and common law principles of agency
- Owe fiduciary duties to the company, codified under CA 2006.
- Some decisions, such as changing a company's Articles ([s 21 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/21)), cannot be made by directors and must be made by shareholders.
- References in CA 2006 to 'the directors of a company' are references to the company's board.

## Number and Nature

[s 154 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/154):

- Private company must have at least 1 director
- Public company must have at least two

Can put a higher number in Articles of Association. At least one director must be a natural person ([s 155(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/155)). New legislation coming into place (Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015) which will make it basically impossible to have other [[Companies]] as directors. Minimum age limit of 16 to be a director ([s 157 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/157)).

## Types of Director

### Executive Director

Appointed to an executive office (finance, managing, …). Both an officer and employee of their company.

### Non-executive Director

Also an officer of the company, but not an employee of the company. The role involves independent guidance and advice to the board, and protecting the interests of shareholders.

### Shadow Directors

Defined under [s 251 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/251):

> A person in accordance with whose directions and instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act.

But a person is not deemed a shadow director by reason only that the directors act on advice given by them in a professional capacity (s 251(2) CA 2006). This legislation is designed to prevent a disqualified from getting the prohibitions placed on them and still being involved in the running of a company.

### Alternate Directors

Companies may provide in their Articles for the appointment of alternate directors. An alternate director attends board meetings and acts in place of director, if the actual director is incapacitated/ away. Usually approved by resolution of board of directors.

### De Facto Directors

Someone who assumes to act as a director but has in fact not been validly appointed, and therefore is not a de jure director.

## Appointment of Directors

CA 2006 does not stipulate a procedure for appointing directors, so this is generally governed by the Articles of the company. MA deals with this as follows:

> 17.—(1) Any person who is willing to act as a director, and is permitted by law to do so, may be appointed to be a director—
>
> (a) by ordinary resolution, or
>
> (b) by a decision of the directors.

Decision of directors is usually used since this is easier. But ALWAYS check the Articles for any modifications.

## Directors' Service Contracts

An executive director will be an employee of the company and should be given a written contract of employment (service contract), setting out their duties, remuneration package, notice provisions etc. MA 19: the terms of an individual director's service contract, including remuneration, are for the board to determine. Generally, only a resolution of the board of directors is required.

But where a service contract provides for a director's employment to have a guaranteed term which is, or may be, longer than **two years**, [s188 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/188) applies. This says shareholder approval needed for such a long-term contract.

If shareholder approval is not given, then the term incorporated into the service contract will be in contravention of s 188 and void under [s 189(a) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/189). Under [s 189(b) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/189), the service contract will be deemed to contain a term entitling the company to terminate the contract at any time, by the giving of reasonable notice.
