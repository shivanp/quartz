# Limited Liability Company

## Constitution and Documents

> [!statute] s 7 CA 2006
> (1) A company is formed under this Act by one or more persons—
> - (a) subscribing their names to a memorandum of association (see section 8), and
> - (b) complying with the requirements of this Act as to registration (see sections 9 to 13).
> 
> (2) A company may not be so formed for an unlawful purpose.

s 20 CA 2006 provides that the [[Articles of Association]] of a 2006 Act company are to be those set out in model Articles created by statutory instrument, except to the extent the [[Business Law and Practice/Company Fundamentals/Shareholders]] substitute their own Articles. There is one set of model Articles for private limited [[companies]] and another for public limited [[companies]]. Both sets of model Articles are to be found in the Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008.

For pre-CA 2006 companies, the memorandum is an additional constitutional document. In the Memorandum of Association you will also find a clause called the ‘authorised share capital clause’. This states: the maximum number of shares into which ownership of the company could be subdivided; and the face value of each share, known as the ‘nominal’ or ‘par’ value. This figure is significant – for example, it is unlawful under the Companies Act 2006 for a company to charge less than the nominal value when it issues new [[shares]].

s 28 CA 2006 provides that such provisions are to be treated as if they were contained in the company’s Articles of Association. That is, they are implied into the Articles of Association.

When a company is formed:

- The company has separate legal personality;
- The members of a limited company have limited liability.
	- There is a limit on the amount of money a shareholder is liable to contribute to a limited company in insolvent liquidation. The extent of this liability is set out in section 74(2)(d) of the Insolvency Act 1986.

> [!statute] s 74(2)(d) IA 1986
> In the case of a company limited by shares, no contribution is required  
> from any member exceeding the amount (if any) unpaid on the shares in  
> respect of which he is liable as a present or past member.

## Separate Personality

Although forming a company by registration without the need for a royal charter or Act of Parliament had been permitted since the Joint Stock Companies Registration Act of 1844, it was only following the decision of the House of Lords in [[Salomon v A Salomon & Co ltd [1897] AC 22]] that the full extent of this principle was realised. The House of Lords held in its judgment that the company’s acts were its own acts, not those of Mr Salomon personally.

- A company owns its own property, and it does not belong to the members (i.e., owners) of the company.
	- If the member were to insure the company’s property, the insurance would not be valid and the insurer would not have to pay up if a claim was made, even if that member owned the whole company ([[Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd [1925] AC 619]]).
- The company will enter into contracts with third parties and incur contractual rights/ obligations
- A company is able to borrow money and give security over its assets.
	- There is nothing to stop a company from borrowing money from its members, or indeed its [[directors]].
- Company can incur debts in its own name.
- If the company is wound up and comes to an end (e.g., because it can no longer pay its debts), under s 74(2)(d) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986) any unpaid amount of the nominal value of the shares may be claimed from the members. Any unpaid amount therefore represents the extent of the members’ liability.
- A company may sue and be sued in its own name.
- A company may even be prosecuted for manslaughter in its own right under the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007.
- A company as a separate legal person has its own lifespan independent of those who own or run it.
- A company is taxed separately from the members and director.
- As a separate legal person a company is also entitled to certain protections under the Human Rights Act 1998

### Division of Responsibility

- Workers are employees.
- Members are owners.
	- In a company limited by shared, the members are known as shareholders.
	- “Member” rather than “shareholder” used in CA 2006
- Directors run the company day-to-day
	- Take daily decisions such as entering into contracts

> [!statute] s 112 CA 2006
> (1) The subscribers of a company’s memorandum are deemed to have  
> agreed to become members of the company, and on its registration  
> become members and must be entered as such in its register of  
> members.  
> (2) Every other person who agrees to become a member of a company,  
> and whose name is entered in its register of members, is a member of  
> the company.

### Group of [[Companies]]

A company can own property in its own name, and this property includes shares in another company. This leads to structures of groups of companies, with parents and subsidiaries. This is sensible risk management.

#### Case Law

In [[Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433]], the claimants for asbestos-related illnesses were unable to bring proceedings against a parent company as they worked for one of the parent’s subsidiary companies. This was the case even though the subsidiary company had gone insolvent. However, in what may be a shift of emphasis, in [[Chandler v Cape plc [2012] EWCA 525 CA]], a parent company was held liable for the asbestos-induced illness of an employee of its subsidiary company. The Court of Appeal established a number of principles for deciding the circumstances in which a parent company will be liable for the subsidiary’s actions in health and safety matters. It seems as if such liability could extend to other areas, for example environmental liability. (see GDL notes).

## Separate Legal Personality Workarounds

The consequences that flow from the principle of separate legal personality can be problematic (e.g., evasion of responsibilities, tax avoidance).

### Giving a Guarantee

Banks can side-step separate legal personality by using contract law and asking for a personal guarantee from the entrepreneur for a loan to a business.

### Corporate Veil

There are exceptional circumstances in which statute or case law ‘pierces’, or ‘lifts’ or ‘looks behind’ this corporate veil.

The corporate veil is lifted only in exceptional and limited circumstances, when all other, more conventional, remedies have proved to be of no assistance ([[Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] 2 AC 415]]).

The courts will usually look behind the veil only in cases of fraud or deliberate breach of trust, eg where companies are used to carry out fraud ([[Re Darby, ex p Brougham [1911] 1 KB 95]]) or to avoid existing obligations ([[Gilford Motor Co Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch 935]]). The courts seem to ignore the principle of separate legal personality in these cases in order to ensure that an appropriate remedy is available against individuals who have committed a wrong using a company that they control. The Supreme Court has held, however, that even where fraud may exist, it will not pierce the veil in order to hold a person controlling a company liable as a joint contracting party for a contract which the company, and not the controller, has entered into ([[VTB Capital plc v Nutritek International Corp and others [2013] UKSC 5]]).

### Single Economic Unit

A group of companies may be used to lessen the risks of a business failure by taking advantage of separate legal personality. Previous decisions ignoring separate legal personality among groups are quite controversial and currently thought to be specific to their facts (i.e., wrong).

Nevertheless, there are statutory rules which apply to groups of companies and treat them as if they are a single economic unit rather than entirely separate legal persons.

- s 399 of the CA 2006 requires certain parent companies to prepare accounts for their groups of companies as if they were single companies, one aim being to ensure that shareholders of the parent company get to see the true financial state of their company.
- There is also special tax treatment of groups of companies to reflect the fact that, although comprising separate legal entities, they are usually run together.

### Liability of Directors

Directors are liable for their involvement in running a company (e.g., [[wrongful trading]]). But strictly this is not side-stepping separate legal personality: affirms it by making the director pay to the separate legal person, the company.

## Other Principles

### Transparency

Companies are required to make a large amount of information available to the public, including:

- (a) the identity of the company’s shareholders, and the number and type of shares that they own;
- (b) the identity and certain personal information about the company’s directors;
- (c) the identity of the company secretary (if any);
- (d) the company’s constitution (the internal rules which govern how the company should be run).
- (e) the company’s accounts; and
- (f) certain decisions taken by the shareholders.

Designed to help third parties in deciding whether to deal with the company.

#### Records

- CA 2006 requires that this information must be sent, usually using a prescribed form, to the Registrar of Companies at Companies House.
- Companies House is an agency of the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).
- The information is stored on a register kept at Companies House in accordance with s 1080 CA 2006.
- The Registrar of Companies is designated under s 1061 CA 2006 as having responsibility for keeping this register.

### Maintenance of Capital

> [!defn]
> The money invested by shareholders in a company is known as share capital.

It is a fundamental rule of company law that the share capital belongs to the company and not to the shareholders. The share capital is treated as a special fund within the company and

given extra protection by the law. This is so that it is available to repay the company’s creditors should the company be unable to pay its debts. This is the maintenance of capital principle – that a reserve of money, the share capital, is maintained within the company, to be available for creditors as a last resort.

Its effects are most clearly demonstrated in s 830 CA 2006. This provision allows a company to make distributions to its shareholders only out of distributable profits. Put simply, a company can pay money to its shareholders only from available profits, which do not touch the share capital.

> [!note]
> Most private companies have a share capital of £100 or less.
