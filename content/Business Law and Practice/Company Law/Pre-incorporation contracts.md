# Pre-incorporation contracts

A company comes into existence at the time of issue of certificate of incorporation by the Registrar of Companies ([s 16 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/16)). Until this time, not a legal person, so has no capacity to enter contracts ([[Rover International Ltd v Cannon Film Sales (No 3) [1987] BCLC 540]]).

Negotiations for contracts may commence at the same time that formation of a new company is being considered. If a contract entered into before the company is incorporated, then not possible for the company to have legal rights or duties under the contract because it had no legal capacity at that point.

[[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]], which allows third parties to enforce contracts where the contract expressly provides (or a term in the contract confers) a benefit on the third party, does **not** apply to pre-incorporation contracts.

## S 51 CA 2006

[s 51 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/51) seeks to protect third parties who believe they are entering a contract with a company which is incorporated and registered by making pre-incorporation contracts enforceable as personal contracts against 'promoters' (persons purporting to act on the company's behalf):

> (1) A contract that purports to be made by or on behalf of a company at a time when the company has not been formed has effect, subject to any agreement to the contrary, as one made with the person purporting to act for the company or as agent for it, and he is personally liable on the contract accordingly.

Need to check facts to see if there was an express agreement that the signatory would not be personally bound by the contract ([[Phonogram Ltd v Lane [1982] QB 938]]).

Cases for interpretation of s51:

In [[Hepburn v Revenue and Customs Commissioners [2013] UKFTT 445]] court applied 'subject to any agreement to the contrary' proviso.

In [[Royal Mail Estates Ltd v Teesdale [2015] EWHC 1890]] judge again considered spirit of s51 rather than letter of law.

## Ratification?

A company **cannot ratify** a contract made before it came into existence, since this is only possible for acts which a company could have authorised at the time. So not able to retrospectively authorise purported agents ([[Kelner v Baxter (1866) LR 2 CP]]).

A company can obtain the benefit of a contract purportedly made on its behalf before it came into existence by novating the contract ([[Natal Land Co & Colonization Ltd v Pauline Colliery and Development Syndicate Ltd [1904] AC 120 PC]]).

Where a company is formed from an existing shelf company, s 51 does not apply. This is because the company which enters into the contract is already formed and is a legal person, even though the name and details are later changed. So an individual involved in negotiation of contract between shelf company and third party not personally liable ([[Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc v Dan Marbel Inc Ltd [1989] BCL 507]]).

## Liability of the Promoter

A person purporting to act as an agent of a company which is not yet incorporated will be liable under the contract (s 51 CA 2006) but can also enforce that contract (both the obligations and the rights under that contract conferred on the agent). See [[Braymist Ltd v Wise Finance Co Ltd [2002]]].
