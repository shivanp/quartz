# Voidable Transactions

## Introduction

IA 1986 gives both a liquidator and an administrator the ability to challenge certain transactions that have taken place within specified statutory periods prior to company insolvency. These are known as 'voidable'/ 'antecedent' transactions.

The aim of a challenge is to restore the company to the same position it would have been in had the transaction not taken place, and thereby, increase the funds available to the insolvent estate for the benefit of creditors.

Known as 'clawback' provisions, since they can result in an order reversing transactions, or provision for financial restitution to be paid. The beneficiary of the transaction with the insolvent company is the target of the proceedings, rather than the directors responsible for entering the transaction.

## Types

Four different voidable transactions may be challenged by either a liquidator or administrator under relevant provisions of IA 1986:

1. Transactions at an undervalue ([s 238 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/238))
2. Transactions defrauding creditors ([s 423 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/238))
3. Preferences ([s 239 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/238))
4. Avoidance of floating charges ([s 245 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/238))

## Challenging Voidable Transactions

A liquidator or administrator seeking to challenge any voidable transaction (except for a transaction defrauding creditors under s 423) will need to ask the following questions in each case:

1. Did the transaction involve a ‘connected person’ or ‘associate’?
2. Did the transaction take place within the ‘relevant time’?
3. Was the company insolvent at the time of the transaction, or did it become insolvent as a result of the transaction?
4. Is there a presumption available which shifts the burden of proof from the liquidator/administrator to the other party?

## Transactions by a Company at an Undervalue (TUV)

The provisions under s 238 concern loss of value from a company, whether through gifts or a significant inequality in consideration, to the company's detriment, where the company is insolvent.

Insolvency here means 'inability to pay debts under s 123', i.e., either on a cash flow or balance sheet basis. Note, this is a wider definition than 'insolvency' for [[Wrongful trading]] purposes.

### Bringing a Claim

A claim may be brought under s 238(1) by:

- A liquidator
- An administrator

A transaction at an undervalue is either (s 238(4)):

1. A gift
2. A transaction for a consideration the value of which, in money or money's worth, is significantly less in value than the consideration provided by the company.

This involves a monetary comparison between what the company gave away and what it received under the transaction.

### Granting security/ Payment of a Dividend

It was generally thought that the granting of security by a company cannot amount to a transaction at an undervalue on the basis that the security does not itself deplete the assets of the company/ diminish their value ([[Re MC Bacon Ltd [1990] BCLC 324]]).

But then in [[Hill v Spread Trustee Company Limited [2006] EWCA Civ 542]] it was found that the granting of security for no consideration can be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue.

So the law is now uncertain given the differences in views between these cases.

Similar uncertainty exists around whether a dividend, lawfully paid, could amount to a transaction at any undervalue. [[BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA & others [2019] EWCA Civ 112]] suggests that a dividend can be attacked as a transaction at an undervalue.

### When and How Can the Transaction Be Avoided

The court may set aside a transaction as a transaction at an undervalue if:

- The company made a gift or otherwise entered into a transaction for a consideration, the value of which in money or money’s worth is significantly less in value than the consideration provided by the company.
- It took place within the ‘relevant time’ (s 238(2)) – in the **two years** preceding the onset of insolvency (s 240(1)(a)), which is the commencement of the relevant insolvency procedure (administration or [[Liquidation]]) (s 240(3)). Note that the relevant time is two years, regardless of whether the transaction took place with a connected person or not.
- It is proved by the applicant that the company was **insolvent** at the time of the transaction or became so as a result of it (s 240(2)). Where a transaction at an undervalue is entered into with a person connected with the company, insolvency is presumed unless the connected person proves otherwise (s 240(2)).
	- Here connected person means director/shadow director, or an associate.
- Sections 249 and 435 set out the definitions of ‘connected persons’ and ‘associates’ respectively.

### Defences

No order will be made to set aside the transaction if the court is satisfied that:

1. The company entered into the transaction in **good faith** and for the purpose of carrying on its business; and
2. At the time there were **reasonable grounds** for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.

This is often relied on in practice.

### Sanctions

The court has a **discretion** to make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position as if the company had not entered the transaction (s 238(3)).

s 241(1): provides a non-exhaustive list of the types of restoration order that the court might make under s 238 (and under s 239 in relation to voidable preference).

Any such order should not prejudice a subsequent purchaser from the party which transacted at an undervalue with (or received a preference from) the company, provided they were acting 'in good faith and for value' (s 241(2)).

But under s 241(2A) there is a rebuttable presumption that an acquisition by a subsequent purchaser was **not** in good faith, where the subsequent purchaser either:

- Had notice of the relevant surrounding circumstances (i.e., the transaction at an undervalue or preference) and of the relevant proceedings; or
- Was connected with or was an associate of either the company or the party which transacted at an undervalue with (or received a preference from) the company.

In such circumstances, the burden of proof shifts to the subsequent purchaser to show good faith.

## Transactions Defrauding Creditors (TDC)

Such claims can be made under [s 423 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/423). These claims do not necessarily relate to insolvency, can also be brought by a victim of the transaction in question where the company is solvent.

Requirements for the claim:

1. There has been a transaction at an undervalue
2. The intention/ purpose of the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach of creditors of the company, or otherwise prejudice their interests

Then this transaction can be avoided under s 423(3). This includes future creditors who were unknown at the time of transaction.

Insolvency practitioners may prefer to bring claims under s 238 (TUV) rather than s 423. Under s 238, it need not be proved that the purpose of the transaction was to put the assets beyond the reach of creditors, or otherwise prejudice them.

Where the challenge is made by an administrator or liquidator, it may therefore be easier to establish the claim under s 238, assuming that the claim satisfies the criteria for challenging an undervalue transaction under the above sections (i.e. ‘relevant time’ and insolvency).

### Who Can Claim

An application to the court to set aside the transaction can be made by any of the following (s 424):

1. A liquidator or an administrator;
2. A supervisor of a voluntary arrangement; or
3. A victim of the transaction in question.

There is **no** ‘relevant time’ or period within which the transaction must have taken place. However, generally speaking, the more recent the transaction, the more likely it is that the applicant will be able to show the necessary intent.

The court may make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been but for the transaction in question (s 423(2)). A non-exhaustive list of orders is set out in s 425(1).

The main advantage of a claim under s 423 is that it does not face the risk of becoming time-barred in the same way as a claim under s 238.

## Preferences by a Company

The purpose of [s 239 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/239) is to prevent a creditor obtaining an improper advantage over other creditors of a company, at a time when the company is insolvent. A claim may be brought under s 239(1) by:

- A liquidator
- An administrator.

The company gives preference to a person if:

- That person is a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor of any of the company’s debts or liabilities); and
- The company does anything or allows anything to be done which has the effect of putting that person in a better position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than he/she would otherwise have been in.

### When Can Preference Be Avoided

The preference is voidable if:

- It was given within the ‘relevant time’ (s 239(2)) – in the **6 months** preceding the ‘onset of insolvency’ (s 240(1)(b)), being the commencement of the relevant insolvency procedure (s 240(3)). The relevant time is extended to **2 years** for preferences to connected persons and associates (s 240(1)(a)). (See sections 249 and 435 for definitions of ‘connected persons’ and ‘associates’).
- It is proved that the company was insolvent (on either a cash flow or balance sheet basis) at the time of the transaction or became so as a result of it (s 240(2)).
- It is proved that the company was ‘influenced … by a desire’ to prefer the creditor (s 239(5)). This is a **subjective** test (as opposed to an intention to prefer, which is objective). The company must have positively wished to put the party in a better position ([[Re MC Bacon Ltd [1990] BCLC 324]]).

Here there is no statutory presumption of knowledge of insolvency where the preference is given to a person who is connected with the company (in contrast to TUV).

### Connected Persons

If the preference is given to a [[connected person]] or [[associate]], there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was influenced by the desire to protect the creditor (s 239(6)). This shifts the burden of proof from the liquidator or administrator to the preferred person to rebut the statutory presumption.

So it is for the preferred person to rebut this presumption.

### Defences

The defence available is an absence of the desire to prefer, required by s 239(5).

### Sanctions

The court has a discretion to make an order to restore the position as if the company had not given the preference (s 239(3)).

Section 241(1) provides a non-exhaustive list of the types of restoration order that the court may make.

Note that s 241(2) and s 241(2A) apply to both preferences and transactions at an undervalue.

## When Can Floating Charges Be Avoided

For the floating charge to be invalid:

- Must have been created within the 'relevant time'
	- This is **12 months** preceding the onset of insolvency (i.e., commencement of administration or liquidation (s 245(2) & 245(3)(b))
	- Relevant time is extended to **two years** in the case of a floating charge granted to a connected person (s 245(3)(a)).
- Unless the floating charge was granted to a 'connected person' or 'associate', it must be proved that the company:
	- Was insolvent (on a cash flow or balance sheet basis) at the time of the floating charge's creation, or
	- Became insolvent as a consequence of the transaction under which the charge was created (s 245(4)).

### When Are New Floating Charges Valid

Even if the above requirements are met, a floating charge will be valid to the extent that 'new money' or other fresh consideration is provided to the company (or existing debts extinguished), in return for the grant of the floating charge on or after its creation (s 245(2)).

s 245(2) effect: if a floating charge is granted to secure the repayment of a new loan made on or after the creation of the charge, then it will be valid.

> [!example]
> 
> An example of when a floating charge would be void is where an existing unsecured creditor is granted a floating charge by a company which is insolvent and the charge purports to secure the repayment of existing monies owed to that creditor.
> 
> If s 245 did not apply, such an unsecured creditor would thereby improve its position in the order of priority if the company later went into an insolvency procedure, which would be unfair on the company’s other unsecured creditors. However, if (and to the extent that) an existing unsecured creditor provides further credit to the company (or to the extent that any other new credit is given by a new creditor) then that creditor is entitled to have the protection of a valid floating charge.

### Avoidance of Floating Charges

Where a floating charge is void under s 245, only the security (and its advantage to a floating charge creditor in the order of priority) is void, and not the debt itself. A floating charge is also void against the liquidator, administrator, and other creditors, if it is not duly registered with Companies House under [s 859H CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859H).

A floating charge granted to a creditor may also be voidable as a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, under s 238 and 239.
