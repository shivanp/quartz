# Appointment and removal of directors

No process for appointing directors specified under CA 2006, so will be governed by company Articles.

MA 17(1):

> Any person who is willing to act as a director, and is permitted by law to do so, may be appointed to be a director:  
> (a) by ordinary resolution of shareholders, or  
> (b) by decision of directors

Persons appointed as directors must consent to act as such (form AP01, sent to Companies House within 14 days). A register of directors must be kept at the company's registered office (s 162).

## Service Contracts

An executive director is an employee of the company, so should be given a written employment contract — a service contract. No automatic entitlement for directors to be paid for services.

- Company must keep copy of directors' service contracts/ memoranda of the terms ([s 228 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/228)).
- Shareholders have right to inspect copies of directors' service contracts/ memoranda ([s 229 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/229)), must be provided within 7 days of request.

### Long Term Service Contracts

- [Art 19 MA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#remuneration) means that terms of an individual director's service contract are for the board to determine. Only requires approval of resolution of board of directors, though shareholder approval required ([s 188 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/188)) to enter long-term service contracts (where service contract has guaranteed term which is or may be > 2 years).
- If shareholder approval not given, term incorporated into service agreement **void** under s 189(a) CA 2006. Additionally, under s 189(b) CA 2006, the service contract will be deemed to contain a term entitling company to terminate the contract at any time, by giving reasonable notice.

## Termination of Appointment

### Resignation

Subject to any provisions to the contrary in the articles, the director may resign at any time by giving notice ([[Glossop v Glossop [1907] 2 Ch 370]]). Resignation of director normally effective according to its terms and does not need specific board approval.

### Vacation of Office

MA 18: director automatically deemed to vacate office where that person becomes

- Prohibited from being a director
- Bankrupt
- Subject to composition order made with creditors
- Physically/mentally incapable for > 3 months

### Removal

[s 168 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/168): director can be removed by **ordinary resolution** of shareholders.

The director has the right to be heard at General Meeting ([s 169 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/169)) in which the ordinary resolution is to be decided. So written resolutions cannot be used. Special notice of such a resolution must be given — 28 days before.

Directors who are shareholders allowed to vote in their capacity as a shareholder on resolution to remove them.

Cases | Removing director
---|---
Cooperative board | The directors must call a board meeting using their powers under MA 9. At the BM they must, via a board resolution, call a General Meeting, using the powers conferred under s 302 CA 2006. The shareholders must give ‘special notice’ of a resolution to remove a director (s 168(2)). Special notice means that notice of the intention must be given to the company at least 28 days before the GM (s 312(1)). In calculating the notice period, the clear day rule applies (s 360); both the day on which notice is given and the day of the meeting are excluded. The director has a right to speak against their removal at the meeting and to make written representations to the shareholders in advance of the meeting (s 169). The company cannot use the written procedure method in this case (s 288(2)(a)).
Uncooperative board | If the board refuse to call a GM, they can be required to do so if members representing more than 5% of the paid-up share capital request it (s 303 notice). This must state the general nature of the business which shareholders wish to be dealt with at the general meeting. The board must call the GM within 21 days of the request, and the meeting must be held within 28 days of the notice (s 304(1)). If the board still refuse to call a GM, the members who made the request may call the GM themselves, if more than half of them agree to do so (s 305(1)). The GM must then be held within 3 months of the request (s 305(3)). The ordinary resolution to remove a director can then be voted on.

Upon receiving a shareholder request on the directors of a company to call a general meeting in order to move an ordinary resolution to remove one of the directors, the directors have to pass a board resolution at a board meeting to call the general meeting. But this can be done on reasonable notice ([[Brown v La Trinidad (1887) 37 Ch. D. 1]]).

#### Bushell V Faith

Possible for company to insert a 'Bushell v Faith' clause into its articles: see [[Bushell v Faith [1970] AC 1099 (House of Lords)]]. These give weighted voting rights, allowing director/ shareholders to block such resolutions.

Might seem contrary to s 168 CA 2006. But such weighted voting clauses allowed because requirement for ordinary resolution not changed, just that way votes are amassed make it easier for director/ shareholder to survive. They represent an internal agreement amongst shareholders as to the weight their vote carries on a specific resolution.

### Disqualification

**Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (CDDA 1986)** outlines circumstances in which directors can be disqualified.

```ad-defn
title: s 1(1) CDDA 1986

Where a person is disqualified, they shall not, without the leave of the court, “be a director of a company, or a liquidator or administrator of a company, or be a receiver or manager of a company's property, or, in any way, whether directly or indirectly, be concerned or take part in the promotion, formation or management of a company, for a specified period beginning with the date of the order.”
```

#### Mandatory Disqualification

Under s 6(1) CDDA 1986, a mandatory disqualification order can last between 2 and 15 years. Order made when court satisfied:

> (a) that he is or has been a director of a company which has at any time become insolvent (whether while he was a director or subsequently), and  
> (b) that his conduct as a director of that company (either taken alone or taken together with his conduct as a director of any other company or companies) makes him unfit to be concerned in the management of a company.

Taken by courts to mean director has abused privilege of limited liability in some way, by gross negligence or deliberate disregard of creditors' interests (e.g., [[Secretary of Trade and Industry v Blunt (2005)]])

#### Discretionary Disqualification

Can last up to 10/15 years. Grounds for disqualification can include:

- Conviction of an indictable offence in connection with the management of the company or company property ([s 2 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/2))
- Persistent breaches of company legislation requiring returns or notices to be given to Registrar ([s 3 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/3))
- Fraud ([s 4 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/4))
	- Either fraudulent trading under [s 993 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/993)
	- Wrongful/ fraudulent trading under s 213 & s 214 Insolvency Act 1986, or
	- Fraud in relation to the company or its property
- Disqualification after investigation of company — where it seems to the Secretary of State that it would be in the public interest for a disqualification order to be made ([s 8 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/8)).
	- e.g., this happened in [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills v Pawson (2015)]]

### Criminal Penalties

It is a criminal offence to act in contravention of a disqualification order. Any person doing so is liable for a fine or imprisonment or both ([s 13 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/13)). Also, personally liable for debts of the company incurred during the time that person was acting in contravention of disqualification order ([s 15 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/15)).

### Compensation Orders

The Secretary of State may apply to court for a compensation order against a director who has been disqualified, where creditors have suffered losses due to the director's misconduct (s 15 A-C).

### Disqualification Undertakings

The Secretary of State may accept a disqualification undertaking by any person that, for a specified period, that person will not be a director or be involved in any way with the promotion, formation, or management of a company without leave of the court (s 6(2)).

Directors who breach competition law may also be disqualified under s 9A-E CDDA 1986 for up to 15 years. Disqualification undertakings may be offered in this situation. Potential immunity for whistle-blowers.
