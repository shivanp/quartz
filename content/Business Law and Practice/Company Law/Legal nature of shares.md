# Legal nature of shares

3 aspects to a share:

1. Financial stake in the company
2. Interest in the company
3. Property right

A share is described as a bundle of rights. Sets out the shareholder's financial stake in the company, allowing the shareholder to receive dividends and capital on a winding up.

It is a property right which can be bought and sold. No formal definition in CA 2006, but [s 541 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/541) confirms that shares are personal property.

Share ownership does not give entitlement to the ownership of company assets, which are owned by the company itself ([[Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd [1925] AC 619]]).

## Becoming a Shareholder

- Initial subscriber
	- Buying shares when first issued
- Share issue
	- Acquire further shares issued by the company after incorporation
- Share transfer
	- A transfer from an existing shareholder
- Transmission
	- Title to shares devolved by a mechanism other than transfer.
	- Devolution by death (succession/ inheritance), bankruptcy or marriage.
	- On registration of transmission of shares, the person entitled becomes the shareholder. Necessary documents need to be forwarded to the company.

### Register of Members

[s 112 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/112): in order to become a member of a company, a person must be entered into the company's register of members. This rule was strictly upheld in [[Glencoe Developments Ltd v Sneddon [2012] ]].

Member's register ensures that nobody other than a company member can vote on decisions affecting the company. Transfer of shares should only be recorded when a stock transfer form has been competed and appropriate Stamp Duty paid.

Not keeping an up-to-date register is an offence under CA 2006: company and every officer in default can be fined.

### Allotment of Shares

Contract between the company and new/existing shareholder in which the company agrees to issue new shares in return for the purchaser paying the subscription price.

The powers of directors to allot shares derives from [s 549-551 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/549). Shares are allotted when a person acquires the **unconditional right** to be included in the company's register of members in respect to those shares ([s 558 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/558)). Note, allotment of shares confers equitable title only.

### Issue of Shares

No statutory definition, but held that shares are issued and form part of a company's issued share capital once:

- The shareholder has actually been registered as such in the company's register of members, and
- His title has become complete

[s 112(2) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/112) confirms that full legal title to shares is only achieved once a person's name is entered into the company's register of members. So basically this is the key.

### Transfer of Shares

A contract to sell existing shares in a company between an existing shareholder and the purchaser. The company is not a party to the contract.

Under [s 544 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/544), shares are freely transferrable in principle. But the articles of most private companies restrict their members' rights to transfer their shares, to preserve ownership. Private companies cannot offer shares to the public ([s 755 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/755)).
