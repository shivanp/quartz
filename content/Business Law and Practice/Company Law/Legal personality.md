# Legal personality

## Limited Liability

> Shareholders' liability for debts and liabilities of the company is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on their shares.

[s 74 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/74): shareholders of a limited company are generally speaking not liable to a liquidator in company insolvency.

Also, possible to incorporate unlimited liability companies, and note limitations to limited liability doctrine.

Helpful for:

- Attracting passive investment
- Attractive for entrepreneurs
- Developing groups of companies
	- Riskier business divisions conducted through separate companies within the group

## Separate Personality

Directors owe their duties to the company, not the shareholders. Third parties contract with the company.

Seminal case: [[Salomon v A Salomon & Co ltd [1897] AC 22]].

Number of consequences of this perspective:

### 1. Company Owns Its Own Property

Property of a company belongs to the company itself and not to shareholders. See [[Macaura v Northern Assurance Co Ltd [1925] AC 619]]

### 2. Company Enters into Its Own Contracts

Enters into contracts on its own behalf, and benefits and liabilities under the contract belong to the company, not the shareholders or directors. True even where the contract is between a company and its sole director/ shareholder.

See [[Lee v Lee's Air Farming Ltd [1961] AC 12]].

### 3. Company Sues and is Sued on Its Own Liabilities

See [[Adams v Cape Industries plc [1990] Ch 433]].

[s 16 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/16) sets out that a company becomes a body corporate (a legal person) from the date of incorporation. A private limited company can be formed with just one director and one shareholder. The company will continue to exist when shareholders or directors change.

Shareholders have no entitlement to the company's property. Own property but don't have day to day control.

Directors have day to day control (MA 3).

## Justifications and Issues

- Encourages investment and encourages businesses to take risks
- s59, s60 CA 2006 says all company names must end with Ltd (private limited) or Plc (public limited)
- So creditors know what they're getting into â€“ can check financials at Companies House
- But risk unable to receive monies due to them since can't go behind the corporate structure to get money from those controlling the company. Accounts filed annually and kinda bad
