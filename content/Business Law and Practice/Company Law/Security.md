# Security

## Nature of Security

Security means temporary ownership, possession, or other proprietary interest in an asset to ensure that a debt is repaid (i.e., collateral for a debt).

The main benefit of taking security is to protect the creditor in the event that the borrower enters into a formal insolvency procedure. It is possible to improve the priority of a debt by taking security for it. Enforcing the security can be a simpler way of obtaining repayment than suing the borrower.

There are different types of security:

## Pledge

Security provider gives possession of the asset to the creditor, until the debt is paid back (e.g., pawning a watch)

## Lien

The creditor retains possession of the asset until the debt is paid back. Mechanic's lien allows a mechanic to retain possession of a repaired vehicle until the invoice is paid.

## Mortgage

Security provider retains possession of the asset, but transfers ownership to the creditor. Subject to the security provider's right to require the creditor to transfer the asset back to it when the debt is repaid. Right is known is the '[[equity of redemption]]'. A type of mortgage (known as charge by way of legal mortgage) is usually taken over land. Ownership will remain vested in the security provider in this case.

## Charge

Security provider retains possession of the asset. Rather than transferring ownership, this involves the creation of an equitable proprietary interest in the asset, in favour of the creditor.

As well as the equitable proprietary interest, the charging document will give the lender certain contractual rights over the asset. These often include the right to appoint a receiver/ administrator to take possession of the house and sell it, if the debt is not paid back. Two types of charge: fixed and floating charges.

Type of charge | Description
---|---
Fixed charge | Prevents the borrower from dealing with the assets subject to the charge. This is the strongest form of security.
Floating charge | 'Floats' over a class of assets. It does not prevent the borrower from dealing with these assets, unless and until the floating charge 'crystallises'. This usually happens when the borrower defaults on the loan repayments.

The label applied to a charge is not always determinative, necessary to look at the terms of the charge itself ([[Agnew v IRC [2001] 2 BCLC 188, PC]]). In more detail:

### Fixed Charge

Where a fixed charge is granted, the lender will control the borrower's use of the charged asset. The company cannot deal with the assets subject to the charge without the consent of the lender.

The creditor will usually prefer this, but it is not always appropriate. For instance, a fixed charge will not be applicable for stock/ raw materials which the borrower will need to use daily in the course of business. More likely to be taken over assets like plant and machinery.

If the charge becomes enforceable, the lender has the ability to appoint a receiver, and exercise a power of sale over the asset.

The prevention of the chargor from freely disposing of the asset is crucial to the creation of a fixed charge ([[Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd [2004] ]]).

### Floating Charges

Most companies are unable to grant fixed charges for the majority of their assets.

With a floating charge, whatever assets in a particular class that a borrower owns at any point in time are subject to the floating charge.

In [[Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association [1904] AC 355]], a floating charge was defined as

- A class of assets, present and future; and
- Which in the ordinary course of the company's business changes from time to time; and
- It is contemplated that until the holders of the charge take steps to enforce it, the company may carry on business in the ordinary way as far as concerns the assets charged.

### Crystallisation

When a floating charge crystallises, it ceases to float over all the assets in a class and instead fixes onto the assets in the class charged at the time of crystallisation. The lender then has control of these assets, and the borrower is unable to deal with them, as if the assets were subject to a fixed charge.

However, the assets subject to crystallisation of the floating charge are **not** treated as fixed charge assets for distribution purposes on a winding up.

If the company receives more assets of the same class after crystallisation, these are automatically subject to the crystallisation charge ([[NW Robbie and Co v Whitney Warehouse Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 1324, CA]]).

Crystallisation occurs:

1. In common law, on a winding up, appointment of a receiver or cessation of business
2. Specified event — as defined in the loan agreement. This usually occurs where a borrower defaults on the loan repayments or interest payments, or where another lender enforces their security.

### Charges Over Book Debts

Book debt is an unpaid invoice, i.e., a sum owed to the company in respect of goods or services supplied by it.

Book debts are a fluctuating asset, and may be a significant asset of the company.

In early cases, the courts took the approach that a charge granted over book debts was a fixed charge, but this approach has now been overruled.

Case | Authority
---|---
[[Siebe Gorman and Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142]] | The court held that a charge over book debts was a fixed charge because of the degree of control of the bank which could stop the company making withdrawals, even when the account was in credit. Since overruled.
[[Re Brightlife Ltd [1987] Ch 200 ChD]] | The court in this case clarified that a company's bank balance is not a book debt and therefore cannot be subject to a fixed charge.
[[Re Keenan Bros Ltd [1986] BCLC 242]] | A fixed charge was created by the means of a requirement that the funds collected by the company were to be paid into a blocked account. The prior written consent of the bank was required before any funds were allowed to be withdrawn from this account. Here the court said that the charge was a fixed charge due to the fact that the account was blocked.
[[Re Brumark Investments Ltd [2001] ]] | The company's freedom to collect and use the proceeds of the book debts as it wished without requiring the lender's consent was inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge. This was a Privy Council case, which means that it is persuasive but not binding.

Eventually, the position was resolved in [[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41]]. It is now very difficult to demonstrate the requisite level of control over book debts for a fixed charge. It would require at least a blocked account.

> [!important] Charge over book debts
> 
> From the case of [[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41]] it is only possible to have a fixed charge over book debts if they are paid into a blocked account which gives the lender the degree of control required.

## Guarantees

Guarantees are not securities strictly, since they do not give rise to assets. But their commercial effect is similar to security.

A guarantee for a loan means an agreement that the guarantor will pay the borrower's debt if the borrower fails to do so.

> [!example]
> 
> A Bank is intending to lend £20,000 to a company which was recently incorporated by an entrepreneur who is the majority shareholder in the company and is its managing director. The bank will be granted a fixed charge over certain assets.
> 
> However, the bank is concerned that the value of the assets might depreciate rapidly, leaving it exposed. As the company is newly incorporated, it may not have substantial assets. The Bank could also look to take a personal guarantee from the entrepreneur if they have valuable assets. If the company defaulted, the bank could call on the guarantee and, if the entrepreneur refused to pay, sue them for the money. They may also give security for the loan (eg by granting a mortgage over their home, subject to any rights of any other person living there with them).

## Liquidation Priority

In liquidation, a company's assets fall into two categories: those subject to fixed charges, and those subject to floating charges.

**Fixed charge holders are paid first**, and are entitled to the whole of their debt from the fixed charge fund. If there is a shortfall, they may receive assets from the floating charge fund.

 The insolvency rules require a proportion of the floating charge assets to be set aside for the unsecured creditors. In addition, preferential debts (those payable to employees) are also paid out of the floating charge fund before the floating charge holders are paid. The unsecured creditors are paid after the floating charge holders, and any remaining assets are paid to the shareholders.

 

 Order of repayment

 ```mermaid
 graph TD
 id1(Fixed charge creditors) --> id2("Preferential debts (paid out of floating charge fund)")
 id2 --> id3("Floating charge creditors (minus a proportion to be set aside for unsecured creditors) ")
 id3 --> id4(Unsecured creditors)
 id4 --> id5(Shareholders)
 ```

 Most banks therefore require a fixed charge and floating charge, giving themselves the greatest chance to recoup their money if the company goes into liquidation.

 

## Registration of Charges

 

 All charges created on or after 6 April 2013 must be registered at Companies House.

 
 - [s 859A(4) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859A) states that the charge must be registered within 21 days beginning with **the day after the date of creation** of the charge. Any person interested in the charge may complete the registration formalities (usually done by the lender).
 - If the charge is not registered within the 21-day period, under [s 859H(3) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859H), the charge is void as against a liquidator, administrator, or creditor of the company and the debt becomes immediately payable. This means that the holder of the charge is reduced to an unsecured creditor. It is therefore crucial to register the security on time so that it is enforceable in priority to other creditors.
 - Certified copies of all charges must be kept at the company’s registered office ([s 859P CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859P)).

### Remedial Measures in the Case of Non-registration

Under [s 859F CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859F), the court has the power to extend the period for registration where the grounds of s 859F(2) are met:

>(a) that the failure to deliver those documents-  
>(i) was accidental or due to inadvertence or to some other sufficient cause, or  
>(ii) is not of a nature to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders of the company, or  
>(b) that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief.

The court will allow the register to be rectified provided this does not prejudice any other charges created between the date of creation of the unregistered charge and the date of eventual registration ([[Barclays Bank plc v Stuart Landon Ltd [2001] 2 BCLC 316]]).

The court has also refused to allow a charge to be registered late, where the time elapsed is too long ([[Victoria Housing Estates Ltd v Ashpurton Estates Ltd [1982]]]).
