# Class rights

[s 630 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/629):

> Shares are of one class if the rights attached to them are in all respects uniform.

[MA 22](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#differentclasses) gives companies the power to issue different classes of share.

==The label attached to a share is not determinative.== The rights attached to a class of shares are determined in the company's articles.

## Classes

Common types:

- Ordinary shares
- Redeemable shares
- Preference shares
- Non-voting shares
- Employees' shares
- Cumulative shares
- Convertible shares
- Deferred shares

### Ordinary Shares

These are the default position and most common. Carry a right to vote in general meetings, a right to receive a dividend if one is declared by the directors, and a right to receive a share of the capital when a company is wound up.

Defined in [s 560(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/560) as

> shares other than shares that as respects dividends and capital carry a right to participate only up to a specified amount in a distribution.

The negative definition illustrates that ordinary shares are the default position and are shares that have an unlimited right to participate in dividends and surplus capital when a company is wound up.

### Preference Shares

Shares usually entitled to have dividends paid at a predetermined rate, in priority to any dividend paid on ordinary shares.

Dividends can only be paid where the company has distributable profits and a dividend is declared.

Preference shares often have a right to priority over the ordinary shareholders when capital is returned to the members in a winding up. Rights of preference shareholders may be **cumulative** (arrears of preference dividends not declared in earlier years must be paid before ordinary shareholders are paid) or **non-cumulative** (only current year's dividend payable).

May be **participating**, meaning shareholders can also participate in a dividend or capital on a winding up alongside ordinary shareholders. This means they receive both their fixed preferential dividend or a fraction of capital, plus a fraction of the general dividend/ capital in accordance with their shareholding.

### Deferred Shares

Shares normally only have a right to a dividend and/or return of capital after the claims of the preference shareholders and ordinary shareholders. Usually issued to the founders of a company, not very common.

### Redeemable Shares

Temporary shares, which may be bought back by the company at a future date. Governed by Chapter 3 [s 684-689 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/684).

### Non-voting Shares

Issued where company seeks to restrict control of the company

### Convertible Shares

May be converted to a different type of share in the issuing company, according to a pre-arranged formula set out in the articles.

### Employees' Shares

Employees' share schemes can have tax advantages. Usually ordinary shares with extra restrictions (e.g., on transfer).

> [!example]
> 
> **PGDL Limited** has **participating preference shares** in issue which carry a right to receive a fixed preferential dividend of 5% of the par value of the shares per annum. The shares have a par value of £1 each.
> 
> Assuming that a dividend has been declared, the preference shareholders would be entitled to receive a dividend of 5p per share per annum before the ordinary shareholders receive any dividend. They would then also be entitled to a fraction of the remaining general dividend alongside the ordinary shareholders.
> 
> **SQE Limited** has **non-participating preference shares** in issue which carry a right to receive a fixed preferential dividend of 5% of the total subscription price per share per annum. The shares have a par value of £1 each but were subscribed for at a price of £2 per share.
> 
> Assuming that a dividend has been declared, the preference shareholders would be entitled to receive a dividend of 10p per share per annum before the ordinary shareholders receive any dividend. They would not be entitled to any further dividend.

## Variation of Class Rights

Baseline presumption: all shares have equal rights, unless there is an express provision in the articles to the contrary ([[Birch v Cropper (1889) 14 App Cas 525]])

[s 630 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/630): class rights can only be varied

1. In accordance with the relevant provisions in the company's articles,
2. Or if there is no provision in the articles:
	- Where 75% in value of the shares of the affected class consent in writing,
	- Or a special resolution is passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the affected class of shares.

Companies can **entrench** class rights in their articles ([s 22 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/22)), and in this case the protection cannot be circumvented by changing the rights attached to shares under s 630.

Shareholders voting at a class meeting to vary rights must vote with the dominant purpose of benefitting the class as a whole, or the variation may be invalid ([[British America Nickel Corpn Ltd v O’Brien [1927] AC 369 (PC)]]).

### Exercise of Rights

Statutory provisions under s 630 apply only if the shareholders have “class rights” which are to be varied. Variations affecting the exercise of the rights, rather than the rights themselves, are not subject to s 630.

Issuing more shares of a particular class doesn't count as 'varying' the class rights, even through it may dilute the amount of dividend previously paid. The attitude is that the substantive legal rights of the class have not been altered, only the way in which these rights have been exercised.

Key case | Ratio
--- | ---
[[White v Bristol Aeroplane Co [1953] Ch 65 (Court of Appeal)]] | Issuing more shares is not varying class rights
[[House of Fraser plc v ACGE Investments Ltd [1987] AC 387]] | Cancelling a class of preference shares was not varying class rights, since this was consistent with the terms of issue of the shares.
[[Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd [1946] 1 All ER 512 (Court of Appeal)]] | Changing the rights of one class does not affect the class rights of another class.

### Right to Object

[s 633 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/663): dissenting members of a class of shares have a right to challenge a variation.

The conditions for this are:

1. Only shareholders holding $\geq 15\%$ of the issued shares of that class may challenge a variation, and
2. The variation must be challenged in court within 21 days of the date on which consent was given, or the resolution was passed, to vary the class rights.

Common law now indicates that a vote on a resolution to vary class rights must be exercised for a purpose/ dominant purpose of benefitting the class as a whole ([[British America Nickel Corpn Ltd v O’Brien [1927] AC 369]]) so this may be grounds for a challenge.
