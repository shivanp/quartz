# Duty to Exercise Independent Judgment

> [!statute] s 173 - Duty to exercise independent judgment
> (1) A director of a company must exercise independent judgment.
> (2) This duty is not infringed by his acting –
> - (a) in accordance with an agreement duly entered into by the company that restricts the future exercise of discretion by its directors, or
> - (b) in a way authorised by the company’s constitution.

Where the board is able to establish that it was in the best interests of the company to enter into an agreement which fetters the discretion of the directors, this will not be a breach of s 173.

The duty is a restatement of the previous fiduciary duty that a director must not fetter their own discretion.

## Cases

- [[Fulham Football Club Ltd v Cabra Estates plc [1994] 1 BCLC 363 (Court of Appeal)]]: directors have the right to enter into a contract on behalf of the company that may in future require the directors to act in a particular way, provided it is done in good faith in the interests of the company.
- [[Madoff Securities International Ltd v Raven [2013] EWHC 3147]]: directors must be mindful of the individual nature of their duties. Can't be dominated, bamboozled or manipulated.
