# Wrongful trading

## Rationale

Liability for wrongful trading is a much more recent innovation than the introduction of liability for [[fraudulent trading]]. It was introduced to address criticism of the ineffectiveness of the fraudulent trading provisions, given the high bar of proof required for such claims.

## Purpose

The purpose of wrongful trading liability is to ensure that directors become aware that when an insolvent [[Liquidation]]/ administration is inevitable, they are under a duty to take every step possible to minimise the potential losses to the company's creditors.

If they fail, the court can order the directors to contribute to the insolvent estate by way of compensation for the losses that the general body of creditors have suffered as a result. This will increase the funds available for distribution to the unsecured creditors upon insolvency.

Wrongful trading liability imposes a personal liability on directors, and is an exception to the principle of limited liability, under which those who run a company cannot be liable for its unpaid debts.

There is no requirement to show intent or dishonesty.

### Who May Bring a Claim

A civil claim for wrongful trading can be brought against a director by a liquidator ([s 214 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/214)) or an administrator ([s 246ZB IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/246ZB)). There are no criminal provisions for wrongful trading.

Wrongful trading is a major risk run by [[directors]] of a company trading on the brink of insolvency.

Administrators and liquidators can also now under [SBEEA 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/26/contents/enacted) assign wrongful trading claims to a third party as a way of raising funds for the insolvent estate and thereby avoid the risk of litigation.

### Against Whom Can a Claim Be Brought

Can be brought against any person who was at the relevant time a director.

This includes shadow directors (defined in [s 251 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/251)), de facto and non-executive directors ([[Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 180]]).

Recall that under fraudulent trading, a claim could be brought against any person who had the intention to commit a fraud.

## Requirements for Liability

```ad-tip
title:Wrongful Trading (s 214(2)/246ZB(2))

For a director to be liable for wrongful trading, the court must be satisfied that the company has gone into insolvent [[Liquidation]] or insolvent administration, and 
1. At some time before the commencement of the winding up or insolvent administration (for convenience, that time is referred to as the ‘point of no return’)
2. The director knew or ought to have concluded that
3. There was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent [[liquidation]] (or insolvent administration).
```

For these purposes, a company goes into insolvent liquidation/ administration at a time when its assets are insufficient for the payment of its debts and other liabilities, and the expenses of the winding up/ administration (s 214(6) / 246ZB(6)).

Insolvency for wrongful trading purposes is judged solely on the balance sheet test, not on the cash flow test ([s 214(6) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/214)).

### Continued Trading

It must be proven that the director in question allowed the company to continue trading during the period in which they knew/ ought to have known that there was no reasonable prospect that the company would avoid going into insolvent liquidation/ administration, and that the continued trading made the company's position worse ([[Re Continental Assurance Co of London plc [2001] BPIR 733]]).

But if the company has not reached 'the point of no return', then wrongful trading liability cannot arise. Only if this point has been reached should the defence below be considered.

[[Re Produce Marketing Consortium Ltd [1989] BCLC 513, ChD]]: there is an obligation laid on [[companies]] to keep accounting records which disclose with **reasonable accuracy** the financial position of the company. This minimum standard holds regardless of the size of the company, though a higher standard will be imposed for larger companies.

## The 'every Step' Defence

This defence is laid out in s 214(3) / 246ZB(3).

Assuming the company has reached the point of no return, a director may be able to escape liability if they can satisfy the court that, after they first knew/ ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding an insolvent administration/ liquidation, they took every step with a view to minimising the potential loss to the company's creditors.

Evidence of this:

- Voicing concerns at board meetings;
- Seeking independent financial/ legal advice;
- Ensuring adequate, up-to-date financial information was available;
- Suggesting reductions in overheads/liabilities;
- Not incurring further credit; and
- Consulting a lawyer and/or an insolvency practitioner for advice on continued trading and the different insolvency procedures.

The burden of proof for this is on the directors: [[Brooks v Armstrong [2015] EWHC 2289]].

## Reasonably Diligent Person Test

The 'reasonably diligent person' test (s 214(4) / 246ZB(4)) is applied to determine:

- Whether a liquidator or administrator has established that a director ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation or administration (the s 214(2) / 246ZB(2) liability), and
- Whether the director then took every step to minimise the potential loss to the company’s creditors (the s 214(3) / 246ZB(3) defence).

Test:

- The facts which a director ought to have known or ascertained,
- The conclusions which they ought to have reached and
- The steps which they ought to have taken are those which would have been known or ascertained, or reached or taken, by a reasonably diligent person having both:
	- The general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by the director in question (an objective test); and
	- The actual knowledge, skill and experience of that particular director (a subjective test).

The court then applies the **higher** of these standards.

## Advice to Directors

- Directors should hold board meetings to review the company's financial position, and consider whether it is appropriate to incur new credit/ liabilities.
- Minutes of each meeting should be written up.
- Lawyers advising a company often take an active role in helping directors to prepare minutes and ensure that board meetings consider all relevant issues.
- A director cannot escape liability by simply resigning, since a claim for wrongful trading can be brought against any person who was a director at the relevant time ([[Re Purpoint Ltd [1991] BCLC 491]]).
- The best course of action is for the company to seek professional advice as soon as possible ([[Re Continental Assurance Co of London plc [2001] BPIR 733]]).
- But the absence of warnings from advisors does not relieve directors of the responsibility to review the company's position critically ([[Re Brian D Pierson (Contractors) Ltd [2001] 1 BCLC]]).

## Remedies

If a director is found liable for wrongful trading, the court can order that director to make such contribution to the assets of the company as the court thinks fit.

The court has wide discretion to determine the extent of the directors' liability. The contribution will ordinarily be based on the additional depletion of the company's assets caused by the directors' conduct from the date that the directors ought to have concluded that the company could not have avoided an insolvent administration/ liquidation (i.e., the point of no return).

### Apportioning Contributions

An order by the court for a director to contribute to the company's assets is compensatory, not penal. An order to contribute can be made against the directors on a joint and several basis. But the court also has discretion to apportion liability between directors based on culpability by ordering the more culpable directors to pay less.

Where the court makes a contribution order against a director, the court also has discretion to make a disqualification order against them under [s 10 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/10).

### No Relief

Under [s 1157 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1157) the court may ordinarily relieve a director from liability in proceedings for negligence, breach of duty or breach of trust, if it is satisfied that they acted honestly and reasonably. And having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the director ought fairly to be excused. But this relief is **not** available in wrongful trading proceedings ([[Re Produce Marketing Consortium Ltd [1989] BCLC 513, ChD]]).

The risk of action for wrongful trading can be of concern to directors, particularly in a difficult economic climate. For this reason, the government suspended the wrongful trading provisions from 01/03/20-30/09/20 to allow company directors to attempt to keep their business going during COVID without risking personal liability. A further suspension was announced 26/11/20-30/04/21.
