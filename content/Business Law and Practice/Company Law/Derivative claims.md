# Derivative Claims

>A “derivative claim” is a claim brought by a member in respect of a cause of action vested in the company seeking relief on behalf of the company (s 260(1) CA 2006).

Claims brought by members to vindicate a wrong done **to the company**. These were originally dealt with by the courts according to the rule from [[Foss v Harbottle [1843] ]], but since CA 2006 there is a statutory procedure for a shareholder to bring a derivative claim on behalf of the company, which replaces the common law in so far as it applies.

Note that the statutory rules, laid out under [ss 260-263 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/260) only affect claims for wrongs done to the company, and even then, only claims for wrongs done by **directors** (s 260(3)).

This means there are still scenarios in which the old case law is relevant.

```ad-statute
title:s 260 CA 2006
(1) This Chapter applies to proceedings in England and Wales or Northern Ireland by a member of a company—
- (a) in respect of a cause of action vested in the company, and
- (b) seeking relief on behalf of the company.

This is referred to in this Chapter as a “derivative claim”.

(2) A derivative claim may only be brought—
- (a) under this Chapter, or
- (b) in pursuance of an order of the court in proceedings under section 994 (proceedings for protection of members against unfair prejudice).

(3) A derivative claim under this Chapter may be brought only in respect of a cause of action arising from an actual or proposed act or omission involving negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a director of the company. The cause of action may be against the director or another person (or both).

(4) It is immaterial whether the cause of action arose before or after the person seeking to bring or continue the derivative claim became a member of the company.

(5) For the purposes of this Chapter—
- (a) “director” includes a former director;
- (b) a shadow director is treated as a director; and
- (c) references to a member of a company include a person who is not a member but to whom shares in the company have been transferred or transmitted by operation of law.

## Foss V Harbottle

The rule from [[Foss v Harbottle [1843] ]] is summarised in [[Edwards v Halliwell [1950] 2 All ER 1064 CA]] as:

1. The proper claimant in an action in respect of a wrong done to a company is prima facie the company itself (**proper claimant principle**)
2. Where the alleged wrong is a transaction which might be made binding on the company and all its members by a simple majority of members, no individual member of the company is allowed to maintain an action in respect of that matter (*cadit quaestio* - majority rule). Known as the **internal management principle**
3. If the matter relates to an irregularity that the company is able to ratify or condone by its own internal procedure, then no individual member may bring an action (**irregularity principle**)

Exceptions to the rule:

- Where the act complained of is ultra vires or illegal
- Where the matter is one which could validly be done or sanctioned only by some special majority of members, or there has been non-compliance with a special procedure
- Where the personal and individual rights of the members have been infringed
- Where what has been done amounts to a 'fraud on the minority' and wrongdoers themselves are in control of the company

There is academic debate as to whether these are true exceptions, or separate rights of action. The generally accepted view is that only the fourth exception set out is a true excxeption to the rule in [[Foss v Harbottle [1843] ]], since other exceptions can be explained on the basis of the member being allowed to sue for the breach of their personal rights.

## Statutory Procedure

Derivative claims can be brought under CA 2006 Part 11.

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
| --------- | ------------ |
|Allow individual members to 'right a wrong' on behalf of the company in circumstances where the company itself does not bring a claim | Relief gained is only awarded to the company, not the individual member bringing proceedings.

- A claim may be brought by any member ([s 260(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/260))
- A claim may be brought against any director and/ or another person (acting in such a capacity), including former directors (s 260(3), s 260(5))
- Grounds for bringing a claim: any act or omission, actual or proposed, involving negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust by a director—s260(3).
- It is immaterial whether the cause of action arose before or after the claimant became a shareholder (s 260(4)).

```ad-important
There is no need to demonstrate any actual loss suffered by the company, or any benefit gained by the directors. 
```

A member bringing a derivative claim under s 260 must apply to court for permission to continue the claim (s 261-263). This involves two hearings:

1. The court first considers whether the applicant has a **prima facie case** for permission to continue the derivative claim.
2. The second stage is a full permission hearing ([s 263 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/263)). The court may order the company, as well as the applicant, to provide evidence.

Two stage process came from the case [[Iesini v Westrip Holdings Ltd [2009] EWHC 2526 (Ch)]].

### First Stage

The preliminary stage involves the applicant obtaining the permission of the court to bring a  
derivative claim (CA 2006, s 261(1)).

The purpose of this stage is to enable the court to quickly dismiss cases which stand little/ no chance of success.

#### Bypassing Stage

The parties may be able to bypass this where the defendant company concedes there is a prima facie case ([[Franbar Holdings Ltd v Patel [2008] EWHC 1534]]).

Alternatively, it may be bypassed where the court may be prepared to hear the first and second stages together ([[Stimpson v Southern Landlords Association [2009] EWHC 1556 (ChD)]]). But this has been criticised for not filtering out unmeritorious cases ([[Re Severn Holdings [2011] All ER (D) 78]]).

#### Full Permission Hearing

s 263 sets out absolute and discretionary bars to granting permission to a member to continue a derivative claim.

Absolute bars: permission must be refused if the court is satisfied (s 263(2)) -

>(a) that a person acting in accordance with section 172 (duty to promote the success of the company) would not seek to continue the claim, or  
>(b) where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that is yet to occur, that the act or omission has been authorised by the company, or  
>(c) where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has already occurred, that the act or omission -  
>(i) was authorised by the company before it occurred, or  
>(ii) has been ratified by the company since it occurred.

Discretionary bars: factors that a court must be take into consideration when exercising its discretion (s 263(3)):

>(a) whether the member is acting in good faith in seeking to continue the claim;  
>(b) the importance that a person acting in accordance with section 172 (duty to promote the success of the company) would attach to continuing it;  
>(c) where the cause of action results from an act or omission that is yet to occur, whether the act or omission could be, and in the circumstances would be likely to be—  
>(i) authorised by the company before it occurs, or  
>(ii) ratified by the company after it occurs;  
>(d) where the cause of action arises from an act or omission that has already occurred, whether the act or omission could be, and in the circumstances would be likely to be, ratified by the company;  
>(e) whether the company has decided not to pursue the claim;  
>(f) whether the act or omission in respect of which the claim is brought gives rise to a cause of action that the member could pursue in his own right rather than on behalf of the company.

[s 264 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/264): the court must have particular regard to any evidence before it as to the views of members of the company who have no personal interest, direct or indirect in the matter ([[Smith v Croft (No 2)]]).

Only if successful at the permission stage will the derivative claim proceed to a full trial of the issues raised.

## Approach of Courts

There was concern that the new statutory procedure would open flood-gates of litigation. But this has not been the case, successful claims remain rare. Disincentives include that the company recovers damages rather than the members, and the claims are costly.

Case | Description
---|---
[[Mission Capital v Sinclair [2008] EWHC 1339 (Ch)]] | Directors bringing a claim seeking reinstatement, not successful.
[[Franbar Holdings v Patel [2008] EWHC 1534]] | Derivative claim rejected because matters were covered under other rememdies
[[Iesini v Westrip Holdings Ltd [2009] EWHC 2526 (Ch)]] | Derivative claim rejected because directors had not breached duties. Procedure surrounding disclosure clarified.
[[Stainer v Lee [2010] EWHC 1539 (Ch)]] | Limited permission to continue proceedings where outcome unclear and more information needed.
[[Cullen Investments Ltd v Brown [2015] EWHC 473 (Ch)]] | Shareholder assumed all financial risk for the litigation so allowed to continue, given that it was held to be in the best interests of the company.
[[Bridge v Daley [2015] EWHC 2121 (Ch)]] | Claim rejected since most shareholders/ board members did not support it.

## Cost of Claims

Rule 19.9E of The Civil Procedure Rules allows the court to order the company to indemnify the claimant against any liability in respect of costs incurred in the claim or the permission application, or both.

An application for costs may be made at the same time as the permission application (a 'pre-emptive costs order'). These were first awarded in [[Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2) [1975] QB 373, CA]], so often referred to as “Wallersteiner orders”.

## Derivative Claims Vs S 994

- s 994 unfair prejudice claim easier to bring and proceed with (no permission requirement)
- Under s 994, the remedy obtained is for the member, not the company
- Derivative action may be preferable where the aim of the claimant is not to be bought out (the most common remedy in unfair prejudice claims) but for the company to benefit ([[Clark v Cutland [2004] 1 WLR 783]])
- Where a shareholder brings a claim for unfair prejudice under s 994, s 996(2)(c) gives the court the power to direct the claimant to bring a derivative claim (though rare).

Claims may often be brought on more than one ground (key case: [[Paramount Powders (Badyal v Badyal) [2019] EWCA Civ 1644]]).

The court will also be reluctant to grant permission for a derivative claim if a claim for unfair prejudice is also possible - [[Mission Capital v Sinclair [2008] EWHC 1339 (Ch)]], [[Franbar Holdings v Patel [2008] EWHC 1534]].

However, this is not an absolute bar and in appropriate circumstances the court may hear proceedings under s 260 & s 994 together–[[Phillips v Fryer [2012] ]]
