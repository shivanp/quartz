# Fraudulent trading

## Liability of Directors of Insolvent Company

The provisions on fraudulent and wrongful trading in IA 1986 were enacted to prevent the reckless and negligent conduct on the part of those running companies. They are examples of claims in which the corporate veil may be pierced and directors held liable for losses made by the company.

## Claim for Fraudulent Trading

A claim can be brought under s 213/ 246ZA IA 1986 against:

> Any person (s 213(2), s 246ZA) who is knowingly party to the carrying on of any business of the company, with intent to defraud creditors or for any fraudulent purpose (s 213(1), s 246ZA(1)).

[s 213 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/213) (in [[Liquidation]]) and [s 246ZA IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/246ZA) (in administration) impose a civil liability to contribute to the funds available to the general body of unsecured creditors suffering loss caused by carrying on of the company's business with intent to defraud.

There is a corresponding criminal claim for fraudulent trading under [s 993 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/993). The claim may be brought by a liquidator (s 213) or by an administrator (s 246ZA), though court approval is required.

## Dishonesty

Actual dishonesty must be proven for a claim for fraudulent trading to succeed. This is assessed on a subjective basis, i.e., what the particular person knew or believed.

Knowledge includes blind-eye knowledge, which requires a suspicion of the relevant facts together with a deliberate decision to avoid confirming that they did exist ([[Morris v State Bank of India [2005] 2 BCLC 328]])

Fraud is defined for the purposes of s 213 as requiring

> “Real dishonesty involving, according to current notions of fair trading among commercial men at the present day, real moral blame.” ([[Re Patrick and Lyon Ltd [1933] Ch 786]])

Not necessary to show that all the company's creditors have been defrauded ([[Re Gerald Cooper Chemicals Ltd [1978] Ch 262]]).

## Remedies

A person found to be liable under s 213 / 246ZA can be ordered to make a contribution to the company's assets as the court thinks proper. The court does not have the power to include a punitive element in the amount awarded; the contribution should only reflect and compensate for the loss caused to the creditors ([[Morphitis v Bernasconi [2003] 2 BCLC 53]]).

Any sums recovered are held on trust for the unsecured creditors generally, and not for the defrauded creditor ([[Re Esal (Commodities) Ltd [1997] 1 BCLC 705]]).

### Director Fraudulent Trading

Where the court makes an order against a person under s 213 / 246ZA, and that person is also a director, the court is likely also to make a disqualification order under [s 10 CDDA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/10).

### Criminal Sanctions

Criminal sanctions can be imposed by the court under [s 993 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/993), to punish a person knowingly party to fraudulent trading, whether or not the company is being wound up. The penalties are imprisonment (of up to 10 years on indictment) and/or fines.

### Fraudulent Vs Wrongful

A very high standard of proof is required in practice for a successful claim in fraudulent trading. So claims are rare, and claims for [[Wrongful trading]] under s 214 / 246ZB IA 1986 are more often brought against directors.
