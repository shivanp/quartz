# allotted

> Shares are said to be allotted when a person acquires the unconditional right to be included in the company's register of members in respect of those shares ([s 558 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/558)).

By contrast, there is no statutory definition of 'issue' of shares, but it has been held that shares are only issued, and only form part of a company's [[Issued share capital]], once the shareholder has actually been registered as such in the company's register of members, and his or her title has become complete.
