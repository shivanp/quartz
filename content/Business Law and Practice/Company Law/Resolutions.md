# Resolutions

Decisions of directors taken by passing board resolutions at board meetings (see below).

Decisions of shareholders taken by passing [[Shareholder resolutions]] at a General Meeting, or in writing. Shareholder resolutions are either [[Ordinary resolution]] or [[Special resolution]].

## Board Resolutions

Decisions of directors can be made by majority decision at a meeting of directors ([Art 7(1) MA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#collectively)). This is the usual procedure for directors' decision-making. Decisions at board meetings are taken by majority vote on a show of hands (>50% required for a resolution to pass).

If there is deadlock, the [[Chairman of the board]] (if appointed under Art 12 MA) has the casting vote ([Art 13 MA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#casting)).

### Quorum

[Art 11 MA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#quorum) confirms that no proposal may be voted on at a board meeting unless a quorum is participating in the meeting. Art 11(2) states the quorum may be fixed from time to time by a decision of the directors, but must never be less than two. Unless otherwise fixed, the quorum is two.

### Alternative Procedure

[Art 8 MA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#unanimous) makes provision for directors to instead make decisions by **unanimous agreement**, without having to hold a board meeting. Requires all directors to indicate they share a common view (this can be 'by any means' but a written record of decision must be kept ([Art 15 MA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#records))).

N.B. obviously, these rules don't apply to companies with just one director (Art 7(2))

## Shareholder Resolutions

### Features

More fundamental decisions often cannot be taken by directors until they receive authorisation from the shareholders:

- Changing company's constitution
- Approval of transactions between directors and company
- Declaration of dividends

Generally for decision-making, [[Ordinary resolution]] are sufficient unless the Articles explicitly require a higher majority ([s 281(3) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/281)).

### Voting

Voting either by show of hands or poll.

- When voting by show of hands, each shareholder present entitled to one vote, regardless of number of shares held (provided that the share has voting rights under the Articles).
- When voting by poll, every shareholder has one vote in respect to each share held by him ([s 284 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/284)).
- The votes are counted out of the shareholders who are present and voting at the meeting.

#### Right to Demand a Poll Vote

[s 321 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/321) sets out conditions which must be met in order for a shareholder to demand a poll vote. These conditions may be relaxed by a provision in the Articles, and are in fact relaxed by [Art 44 MA](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#pollvotes) (broadly, poll vote if 2 people demand it, or person/people representing $\geq 10\%$ of the total voting rights of all the shareholders having the right to vote on the resolution). Note that the Articles in this situation cannot include provisions more onerous than that in CA 2006.

#### Right to Appoint a Proxy

A member of a company is entitled to appoint another person to exercise all or any of his rights to speak and vote at any GM in his place ([s 324 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/324)).

Corporate shareholders must appoint a representative to attend General Meetings under [s 323 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/323).

#### Quorum for a General Meeting

[s 318(2) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/318) says the quorum for a GM is two qualifying persons (including proxies and representatives of corporate shareholders). [s 323 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/323) says that if a corporation is a member of a company, it may, by resolution of its directors, authorise a person or persons to act as its representative at any meeting of the company.

If a company only has one member, 1 person makes a quorum for a GM ([s 318(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/318)).

[MA 38](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares/model-articles-for-private-companies-limited-by-shares#pollvotes) confirms that no business other than the appointment of the chairman of the meeting is to be transacted at a General Meeting if the persons attending it do not constitute a quorum.

### Written Resolutions

By [s 281 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/281), [[Private companies]] may pass a shareholders' resolution without holding a General Meeting, by using the [[Company procedure#Written resolutions procedure]]. The relevant majority counted out of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution (as opposed to all those present and voting at an AGM). A written resolution has effect as if passed at a General Meeting ([s 288(4) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/288)).

A written resolution is a method of voting, not a type of vote.

#### Process

Written resolutions must be sent to all eligible members (those entitled to vote on it). There is a time limit of 28 days for these members to respond. After this, the resolution will be deemed not passed if a sufficient majority of shareholders (normal thresholds out of **all eligible members**) have not indicated they vote in favour of the resolution.

#### Limitations

Two resolutions that may not be passed as written resolutions ([s 288(2) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/288)):

1. Removal of a director, under [s 168 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/168)
2. Removal of an auditor, under [s 510 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/168)

For both of these resolutions, the person concerned has the right to address the shareholders at a general meeting.

### Duomatic Principle

[[Re Duomatic Ltd [1969] 2 Ch 365]] established the principle that informal resolutions agreed by all the shareholders outside a formal meeting will be valid and binding.

Must have unqualified agreement of **all** the shareholders, whether this is express or implied, verbal or by conduct ([[Schofield v Schofield [2011] EWCA Civ 103]]).

However, this does not allow shareholders to take decisions which would be unlawful under the CA 2006, and it may not be valid for certain resolutions, such as those required to reduce a company’s capital ([[Re Barry Artist [1985] 1 WLR 1305]]), or to dismiss a director or the company’s auditors.

### Shareholders May Vote in Their Own Interests

General principle: shareholders may vote in their own interests. Shareholders are under no fiduciary duty to help the company and can vote as they wish, regardless of whether the vote will be in the best interests of the company ([[Pender v Lushington (1877) 6 ChD 70]]).

Shareholders who are also directors can ignore [[Fiduciary duties]] when voting in their capacity as shareholders ([North-West Transportation Co Ltd v Beatty (1887) 12 App Cas 589]).

But shareholders must act in bona fides way ([[Clemens v Clemens Bros [1976] 2 All ER 268]]). The principle applies to shareholders who are also directors, when voting in their capacity as shareholders ([[Northern Counties Securities Ltd v Jackson & Steeple Ltd [1974] 1 WLR 1133]]).

Shareholders may vote as they wish to remove a director, provided due process has been followed ([[Citco Banking Corporation NV v Pusser's Ltd [2007] UKPC 13]]).

In exceptional circumstances, the courts have made orders to restrain a shareholder from exercising their vote in a way that was **irrational** ([[Standard Chartered Bank Ltd v Walker [1992] 1 WLR 561]]).

### Voting on a Decision to Amend the Articles

When shareholders are voting on a decision to amend the articles, the court will look at whether reasonable shareholders could have considered that the amendment was for the benefit of the company.

Shareholders must vote to amend the articles in good faith ([[Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa [1900] 1 Ch 656]]) and not undermine substantive rights of minority shareholders. If they do this, the court may hold the amendment invalid.

[[Sidebottom v Kershaw, Leese & Co Ltd [1920] 1 Ch 154 (Court of Appeal)]]: alteration held valid in the alteration of the company.

[[Citco Banking Corporation NV v Pusser's Ltd [2007] UKPC 13]]: creation of new class of shares held reasonable.
