# Memorandum

[s 17 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/17) says memorandum no longer forms part of the company's constitution â€“ only required as part of the procedure to register a company at Companies House. So now only amounts to a declaration on part of the company's subscribers that they wish to form a company and agree to become members of that company ([s 8 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/8).

Previously, memorandum was more complex. [[Companies]] were required to include *an objects clause* setting out the purpose of forming the company, and acting outside of this was described as acting *ultra vires* (outside the company's capacity).

[[Companies]] formed under CA 2006 have **unrestricted objects** ([s 31 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/31)) unless these are specifically restricted in Articles.[s 28 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/28): for older companies incorporated under CA 1985, any provisions mentioned in the memorandum must be treated as provisions in company's Articles.

So under CA 2006, objects clauses of older companies continue to be in force, unless Articles of that company are amended to remove this objects clause.
