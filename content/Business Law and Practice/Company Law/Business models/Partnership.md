- Governed by Partnership Act 1890

## Formation

[s1(1) PA 1890](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/section/1) defines partnership as

 > the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in the common with a view to profit

Section 2 PA 1890 gives rules for determining existence of partnership, such as whether profits and/or losses are shared, whether loan is made from one partner to another, whether property is held jointly…

- Agreement to share losses as well as profits makes partnership more likely ([[Northern Sales (1963) Ltd v Ministry of National Revenue (1973) 37 DLR (3d) 612]])
- If person not acknowledged as partner, makes them less likely to be considered a partner ([[Walker vs. Hirsch [1884] 27 CH.D 460]])

## Partnership Act 1890

Unless a partnership agreement is drawn up by a solicitor, it will be governed by the default provisions of [PA 1890](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/contents). These include:

- Partners equally share in the profits and losses of the business, even when they have contributed to the capital equally ([s 24(1) PA 1890](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/section/24))
- Partners not entitled to a salary ([s 24(6) PA 1890]((https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/section/24))
- Decisions arising during ordinary course of business decided by majority. Any changes to nature of partnership requires unanimity ([s 24(8) PA 1890](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/section/24))
- A partner cannot be expelled by majority vote unless all partners have previously agreed that a majority can do this ([s 25 PA 1890]((https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/section/25))).
- The effect of a partner leaving the partnership is dissolution of the partnership ([s 26 PA 1890](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/section/26))

Mutual rights and obligations of partners can be varied at any time by their unanimous consent ([s 19 PA 1890](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/53-54/39/section/19)). This means that partners can themselves draw up a partnership agreement setting out how they wish their partnership to run. In a modern partnership, it is important that this is done – the default provisions aren't very suitable for a modern business. Typically, the following will be addressed:

- Profit sharing ratio
- Salaries
- Decision-making
- What happens when a partner leaves the partnership?
- How many new partners may be appointed and how partners may be removed.
