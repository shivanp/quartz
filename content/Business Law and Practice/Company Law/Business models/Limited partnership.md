# Limited partnership

## Characteristics

Two types of partners:

1. Limited partners who have limited liability. They cannot be involved in the management of the business. If they do get involved in management, they lose their limited status and become general partners with unlimited personal liability.
2. General partners, who run the business and have unlimited liability (as in a traditional partnership).

Governed by the Limited Partnership Act 1907 (as amended). Must be registered at Companies House (but don't need to file accounts).

Often used for investment vehicles, where an investor puts money into a business run by the general partner. On 06/04/2017 a new sub-category of limited partnership called a Private Fund Limited Partnership was created â€“ now commonly used for investment vehicles.
