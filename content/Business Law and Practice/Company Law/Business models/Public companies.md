A public company's name ends with the words 'Public Limited Company' or 'Plc' ([s 58(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/58)).

- A public company must have a share capital with a nominal value of at least £50,000 (or the euro equivalent), at least a quarter of which must be paid at time of purchase ([s586 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/586) & [s763 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/763))
