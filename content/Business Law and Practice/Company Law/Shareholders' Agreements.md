# Shareholders' Agreements

## Definition

The company's constitution as set out in the articles may be supplemented by a shareholders' agreement. This is a contract entered into between the shareholders. It is usually entered into by all shareholders.

The company may also be a party, but **not** to any provisions in the agreement which would have the effect of fettering the statutory powers of the company.

## Pros and Cons

- Normal contractual rules apply. So unlike the articles, which can be altered by special resolution ([s 21 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/21)), a shareholders' agreement can only be altered if all shareholders agree.
- The provisions of a shareholders' agreement may also be enforceable by injunction.
- It is a private document (whereas articles are Public and registered at Companies House)
- Only binds shareholders who are party to it.

## Effect

A company may not bind itself not to exercise its statutory powers. But an agreement by the members in a shareholders' agreement not to support such a resolution is binding.

So they can be an effective way of shareholders limiting the possibility of major changes within the company, and protecting the interests of minority shareholders. See [[Russell v Northern Bank Development Corpn [1992] 1 WLR 588 (House of Lords)]].

## Typical Terms

The purpose is generally for the shareholders to agree on how to vote on particularly important decisions, in a way that the company cannot do in the articles due to CA 2006 restraints.

Typical provisions:

1. Each of the shareholders is entitled to appoint a director;
2. No shareholder will vote in support of an alteration in the company's articles unless all agree;
3. No shareholder will vote to remove a director unless all agree;
4. Except in specified circumstances, no shareholder will require the repayment of money they had lent to the company.

Note that the main disadvantage of a shareholders' agreement is that it is binding only on those shareholders who signed up to it. So not on anyone who takes a transfer of shares or joins the company as a new member on a new issue of shares at a later date.

This is often dealt with by requiring the new shareholders to join an existing shareholders' agreement by executing a “Deed of Adherence”.
