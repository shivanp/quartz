# Liability in tort and crime

## Liability in Tort and Crime

Company can be liable in tort in two ways:

1. Primary liability – company itself said to have committed the tort through acts of an individual attributed to the company.
2. [[Vicarious liability]] – an individual within the company is personally liable for the tort, but the company is additionally vicariously liable for a person's act or omission. So the company not itself at fault, but legally responsible for acts of another.

### Attribution Theory

Requires a particular individual within a corporate organisational structure to be identified as controlling/ guiding mind. Important cases:

- [[Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd [1915] AC 705]]
- [[Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153]]
- [[Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500]]: after this case the controllers of the company for the purposes of attribution are the ones relevant to liability.

Note that in certain circumstances, a company may be primarily liable, even if a mental element is required.

### Corporate Manslaughter

Criminal liability still difficult to establish after [[Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500]] since difficult to find one particular individual with necessary criminal intent, where fault due to several people. In [[R v P & O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd (1991) 93 Cr App R 72]] a precedent was set that a company may be properly charged with corporate manslaughter.

Corporate manslaughter is an indictable only offence (meaning a claim can only be dealt with by the [[High Court]], and not by the [[Magistrates' Court]]). In England and Wales, proceedings may not be instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecution.

### 2007 Corporate Homicide Act

Enacted to establish the offence of corporate manslaughter. Abolishes the offence of gross negligence manslaughter as far as it relates to companies and organisations.

> [!defn]
> Corporate manslaughter is committed by a company if the manner in which its activities are managed or organised by its senior management causes the death of a person and amounts to a gross breach of the relevant duty of care owed to the person (ss 1-3 Corporate Homicide Act).
>
