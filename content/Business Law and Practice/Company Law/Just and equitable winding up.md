# Just and equitable winding up

## Authority

Historically, this was the only remedy available to the aggrieved minority shareholder.

Set out in [s 122(1)(g) Insolvency Act 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/122):

>“A company may be wound up by the court if the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up.”

A minority shareholder may apply to the court for this remedy. It comes from the law of partnership, where the courts of equity had jurisdiction to dissolve a partnership where the relation between its members had broken down.

This is a Draconian remedy of last resort, ending the life of the company.

## Consequences

[s 127 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/127) provides that:

>“…any disposition of the company’s property, and any transfer of shares, or alteration in the status of the company’s members, made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless the court otherwise orders, void”.

Banks will freeze company assets upon receiving notice of such a petition. Any payments made out of the company's bank account after presentation of the petition can be set aside by the liquidator when the company has been wound up. So the company is effectively paralysed pending the outcome of the petition.

## Grounds for Petition

Key case: [[Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] AC 360 HL]].

Lord Wilberforce said that the remedy gave the court a wide discretionary jurisdiction. He considered it important not to create categories or particular grounds on which a claim for just and equitable winding up can be brought. Cases should be considered individually.

Successful petitions for just and equitable winding up usually result where the relationship between directors and/ or shareholders have broken down to the extent that it is not possible for the company to be run effectively.

### Substratum Has Failed

Where the petitioner establishes that the commercial object for which the company was formed has failed or been fulfilled, this will be a ground for just and equitable winding up ([[Re German Date Coffee Co [1882] 20 Ch D 169]]). Note that this ground is of much less importance now as s 31(1) CA 2006 provides that a company's objects will generally be unrestricted.

### Fraud

Where a company has been formed to perpetuate fraud and a winding up represents the best way for its shareholders to recover the money they invested, a court may grant a winding up order ([[Re Thomas Edward Brinsmead & Sons [1897] 1 Ch 406, CA]]).

### Deadlock

Rare for there to be total deadlock in company management, since the chairman generally has a casting vote. But when it does, the court may order the company to be wound up ([[Re Yenidje Tobacco Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 426, CA]]).

### Justifiable Loss in Confidence in the Company's Management

Where the company is a quasi-partnership, the court may order it to be wound up if there is a lack of confidence in the management ([[Loch v John Blackwood Ltd [1924] AC 783, PC]]).

There needs to be a lack of probity in the way the company is being run by the majority, effectively driving the minority out so that it is unjust and inequitable to require the minority to remain shareholders, therefore justifying the winding up.

### Exclusion From Participation in a Small Private Company, Where There Was a Relationship Based on Mutual Confidence

This happened in [[Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd [1973] AC 360 HL]]. Lord Wilberforce listed typical elements in petitions brought under this ground:

(i) the basis of the business association was a personal relationship and mutual confidence (often where a pre-existing partnership converts into a limited company);  
(ii) an understanding that all shareholders will participate in management;  
(iii) a restriction on the transfer of members' interests preventing the petitioner leaving.

He concluded that a just and equitable winding up would be appropriate where the petitioner:

>“can point to, and prove, some special underlying obligation of his fellow member(s) in good faith, or confidence, that so long as the business continues, he shall be entitled to management participation, an obligation so basic that, if broken, the conclusion must be that the association must be dissolved.”

## Bringing a Petition

[s 124(1) IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/124): an application to the court for a winding-up order may be made by a '**contributory**'. This means any person liable to contribute to the assets of a company in the event of it being wound up, which includes every past and present member.

For a fully paid up shareholder to bring a petition, they must show a 'tangible interest in the company'.

This has been held to mean that the shareholder must prove (balance of probabilities) that there will be a surplus among the shareholders after payment of the company's debts, liabilities and the expenses of the [[Liquidation]] ([[Re Rica Gold Washing Co (1879) 40 LT 531, CA]]). If the shareholder cannot prove surplus assets, they may alternatively establish tangible interest, by showing that they would achieve some advantage/ avoid or minimise some disadvantage if the company was wound up ([[Re Chesterfield Catering Co [1977] Ch 373]]).

Petitioner's own conduct is relevant, since the remedy is equitable.
