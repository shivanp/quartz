# Unfair Prejudice

## Minority Shareholders

The directors are responsible for the day-to-day running of the company and have the authority necessary to act on the company's behalf in this regard (MA 3).

Recall, certain key decisions require shareholder approval:

- Amending the company's articles ([s 21 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/21))
- Granting a director a long-term service contract ([s 188 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/188))
- Making a loan to a director ([s 197 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/197))
- Removing a director from office ([s 168 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/168))

Both directors and shareholders act by majority, and the principle of majority rule pervades company law. To balance this, there are some remedies available for minority shareholders where the majority abuse their position. Need to balance this carefully, of course (to stop obstruction of legitimate business goals by a litigious or vexatious shareholder).

The equitable remedies available to minority shareholders are however limited, so they are advised to instead enter into Shareholder Agreements, which are able to more robustly protect their interests under contract law.

## Development of Law Relating to Unfair Prejudice

Historically, minority shareholders had very little recourse. The only remedy was to petition the court for the company to be wound up on the grounds that it was just and equitable to do so. But generally this does not benefit minority shareholders anyway.

## Statutory Definition

s 459 CA 1985 (now [s 994 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/994)) introduced an action for unfair prejudice. Note that s 994 CA 2006 is substantially the same as s 459 CA 1985 (so old case law relevant).

```ad-defn
title: s 994(1)

A member of a company may apply to the court by petition for an order … on the ground:
(a) that the company’s affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of its members generally or of some part of its members (including at least himself), or
(b) that any actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.
```

### Conduct of Company's Affairs

The conduct complained of must be an act or acts done by the company (e.g., by the directors), not the conduct of an individual shareholder acting in their private capacity.

Case law:

- [[Re Legal Costs Negotiators Ltd [1999] 2 BCLC 171 CA]]: conduct must be specifically relating to the company's affairs
- [[Re Home & Office Fire Extinguishers Ltd [2012] All ER D 31]]: overlap between conduct relating to company's affairs and personal disputes where personal disputes relate to working together.
- [[Re City Branch Group Ltd, Gross v Rackind [2005] BCC 11]]: conduct of subsidiary could be regarded as falling within the affairs of a holding company.

### Interests of the Members

The petitioner must prove that their interests in their capacity as members have been unfairly prejudiced as a result of conduct on the part of the company.

The requirement is construed widely. Members have an interest in the value of their shares, so will be able to claim if they can show that “the value of their shareholding has been seriously jeopardised by reason of a course of conduct on the part of those persons who have had de facto control of the company, which has been unfair to the member concerned” ([[Re Bovey Hotel Ventures Ltd (1981)]]).

In [[Gamlestaden Fastigheter AB v Baltic Partner Ltd [2007] UKPC 26]] it was held that the interests of members extended to the interests of creditors in cases where the interests of members become artificial/ immaterial in a winding up.

### Unfair Prejudice

Leading authority is [[O'Neill v Phillips [1999] 1 WLR 1092 HL]]. This held that

1. Fairness in s 994 must be viewed in the context of a commercial relationship
2. The relationship between shareholders and the company is set out in the articles, which must be the starting point when determining whether conduct was unfair.

O'Neill: Must have breached a **contract** (articles/ shareholders' agreement) or some other **fundamental understanding**.

In [[Re Tobian Properties Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 998]], Arden LJ stated:

>“The key phrase in section 994(1), ‘unfairly prejudicial’, comprises two elements, unfairness and prejudice but both of these must be understood in the context of company law. The concept of fairness inherent in this phrase is flexible and open-textured, but it is not unbounded. The courts must act on a principled basis even though the concept is to be approached flexibly. They cannot decide whether to grant or refuse relief from unfair prejudice on the basis of palm-tree justice.”

```ad-tip
title: Unfair Prejudice Test


The [[O'Neill v Phillips [1999] 1 WLR 1092 HL]] test for unfair justice is that a petitioner must prove
- Breach of contract (the articles or a shareholders' agreement), or
- Breach of some fundamental understanding
```

The court will consider:

- Whether the conduct complained about is in accordance with the articles
- The scope of any fundamental understandings between the parties
- Unfairness is tested by looking at whether the majority had acted or was proposing to act in a manner which equity would regard as contrary to good faith
- Unlawful conduct will not necessarily be unfairly prejudicial, and trivial or technical infringements of the articles may not give grounds for an s 994 petition.

## Unfairly Prejudicial Conduct Examples

### Exclusion From Management

**Most common ground** for unfair prejudice petitions. In a small quasi-partnership private company, a member may expect to continue to participate in the management of the company on the basis of a fundamental understanding between the parties, despite the fact that any director may be validly removed from office by an ordinary resolution of the members under s 168 CA 2006.

But not the case that in every small quasi-partnership company, the removal from office of a director will automatically give rise to an unfair prejudice claim.

[[Re Tottenham Hotspur plc [1994] 1 BCLC 655]]

### Mismanagement

Poor management of a company will **not** generally give rise to a claim for unfair prejudice. Held that the risk of poor management is inherent in share ownership, and the courts will not interfere with a bona fide business decision made by the company's board or its majority shareholders, except where there are clear conflicts of interest ([[Re Elgindata Ltd [1991] BCLC 959]]).

In [[Re Macro (Ipswich) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 354]] gross mismanagement over a long period of time counted as unfairly prejudicial conduct.

### Breach of Directors' Fiduciary Duties

A number of successful petitions have been brought on the grounds of breach of directors' fiduciary duties.

In [[Re London School of Electronics [1986] Ch 211]] the petition for unfair prejudice succeeded where those in control of the company had misappropriated its assets (students) by diverting them to another business they owned.

[[Re Little Olympian Each-Ways Ltd (No 3) [1995] 2 BCLC 420, ChD]] was unfairly prejudicial conduct, where the directors sold the company's business at a substantial undervalue to another company as part of a wider transaction in which the directors received significant personal benefit.

In [[Re A Company (No 005287 of 1985) [1986] BCLC 68]] the petition for unfair prejudice succeeded on the grounds that the directors had made secret profits.

### Excessive Remuneration and Refusal to Pay Dividends

Generally, companies' articles of association provide that directors' remuneration should be determined by the general meeting. But in practice the power to determine directors' remuneration is delegated to the board, and the court will tend not to interfere with the business judgement of the board provided it has honestly determined the level of remuneration.

But ample scope for abuse of power here, so the court will be prepared to hold that failure to pay dividends and/ or directors awarding themselves excessive remuneration will be unfairly prejudicial conduct.

In [[Re a Company (No. 004415 of 1996) [1997] 1 BCLC 479]] the court held that if remuneration and dividend levels cannot be justified by “objective commercial criteria” then it would follow that the affairs of the company have been managed in a way which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of shareholders who are not directors.

## Bringing a Claim

Under s 994(1) the petition for unfair prejudice may be brought by a “member” of the company.

Section 112 defines a “member” as a subscriber to the company's memorandum and “every other person who agrees to become a member of the company and whose name is entered into the register of members”. Case law interprets this broadly:

- In [[Harris v Jones [2011] EWHC 1518]] the court held that a person to whom shares had been transferred but had not been registered as a member had the right to bring an s 994 petition
- In [[Blunt v Jackson [2013] EWHC 2090]] the judge noted that the court had the power to retrospectively amend the register of members. So the court allowed a person who had agreed to become a 50% shareholder and had worked for low wages in the belief he was a shareholder, but not registered as such, to succeed in a petition for unfair prejudice based on his exclusion from management.

## Remedies

The court has wide discretion in deciding appropriate remedies. Section 996(1): the court may

>“make such order as it thinks fit for giving relief in respect of the matters complained of”.

Then s 996(2) lists possible orders the court may make (though this is not determinative). The court may:

>(a) regulate the conduct of the company's affairs in the future;  
>(b) require the company (i) to refrain from doing or continuing an act complained of, or (ii) to do an act which the petitioner has complained it has omitted to do;  
>(c) authorise civil proceedings to be brought in the name and on behalf of the company by such person or persons and on such terms as the court may direct;  
>(d) require the company not to make any, or specified, alterations in its articles without the leave of the court;  
>(e) provide for the purchase of the shares by any members of the company by other members of the company or by the company itself…

### Share Purchase Order

There is a presumption that the court will grant an order for the purchase of the petitioner's shares by the company or another shareholder under s 996(2)(e) ([[Grace v Bigioli [2005] EWCA Civ 1222]]).

This is the most common remedy, usually sought by shareholders in small private companies who have limited options to sell their shares.

The court must then decide the valuation of the petitioner's shares. In [[Re Bird Precision Bellows Ltd (1984) [1986] Ch 658, CA]]held that for quasi-partnership companies, it would normally be unfair to impose a discount on the shares to represent the limited voting power and control of a minority shareholder, since for these companies generally the minority shareholder is being forced to sell their shares as a result of the unfairly prejudicial conduct.

### Valuation of Shares

The value of the shares may have changed considerably between the date on which the petition to court was made, and the date of judgement. So case law:

- [[Abbington Hotel Ltd [2011] EWHC 635]]: the starting point for the date of valuation of shares for a buy-out order under s 996 is the **date of judgement**. But the court is free to choose a date that is most appropriate in the circumstances of the case, which best remedies the unfair prejudice.
- [[O'Neill v Phillips [1999] 1 WLR 1092 HL]]: held that if the respondent has made a reasonable offer to buy out the petitioner, based on an expert valuation, then the respondent may be entitled to have the petition for unfair prejudice struck out.
- [[McCallum-Toppin [2019] EWHC 46 (Ch)]]: affairs carried out in an unfairly prejudicial manner, since the minority was deprived of dividends by the majority paying excessive salaries, and the majority was using the company as a personal piggy bank.
- [[Re Sprintroom [2019] EWCA Civ 932]]: a breach of duty by a director did not preclude his entitlement to a remedy as a shareholder.

## Structure for S 994 Questions

3 core elements:

- Conduct of the company's affairs – the conduct complained of must be acts done by the directors
- Interests of members – petitioner must show that the value of their shareholding has been jeopardised because of the conduct complained about
- Unfair prejudice – 2 principles in O'Neill v Phillips
	- (a) breach of articles/shareholders' agreement or
	- (b) breach of some fundamental understanding

Examples of unfair prejudice:

- Exclusion from management
- Mismanagement
- Breach of duties
- Excessive remuneration/failure to pay dividends

Likely remedy? Share purchase order but other possible orders under s996
