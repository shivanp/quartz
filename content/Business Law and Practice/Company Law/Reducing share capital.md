# Reducing share capital

## Rationale

It is normal practice for a company to review its capital requirements and reduce its share capital.

- The share capital is greater than the actual net assets, the company may wish to reduce its share capital to correspond to the actual net assets, with the hope it will be able to resume dividend payments
	- See [Reduction of Capital and How to Improve Your Balance Sheet](https://www.dcslegal.com/news-and-insights/reduction-capital-and-how-improve-your-balance-sheet)
- Where the company has surplus cash it may wish to return to shareholders, but reduce share capital at the same time.

## Court Procedure

Under [s 645 - 651 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/645), both public and private companies may reduce their capital using court procedure. This requires:

- A special resolution of shareholders
- An order of the court.

Creditors have a right to object before the court makes the order. The court can make an order confirming the reduction of capital on terms and conditions which it sees fit. Before such an order is made, the court must be satisfied that every creditor entitled to object has

1. consented to the reduction, or
2. had their debt repaid/ secured (s 648(2)).

Reduction of capital takes place on registration of the court order confirming the reduction and statement of capital at Companies House (s 649(5)).

## Simplified Procedure for Private Companies

Private companies can use the court procedure for reducing share capital, but can also use a simplified procedure under s 642-644. This involves producing

1. A solvency statement of the directors, and
2. A special resolution of shareholders.

It is an offence for the directors to make a solvency statement without having reasonable grounds for the opinions expressed in it.

### Solvency Statement

The solvency statement:

- Must be made not more than 15 days before the date on which the special resolution is passed (s 642(1));
- Must be signed by all directors;
- Must confirm:
	- There is no ground on which the company could be found to be unable to pay its debts (s 643(1)(a)), and
	- The company will be able to pay its debts for 12 months from the date of the solvency statement (s 643(1)(b)(ii)).

## Redemption and Purchase of Shares

CA 2006 sets out exceptions to the doctrine of capital maintenance, under which companies are able to:

- Issue shares that are **redeemable** at the option of either the company or the shareholder (s 684(1)).
	- A public company must have express authorisation in its articles to issue redeemable shares
	- Private companies have statutory authorisation to issue redeemable shares, subject to any specific restriction in their articles.
- Purchase their own shares (subject to any restriction or prohibition in the articles) (s 690(1)).

Term | Explanation
---|---
Redemption of shares | Shares to be redeemed were issued as redeemable shares. They were always temporary, and the terms of redemption were determined at the time of issue.
Purchase of shares | Parties will need to agree the terms of purchase at the time the company seeks to make the purchase.

### Redemption

Because redeemable shares are issued as such, there is no need for a contract to be prepared.

- To issue redeemable shares, there must be at least one other class of share ([s 684(4) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/684)).
- Shares may not be redeemable unless they are fully paid.
- Redemption will usually be out of **distributable profits**
	- Private limited companies can redeem **out of capital** provided that they comply with the detailed procedural requirements in CA 2006 for redemption out of capital ([s 687(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/687), [s 713 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/713)):
		- Accounts must be no more than three months old
		- Directors' statement and auditors' report ([s 714 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/714))
		- **Special resolution** of the shareholders are also required ([s 716 CA 2006])
	- Creditors must be notified and have a period in which to object.

### Purchase of Shares (buyback)

Purchase of own shares applies to non-redeemable shares. Any company may purchase its own shares (subject to articles).

The company must draw up a contract with the shareholder(s) selling shares for the purchase, which needs to be approved by an ordinary resolution of shareholders.

May be funded by:

- Distributable profits (all companies)
- Capital (private companies only)

Purchasing own shares using capital triggers further requirements, similar to those required for redemption of shares out of capital ([s 692(1)(a) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/692)).
