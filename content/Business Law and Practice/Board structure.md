# Board structure

## Directors Vs Shareholders

Since company inanimate, directors responsible for managing company on a day-to-day basis.

MA 3:

> Subject to the articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the company's business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the company.

Accountable to company, rather than shareholders (comes from case law).

Shareholders own the company but only input into key decisions (through shareholders resolutions). These include changing articles (requires special resolution – [s 21 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/21)), changing name of company (special resolution) and varying class rights. Shareholders can remove a director by ordinary resolution ([s 168 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/168))

Shareholders protected from the acts of a rogue director by MA 4:

> The shareholders may, by special resolutions, direct the directors to take, or refrain from taking, specified action.

## Directors

Directors able to take decisions against the wishes of a majority of shareholders ([[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821]]).

Term director not defined in CA 2006: just [s 250 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/250) stating 'director' includes any person occupying the position of director, by whatever name called.

### Classification at Law

- *De jure* directors
	- A director who has been validly appointed by law.
	- See [[directors]]
- *De facto* directors
	- Someone who assumes to act as a director but has in fact not been validly appointed.
	- No definitive test
	- [[Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 180]]: must be established whether someone is part of the corporate governance of the company and undertook decisions which would normally be taken by a director rather than tasks which could have been performed by a manager/ someone else below board level
	- In [[Smithton Ltd (formerly Hobart Capital Markets Ltd) v Naggar [2014] EWCA Civ 939]] held that it is necessary to consider:
		- The acts performed by the person and whether those acts were directorial in nature, both considering context and the effects of what individual has done
		- Whether company considered the person to be a director and held them out as such, and whether any third party considered them as such
	- The importance of recognising where a person is a *de facto* director is that the same fiduciary duties and liabilities in **insolvency** apply to all directors, including *de facto* directors.
- Shadow directors
	- A person (usually shareholder) may try to exert influence over board without being appointed as a director, to avoid duties imposed on directors
	- [s 251(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/251) defines shadow director as
	> A person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act.
	- s 251(2) says professional advisors are not to be regarded as shadow directors, though if the conduct of an advisor goes beyond the normal scope of professional capacity and is effectively controlling the company's affairs, the person will be held to be a shadow director ([[Re Tasbian Ltd (No 3) [1992] BCC 358]]).
	- So most of the provisions in CA 2006 & Insolvency Act 1986 imposing duties, obligations and restrictions on directors apply equally to shadow directors.
	- NOT LEGAL. Usually people breaking orders restraining them from being directors etc.

### Case Law: De Facto and Shadow Directors

1. [[The Commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs v Holland (2010)]]: director held not to be de facto director of a company B, given he directed company A and company A was a director for company B (directorship is not transitive, kinda).
2. [[Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 180]]: if directors of a parent company could be deemed shadow directors of the subsidiary (held: not necessarily).
3. [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Deverell [2000] 2 WLR 907]]: Morritt LJ said:
	> ‘It will, no doubt, be sufficient to show that in the face of ‘directions or instructions’ from the alleged shadow director the properly appointed directors or some of them cast themselves in a subservient role or surrendered their respective discretions. In this case the persons in question were consultants and the company’s board were accustomed to act in accordance with their directions and suggestions, therefore the court found that they were shadow directors.

4. [[Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Fielding [2005] EWHC 1638]]: position of influence, even where very strong, does not necessarily mean there is a shadow director. Must show that the governing majority of the board are accustomed to acting in accordance with directions of the alleged shadow director.
5. [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Deverell [2000] 2 WLR 907]], Morritt LJ said:
	> ‘It will, no doubt, be sufficient to show that in the face of ‘directions or instructions’ from the alleged shadow director the properly appointed directors or some of them cast themselves in a subservient role or surrendered their respective discretions. In this case the persons in question were consultants and the company’s board were accustomed to acting in accordance with their directions and suggestions, therefore the court found that they were shadow directors.

### De Facto Vs Shadow

Millett J in [[Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd [1994] 2 BCLC 180]]:

> “A de facto director is a person who assumes to act as a director. He is held out as a director by the company, and claims and purports to be a director, although never actually or validly appointed as such. To establish that a person was a de facto director of a company, it is necessary to plead and prove that he undertook functions in relation to the company which could properly be discharged only by a director… A shadow director, by contrast, does not claim or purport to act as a director. On the contrary, he claims not to be a director. He lurks in the shadows, sheltering behind others who, he claims, are the only directors of the company to the exclusion of himself. He is not held out as director by the company.”

### Classification in Practice

- Executive directors
	- A director who has been appointed to an executive office
	- MA 5: directors can delegate specific powers to an individual director
- Non-executive directors
	- An officer of the company, but not an employee of the company
	- Do not take part in day-to-day running; role is providing independent guidance.
- Alternate directors (sometimes)
	- Office of director is a personal responsibility, but some companies articles provide for alternate directors to take place of director where one or more director is absent
	- Usually a fellow director or someone approved by directors' resolution. Alternate director takes on voting power of absent director.
	- Becoming rare with video conferencing and stuff.
	- Thought that duties of directors will apply equally to alternate directors
- Nominee directors
	- Directors meant to vote in accordance with some sort of previous agreement (like in [[Freeman and Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480]] Kapoor and Hoon both appointed nominee directors).
