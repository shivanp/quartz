# Business Types

## Basics

 - Businesses can be incorporated or unincorporated
- Unincorporated
	- Sole trader
	- Partnership
- Incorporated
	- Private limited company
	- Public limited company
	- Limited liability partnership

### Sole Trader

- No formal steps needed to set up
- But must register with HMRC for tax purposes
- A professional running their own business is usually called a 'sole practitioner'.
- Sole proprietor also used
- Note a sole trader can have employees, so long as they own the entire business.
- Pay income tax as a self-employed person.
- Personally liable for all debts of the business: the business has no separate legal personality.

### Partnership

- Two or more people running and owning a business together.
- Governed by Partnership Act 1890
	- s 1: A partnership is legally formed when two or more persons carry on a business with a view to making a profit.
- Partnership run on the basis of a contract – can be oral or written
- No formalities to be satisfied.
- Each partner must register with HMRC for tax purposes.
	- In a partnership of individuals, partners taxed separately as self-employed individuals, paying income tax on their share of the profits of the partnership.
- Partnership has no separate legal status
	- Partners have unlimited liability for debts
	- Joint and several liability.

> [!summary]  
> Partners share:
> 1. Right to make decisions
> 2. Ownership of assets of the business (unless otherwise stated)
> 3. Profits of business
> 4. Unlimited liability for business debts

### Limited Partnership

- Form of unincorporated business
- Established under Limited Partnerships Act 1907 (LPA 1907)
- Structure:
	- Must be at least one general partner who has unlimited lability for all the debts of the partnership
	- Can also have limited partner(s) whose liability is limited to the amount they initially invested in the business, so long as the limited partner is:
		1. Not controlling or managing the LP
		2. Not having the power to take binding decisions on behalf of the LP
		3. Not removing their contribution to the LP for as long as it is in business.
	- If breached, partner becomes a general partner with unlimited liability.
- Not very popular as a business structure until recently, where they have made a comeback.
- Now used for some investment funds and VC funds because very lightly regulated and may be no need to make financial information available to the public.
- Registration:
	- LPs must be registered with the Registrar of Companies in accordance with s 8 LPA 1907 before they can start to trade
	- Application form containing details set out in s 8A LPA 1907 (names of partners, nature of business) must be completed and signed by all partners.
- “LP” at the end of the company name
- Since Apr 2017, can also set up a Private Fund LP (PFLP).
	- Only available to private investment funds which do not deal with members of the public.
	- Financial and administrative benefits
	- Created to win business from Luxembourg
- Rules governing LPs set to be tightened in [Economic Crimes Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/10/contents) to combat abuse of LP for money laundering.
	- LP used in EUR 200bn Danske Bank scandal.
	- Ukraine Russian laundromat etc. gives political agenda.

### Contractual Cooperation

- Possible for two or more parties to run a business on the basis of a cooperation agreement between them
- Less formal than a partnership
- Used for e.g., contracting to jointly explore and develop oil and gas fields.
- Often called joint ventures
- Terms of agreement can be kept confidential
- But lack of identity, lack of organisational structure and dangers of becoming a partnership by fulfilling s 1 PA 1890.

To avoid carrying on business ‘in common’ the participants must not merge their separate businesses, or more to the point, create a single business out of the venture. They may avoid the implication of carrying on a business in common if each participant retains legal and beneficial ownership of and operational control over their respective assets whilst pursuing the venture.

If they do retain ownership and control of their own assets the participants may decide, rather than share profits, to share gross returns, which is the turnover they generate through the joint venture. Sharing gross returns does not by itself infer a partnership.

In summary, the lesson of accidental partnerships is to regulate a venture with a formal agreement and in the process create or avoid a partnership as required having regard to the essential elements of the definition in section 1 of the Act.

### Company

- CA 2006 hunny
- Solicitors could not previously operate as a company, but this changed under the [Legal Services Act 2007](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/29/contents) (the “Tesco law”).
- Company has a **separate legal personality**
	- Recognised in law as a legal person
	- Directors run the company on a daily basis
- Register company
	- File documentation with the Registrar of Companies at Companies House
	- Fee is as low as £10
	- Once the company is successfully registered, the Registrar will issue a certificate of incorporation: company is then legally in existence
- Subject to corporation tax
- Must register with HMRC for corporation tax purposes, and usually as an employer for PAYE and National Insurance purposes.

### Unlimited Company

```ad-defn
title: Unlimited company
A company which does not limit the liability of its members (s 3(4) CA 2006)
```

Very rare; one example is Land Rover pre-2013.

A key advantage is that company finances do not need to be made public.

### Limited Company

```ad-defn
A company in which the liability of its members is limited by its constitution (CA 2006 s 3(1)). 
```

#### Limiting Liability

Limited company may limit liability:

1. By shares, or
2. By guarantee.

Limiting by guarantee is rare and usually applies to non-profits like charities, professional societies and property management companies (e.g., Bupa, Network Rail, Oxfam).

So the members guarantee that if the company is liquidated they will pay a specified sum to creditors under s 3(3) CA 2006. The owners' liability is usually limited to £1.

Can be easier to make changes to ownership than in a company limited by shares.

#### Private Limited Companies

Almost all companies are private limited companies. One of the biggest is Iceland.

```ad-defn
title: Private limited company
Any company that is not a public company (s 4(1))
```

An Ltd cannot raise money from members of the public at large by issuing securities such as shares (s 755 CA 2006).

#### Public Limited Company

Defined by s 4(2) CA 2006. Must be:

- A company limited by shares or guarantee
- Have a share capital complying with the requirements of CA 2006 to enable it to be registered as such.

Also require:

- Constitution to state it is a public company
- 'plc' on the end of the company name
- Owners of the company must invest a specified minimum in the company

#### Publicly Traded Company

A public company may apply to join a UK stock market. Note that not all do. Two main markets are:

- London Stock Exchange's Main Market
- Alternative Investment Market

```ad-warning
There is no obligation on a public company to join a stock market. Those which choose not to are called unlisted (e.g., John Lewis)
```

#### Main Market

- Principal stock market.
- Must complete an IPO
	- Lots of conditions and need to publicly disclose lots of information.
	- One condition is being admitted to the FCA's Official List
	- Such companies are often known as 'listed companies'
- Followed by onerous ongoing requirements.
	- Mainly apply to FCA's handbook
	- Do not apply to public companies which haven't joined the Main Market

#### AIM

- LSO's alternative investment market
- Separate from Main Market
- Now there is increasing competition between the two markets
- e.g., ASOS is on AIM
- Subject to AIM rules

#### Public Vs Private Companies

Legal differences:

- s 755 CA 2006: only a public company can offer its shares to the public at large
- s 154 CA 2006: a public company must have at least two directors
- CA 2006 also has provisions which only apply to publicly-traded companies rather than unlisted, and provisions which only apply to Main Market companies rather than AIM ones.

Practical differences:

- Possible for a private company to be owned by a single shareholder and managed by a single director (who might be the same person).

## Other Types of Company

There are a number of other, less common forms of company.

### Community Interest Company

CIC is a form of limited liability company, intended for businesses that wish to use their profits and assets for the public good. CIC has altruistic, charitable aims and uses a business to improve communities rather than make money. Such companies are governed by the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004, and set up under the formalities of the CA 2006.

### Charitable Incorporated Organisation

The Charities Act 2006 introduced the broad legal framework for a new legal form of corporate structure which is designed specifically for charities, the charitable incorporated organisation (CIO). The Charitable Incorporated Organisations (General) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/3012) set out the detail on how they will be established and operated.

The CIO is intended to provide the advantages of a corporate structure, such as reduced risk of personal liability, without this burden of dual regulation. It is not subject to company law and is regulated only by the Charities Commission. The first new CIOs were registered on 3 January 2013, and rules allow existing charities to convert to CIOs. There are now approximately 25,000 CIOs in existence at the time of writing.

### UK Societas

The UK Societas is a product of Brexit. Whilst the UK was a member of the EU, it was possible for a UK registered company to form a European public company in accordance with EU Regulation 2157/2001 on the Statute for a European Company. These companies are known as Societas Europaea (SE). They are a single company, or a group of companies, operating in different EU Member States which can operate as a single corporate entity subject to one set of rules valid in all Member States.

The European Public Limited-Liability Company (Amendment etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 amended the Regulation and the European Public Limited Liability Company Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/2326) which supplemented it in the UK. As a result, the UK registered SEs (of which there were only about 25 in existence) were converted into a new corporate form, the UK Societas. The UK Societas is only intended to be a temporary corporate form whilst it decides on which other UK corporate structure to adopt. There is, however, no deadline for this transformation to take place. It is not possible to set up a UK Societas from scratch.

### UK Establishment by Overseas Companies

Applies to a pre-existing foreign company that wishes to operate in the UK and set up a regular physical presence. Law set out in the Overseas Companies Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/1801).

All overseas companies that set up a branch (as defined in the 11th EU Company Law Directive 89/666/EEC) or any other place of business in the UK must register selected details of the establishment within one month of its opening.

Registration is not required if the overseas company does not have a physical presence in the UK. There are currently approximately 13,000 overseas companies with a UK establishment. In order to register, the overseas company must submit a registration application form, OS IN01.

### Company Formed by Special Act of Parliament

Historically, trading companies were sometimes established by a special Act of Parliament.

### Company Formed by Royal Charter

Company formed under the prerogative powers of the monarch by letters patent without using the powers of Parliament. The right to form a company this way does remain (s 1040 CA 2006).

## Limited Liability Partnership

A limited liability partnership (LLP) is formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000. However, the LLP is run with the informality and flexibility afforded by a partnership, and the partners are taxed as if the business were a partnership rather than a company.

Limited liability partnerships can be formed only by two or more members carrying on a lawful business with a view of profit.

### UKEIG

Whilst the UK was a member of the EU, it was possible for UK-based businesses to form a European economic interest grouping (EEIG). These are designed to enable businesses (or other entities such as universities) to form and maintain links with businesses from other EU Member States. In effect they are alliances between businesses in different Member States that wish to operate together across national borders.

Pursuant to the European Economic Interest Grouping (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018, these were converted into a new corporate form, the UKEIG. These are only intended to be a temporary corporate form whilst  
the UKEIG decides on which other structure to adopt. There is, however, no deadline for this transformation to take place. It is not possible to set up a UKEIG from scratch.

## Choosing Type

Ask:

- Can the entrepreneur set up this type of business?
	- Partnership and LLP require $\geq 2$ owners to exist
	- Public company requires $\geq 2$ directors
	- s 157 CA 2006: a person under 16 cannot be the director of a company.
	- Undischarged bankrupt person/ disqualified director under CDDA 1986 cannot be directors
- How much tax will the entrepreneur pay?
- What is the entrepreneur's attitude to risk?
	- LLP and Ltd have separate legal personalities
	- But remember that in practice people dealing with these forms of businesses will usually seek personal guarantees from owners anyway.
	- Risks in running a company due to the high level of regulation imposed by CA 2006 and other legislation.
	- Breach of directors' duties etc.
- What formalities are required?
	- Time and cost to incorporate (though admittedly minimal)
	- Partnership will require partnership agreement, and therefore legal fees.
	- A bigger issue is compliance with formalities after the business has been set up. Generally less for an LLP than a company.
	- LLPs have more flexibility in decision-making.
- Does the entrepreneur want to reveal information publicly?
	- Companies and LLPs must by law reveal a certain amount of information.
- How much will it cost to set up and run the business?
	- Sole trader or partnership may be set up without any costs.
	- Complying with CA regulations costs money
- Does status matter?
	- Company and LLP can offer a floating charge as a form of security for loans.
	- Companies have a wider pool of potential investors.

# Converting Business Types

## Sole Trader to Partnership

- No formalities: so long as statutory definition of a partnership in s 1 PA 1890 is complied with.
- Include a clause dealing with which assets are owned individually and which jointly as partnership assets.
- Have a formal partnership agreement
- If business name $\neq$ partnership name, set out the names and addresses for service of partners on all business stationery and the business premises.
- [[Capital Gains Tax]]
	- Where the sole trader agrees to share ownership, they will be disposing of a share in the assets.
	- If the assets are chargeable assets, possible CGT charge
	- Possible reliefs:
		- Hold-over relief if the disposal is a gift to the incoming partner
		- Business asset disposal relief
		- Annual exemption.
	- SDLT possibly - Finance Act 2004

## Unincorporated to Ltd

### Formalities

- Form or purchase a company and sell the existing business to it in exchange for shares in the company + possibly debentures (loan to company) or cash.
- Sale of business effected through a contract for sale, which will
	- Describe the asset being sold
	- Describe the price and the way in which it will be paid
	- Apportion the price to show the value attributed to various assets
	- Covenants designed to indemnify the sellers in respect of liability for existing debts, liabilities etc.
	- Contain the company's acceptance of the seller's title to the premises and of the equipment and stock in its current condition.

Title to assets may be passed:

1. Under the sale agreement
2. By physical delivery
3. Under a separate document.

If the company takes over the previous name of the business $\neq$ company name, company stationery and notice at company's business must state the company's name and address (CA 2006 ss 1202-1204).

### Income Tax

The individual partners will be assets for income tax under the rules for the **closing tax year** of a business up to the date of transfer of the business. Then the company pays corporation tax.

#### Capital Allowances

Where the partnership sells the company assets on which capital allowances have been claimed, there may be a **balancing charge to income tax** on any profit identified by comparing sale proceeds with write-down value. The profit/ loss would be taxed as part of the trading income in the closing tax year.

If the company is controlled by the sellers of the business, the company and the sellers can elect within **two years** that the **company shall take over the position of the sellers** so that no balancing charge occurs (CAA 2001, ss 266 and 267).

#### Trading Losses

If the unincorporated business makes trading losses not relieved when the business is transferred to the company, the losses can be carried forward and deducted from income received by the former partners from the company (e.g., dividends, salaries). Only available if business is transferred to the company **wholly or mainly in return for the issue of shares in the company**.

### Capital Gains

Business transferred to company: disposal to the company by individual partners of assets. Insofar as these are chargeable assets for CGT purposes, may be CGT charge. Consider reliefs.

#### Roll Over Relief on Incorporation of Business (s 162 TCGA 1992)

To apply, the business must be sold to the company as a going concern with all of its assets (excluding cash). But transferring all the assets can be problematic:

- Possible SDLT on land transfer
- Other expenses (legal costs)
- Possible double charge to taxation in relation to the future gain of assets transferred
- Availability of assets transferred for payment of the company's creditors.

Taxpayer may choose not to roll over their gain, to claim:

- EIS deferral relief
- Business asset disposal relief
- Annual exemption.

### Other Considerations

- SDLT
	- Chargeable on land transactions (FA 2003)
- VAT implications
	- Sellers must charge VAT on the transaction if the company is not registered for VAT purposes before the sale takes place.
	- So make sure the company is registered.
- Employees
	- The rights of employees are automatically transferred under Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006.

## Private to Public Company

- No tax or employee implications
- Possibility of public financing
- May affect the capital reliefs available to shareholders
	- IHT: Business Property Relief and instalment option
	- CGT: BAD dependent on the company being a "personal trading company"; hard to establish if shares quoted.

# Limited Liability Partnership

Created by Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000.

Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of the Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2009 regulates the application of CA 2006 to LLPs.

- Partners have limited liability.
- IA 1986 and CDDA 1986 applicable.
- s 8 LLPA 2000: must be at least 2 designated members

## Registration

Send to Companies House:

1. Incorporation document. Must contain (s 2(2)) LLPA 2000):
	1. Name
	2. Country
	3. Address
	4. Names and addresses of members
	5. Identities of designated members
	6. Statements of initial PSCs
2. A form containing a statement that the requirements of s 2(1)(a) have been complied with, including that two or more partners must have subscribed their names.

Then Companies House issues a certificate of registration. Name must end with “limited liability partnership” or “LLP”.

## Position of Members

- Members will owe a duty to the LLP as a body corporate in common law, but it seems unclear whether they owe a duty of good faith to each other.
- Members are agents of the LLP, under s 6 of the LLPA 2000
- Relationship between members governed byy s 5 LLPA 2000.
- No restriction on membership numbers, just there must be at least 2 members. Open to any type of business (s 2(1)(a) LPPA 2000).
- Members have limited liability
- Separate legal personality
	- LLP can be liable for torts and debts.
	- Continues to exist even when there are not two or more members.

## Miscellaneous

- Accounts
	- An LLP must file annual accounts, which are then public documents.
- Insolvency
	- Wrongful and fraudulent trading provisions apply to members of an LLP.
- Conversion
	- LLP -> Ltd is not a valid conversion.
- Tax
	- Treated as an ordinary partnership
	- The partners will be liable to income tax under the ITTOIA 2005 for their share of profits, and to capital gains tax on gains made on the disposal of partnership assets.

## Formalities

- Requirement to have name, place of registration, registration number and address of registered office on business stationery (s 82 CA 2006)
- Must have a registered office (LLPA 2000, Sch, para 6)
- Contract may be made on behalf of an LLP by anyone acting with express or implied authority
- Can change name at any time – no prescribed procedure for doing so.
	- Advisable to include a procedure in the [[Partnership Agreement]] addressing this.
	- Else consent of all members needed (LLP Regulations 2001, regs 7&8)
- Send Registrar an annual confirmation statement (ss 854-855 CA 2006)
	- Address of registered office
	- Names and addresses of members
	- Identity of designated members
	- Address where the register of debenture holders is kept, if not the registered office.

## Authority of a Member to Bind

Section 6(2) provides for limitations to be placed on a member’s actual authority. So, an LLP is not bound if the member has no authority to act for the LLP in that matter and the third party in question knows that fact.

```ad-question
title: Apparent authority
The extent of the apparent authority will be determined by the nature of the business concerned, and therefore what constitutes the ‘normal course’ of that business.
```

## Property and Charges

An LLP can issue debentures and grant fixed/ floating charges.

- Every LLP must keep a copy of every charge requiring registration at its registered office (CA 2006, s 859P), freely available to creditors/ members.
- Must also register charges with the Registrar for Companies. The court can rectify omission of registration for a charge (s 859M CA 2006).

## New Members

Admitting members is a contractual matter - new members can be admitted with the agreement of existing embers.

## Limited Liability

If the LLP becomes insolvent, the LLP and members will be subject to IA 1986 wrt company liquidation. There is the possibility of the member being found liable for misfeasance, fraudulent or wrongful trading.

Fewer restrictions on the right of action of members. The Court of Appeal held in [[Feetum v Levy [2005] EWCA Civ 1601]] that the rule in *Foss v Harbottle* did not prevent members of an LLP from challenging the appointment of administrative receivers.

## LLP Agreement

```ad-statute
title: s 5 LLPA 2000
(1) Except as far as otherwise provided by this Act or any other enactment, the mutual rights and duties of the members of a limited liability partnership, and the mutual rights and duties of a limited liability partnership and its members, shall be governed—
- (a) by agreement between the members, or between the limited liability partnership and its members, or
- (b) in the absence of agreement as to any matter, by any provision made in relation to that matter by regulations under section 15(c).

(2) An agreement made before the incorporation of a limited liability partnership between the persons who subscribe their names to the incorporation document may impose obligations on the limited liability partnership (to take effect at any time after its incorporation).

```

Some default rules:

1. sharing in capital and profits (PA 1890, s 24(1));
2. indemnity to members (s 24(2));
3. right to take part in management (s 24(5));
4. no entitlement to remuneration (s 24(6));
5. introduction of a new member and voluntary assignment of a member’s interest (s 24(7));
6. ordinary matters connected with the business to be decided by majority (s 24(8));
7. books and records to be available for inspection by any member (s 24(9));
8. each member to render true accounts and full information to any member (s 28);
9. obligation to account to the LLP for any profits made from a competing business without consent (s 30);
10. obligation to account to the LLP for any private benefit derived without consent from use of LLP property (s 29(1)); and
11. no majority power to expel without express agreement as to such power (s 25).

## Designated Members

$\geq 2$ members of the LLP must be ‘designated members’ (LLPA 2000, ss 2(1)(a), 8(2)). These will be the original subscribers, unless specified otherwise ( 8(4)(b) LLPA 2000).

Responsibilities:

1. sign and file the annual accounts with the Registrar (CA 2006, s 444(6));
2. appoint, remove and remunerate auditors (CA 2006, s 485(4));
3. file the confirmation statement (CA 2006, s 854);
4. send notices to the Registrar, for example concerning a member leaving or joining the LLP (LLPA 2000, s 9(1));
5. send a statement of release of a charge to the Registrar (CA 2006, s 859L);
6. apply for a change of name of the LLP (LLPA 2000, Sch, para 5(2)(b));
7. apply to strike off the LLP from the register (CA 2006, s 1003); or
8. wind up the LLP or apply for a voluntary arrangement (IA 1986, s 89(1)).

## Member Duties

These include:

- Duty to account for money received on behalf of the LLP
- Duty not to apply LLP monies improperly
- Fiduciary duties (e.g., good faith)
- Duties on members as a whole
- Duties on individual members
- Duties to the member's co-members

## Capital and Profits

By default, members entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the LLP. Default rules do not deal with the losses – LLP itself bears the losses. The only thing the member has at risk is:

1. The member's capital
2. Any profits due to the member
3. Any loans from the member which the LLP cannot repay.

## Management and Decisions

Default rules 3 and 4 provide that every member may take part in the management of the LLP, and that no member is entitled to remuneration for doing so. These can be varied.

Default rule 6: ordinary matters decided by a majority of the members. No change in the nature of the business without the consent of all members.

## Cessation of Membership

A person may cease to be a member of an LLP by giving reasonable notice to the other members (LLPA 2000, s 4(3)) – no equivalent provision in a traditional partnership.

A member cannot be expelled or be required to retire, unless the LLP agreement deals with this (default rule 8).

No automatic right for a lending member to be  
repaid their capital.

## Pros and Cons

Advantages:

- Limited liability and separate legal personality
- Flexible organisational structure
- The ability to grant fixed and floating charges
- Ability to appoint an administrator

Disadvantages:

- Requirement to file accounts
- Insolvency clawback provisions
- Transfer of a personal interest in LLP possible but complicated
- LLP cannot convert into Ltd.
