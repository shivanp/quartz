## Basics

 - Businesses can be incorporated or unincorporated
- Unincorporated
	- Sole trader
	- Partnership
- Incorporated
	- Private limited company
	- Public limited company
	- Limited liability partnership

### Sole Trader

- No formal steps needed to set up
- But must register with HMRC for tax purposes
- A professional running their own business is usually called a 'sole practitioner'.
- Sole proprietor also used
- Note a sole trader can have employees, so long as they own the entire business.
- Pay income tax as a self-employed person.
- Personally liable for all debts of the business: the business has no separate legal personality.

### Partnership

- Two or more people running and owning a business together.
- Governed by Partnership Act 1890
	- s 1: A partnership is legally formed when two or more persons carry on a business with a view to making a profit.
- Partnership run on the basis of a contract – can be oral or written
- No formalities to be satisfied.
- Each partner must register with HMRC for tax purposes.
	- In a partnership of individuals, partners taxed separately as self-employed individuals, paying income tax on their share of the profits of the partnership.
- Partnership has no separate legal status
	- Partners have unlimited liability for debts
	- Joint and several liability.

> [!summary]  
> Partners share:
> 1. Right to make decisions
> 2. Ownership of assets of the business (unless otherwise stated)
> 3. Profits of business
> 4. Unlimited liability for business debts

### Limited Partnership

- Form of unincorporated business
- Established under Limited Partnerships Act 1907 (LPA 1907)
- Structure:
	- Must be at least one general partner who has unlimited lability for all the debts of the partnership
	- Can also have limited partner(s) whose liability is limited to the amount they initially invested in the business, so long as the limited partner is:
		1. Not controlling or managing the LP
		2. Not having the power to take binding decisions on behalf of the LP
		3. Not removing their contribution to the LP for as long as it is in business.
	- If breached, partner becomes a general partner with unlimited liability.
- Not very popular as a business structure until recently, where they have made a comeback.
- Now used for some investment funds and VC funds because very lightly regulated and may be no need to make financial information available to the public.
- Registration:
	- LPs must be registered with the Registrar of Companies in accordance with s 8 LPA 1907 before they can start to trade
	- Application form containing details set out in s 8A LPA 1907 (names of partners, nature of business) must be completed and signed by all partners.
- “LP” at the end of the company name
- Since Apr 2017, can also set up a Private Fund LP (PFLP).
	- Only available to private investment funds which do not deal with members of the public.
	- Financial and administrative benefits
	- Created to win business from Luxembourg
- Rules governing LPs set to be tightened in [Economic Crimes Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/10/contents) to combat abuse of LP for money laundering.
	- LP used in EUR 200bn Danske Bank scandal.
	- Ukraine Russian laundromat etc. gives political agenda.

### Contractual Cooperation

- Possible for two or more parties to run a business on the basis of a cooperation agreement between them
- Less formal than a partnership
- Used for e.g., contracting to jointly explore and develop oil and gas fields.
- Often called joint ventures
- Terms of agreement can be kept confidential
- But lack of identity, lack of organisational structure and dangers of becoming a partnership by fulfilling s 1 PA 1890.

To avoid carrying on business ‘in common’ the participants must not merge their separate businesses, or more to the point, create a single business out of the venture. They may avoid the implication of carrying on a business in common if each participant retains legal and beneficial ownership of and operational control over their respective assets whilst pursuing the venture.

If they do retain ownership and control of their own assets the participants may decide, rather than share profits, to share gross returns, which is the turnover they generate through the joint venture. Sharing gross returns does not by itself infer a partnership.

In summary, the lesson of accidental partnerships is to regulate a venture with a formal agreement and in the process create or avoid a partnership as required having regard to the essential elements of the definition in section 1 of the Act.

### Company

- CA 2006 hunny
- Solicitors could not previously operate as a company, but this changed under the [Legal Services Act 2007](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/29/contents) (the “Tesco law”).
- Company has a **separate legal personality**
	- Recognised in law as a legal person
	- Directors run the company on a daily basis
- Register company
	- File documentation with the Registrar of Companies at Companies House
	- Fee is as low as £10
	- Once the company is successfully registered, the Registrar will issue a certificate of incorporation: company is then legally in existence
- Subject to corporation tax
- Must register with HMRC for corporation tax purposes, and usually as an employer for PAYE and National Insurance purposes.

### Unlimited Company

> [!defn] Unlimited company
> A company which does not limit the liability of its members (s 3(4) CA 2006)

Very rare; one example is Land Rover pre-2013.

A key advantage is that company finances do not need to be made public.

### Limited Company

> [!defn]
> A company in which the liability of its members is limited by its constitution (CA 2006 s 3(1)). 

#### Limiting Liability

Limited company may limit liability:

1. By shares, or
2. By guarantee.

Limiting by guarantee is rare and usually applies to non-profits like charities, professional societies and property management companies (e.g., Bupa, Network Rail, Oxfam).

So the members guarantee that if the company is liquidated they will pay a specified sum to creditors under s 3(3) CA 2006. The owners' liability is usually limited to £1.

Can be easier to make changes to ownership than in a company limited by shares.

#### Private Limited Companies

Almost all companies are private limited companies. One of the biggest is Iceland.

> [!defn] Private limited company
> Any company that is not a public company (s 4(1))

An Ltd cannot raise money from members of the public at large by issuing securities such as shares (s 755 CA 2006).

#### Public Limited Company

Defined by s 4(2) CA 2006. Must be:

- A company limited by shares or guarantee
- Have a share capital complying with the requirements of CA 2006 to enable it to be registered as such.

Also require:

- Constitution to state it is a public company
- 'plc' on the end of the company name
- Owners of the company must invest a specified minimum in the company

#### Publicly Traded Company

A public company may apply to join a UK stock market. Note that not all do. Two main markets are:

- London Stock Exchange's Main Market
- Alternative Investment Market

> [!warning]
> There is no obligation on a public company to join a stock market. Those which choose not to are called unlisted (e.g., John Lewis)

#### Main Market

- Principal stock market.
- Must complete an IPO
	- Lots of conditions and need to publicly disclose lots of information.
	- One condition is being admitted to the FCA's Official List
	- Such companies are often known as 'listed companies'
- Followed by onerous ongoing requirements.
	- Mainly apply to FCA's handbook
	- Do not apply to public companies which haven't joined the Main Market

#### AIM

- LSO's alternative investment market
- Separate from Main Market
- Now there is increasing competition between the two markets
- e.g., ASOS is on AIM
- Subject to AIM rules

### Public Vs Private Companies

Legal differences:

- s 755 CA 2006: only a public company can offer its shares to the public at large
- s 154 CA 2006: a public company must have at least two directors
- CA 2006 also has provisions which only apply to publicly-traded companies rather than unlisted, and provisions which only apply to Main Market companies rather than AIM ones.

Practical differences:

- Possible for a private company to be owned by a single shareholder and managed by a single director (who might be the same person).

## Other Types of Company

There are a number of other, less common forms of company.

### Community Interest Company

CIC is a form of limited liability company, intended for businesses that wish to use their profits and assets for the public good. CIC has altruistic, charitable aims and uses a business to improve communities rather than make money. Such companies are governed by the Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act 2004, and set up under the formalities of the CA 2006.

### Charitable Incorporated Organisation

The Charities Act 2006 introduced the broad legal framework for a new legal form of corporate structure which is designed specifically for charities, the charitable incorporated organisation (CIO). The Charitable Incorporated Organisations (General) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/3012) set out the detail on how they will be established and operated.

The CIO is intended to provide the advantages of a corporate structure, such as reduced risk of personal liability, without this burden of dual regulation. It is not subject to company law and is regulated only by the Charities Commission. The first new CIOs were registered on 3 January 2013, and rules allow existing charities to convert to CIOs. There are now approximately 25,000 CIOs in existence at the time of writing.

### UK Societas

The UK Societas is a product of Brexit. Whilst the UK was a member of the EU, it was possible for a UK registered company to form a European public company in accordance with EU Regulation 2157/2001 on the Statute for a European Company. These companies are known as Societas Europaea (SE). They are a single company, or a group of companies, operating in different EU Member States which can operate as a single corporate entity subject to one set of rules valid in all Member States.

The European Public Limited-Liability Company (Amendment etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 amended the Regulation and the European Public Limited Liability Company Regulations 2004 (SI 2004/2326) which supplemented it in the UK. As a result, the UK registered SEs (of which there were only about 25 in existence) were converted into a new corporate form, the UK Societas. The UK Societas is only intended to be a temporary corporate form whilst it decides on which other UK corporate structure to adopt. There is, however, no deadline for this transformation to take place. It is not possible to set up a UK Societas from scratch.

### UK Establishment by Overseas Companies

Applies to a pre-existing foreign company that wishes to operate in the UK and set up a regular physical presence. Law set out in the Overseas Companies Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/1801).

All overseas companies that set up a branch (as defined in the 11th EU Company Law Directive 89/666/EEC) or any other place of business in the UK must register selected details of the establishment within one month of its opening.

Registration is not required if the overseas company does not have a physical presence in the UK. There are currently approximately 13,000 overseas companies with a UK establishment. In order to register, the overseas company must submit a registration application form, OS IN01.

### Company Formed by Special Act of Parliament

Historically, trading companies were sometimes established by a special Act of Parliament.

### Company Formed by Royal Charter

Company formed under the prerogative powers of the monarch by letters patent without using the powers of Parliament. The right to form a company this way does remain (s 1040 CA 2006).

## Limited Liability Partnership

A limited liability partnership (LLP) is formed under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000. However, the LLP is run with the informality and flexibility afforded by a partnership, and the partners are taxed as if the business were a partnership rather than a company.

Limited liability partnerships can be formed only by two or more members carrying on a lawful business with a view of profit.

### UKEIG

Whilst the UK was a member of the EU, it was possible for UK-based businesses to form a European economic interest grouping (EEIG). These are designed to enable businesses (or other entities such as universities) to form and maintain links with businesses from other EU Member States. In effect they are alliances between businesses in different Member States that wish to operate together across national borders.

Pursuant to the European Economic Interest Grouping (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018, these were converted into a new corporate form, the UKEIG. These are only intended to be a temporary corporate form whilst  
the UKEIG decides on which other structure to adopt. There is, however, no deadline for this transformation to take place. It is not possible to set up a UKEIG from scratch.

## Choosing Type

Ask:

- Can the entrepreneur set up this type of business?
	- Partnership and LLP require $\geq 2$ owners to exist
	- Public company requires $\geq 2$ directors
	- s 157 CA 2006: a person under 16 cannot be the director of a company.
	- Undischarged bankrupt person/ disqualified director under CDDA 1986 cannot be directors
- How much tax will the entrepreneur pay?
- What is the entrepreneur's attitude to risk?
	- LLP and Ltd have separate legal personalities
	- But remember that in practice people dealing with these forms of businesses will usually seek personal guarantees from owners anyway.
	- Risks in running a company due to the high level of regulation imposed by CA 2006 and other legislation.
	- Breach of directors' duties etc.
- What formalities are required?
	- Time and cost to incorporate (though admittedly minimal)
	- Partnership will require partnership agreement, and therefore legal fees.
	- A bigger issue is compliance with formalities after the business has been set up. Generally less for an LLP than a company.
	- LLPs have more flexibility in decision-making.
- Does the entrepreneur want to reveal information publicly?
	- Companies and LLPs must by law reveal a certain amount of information.
- How much will it cost to set up and run the business?
	- Sole trader or partnership may be set up without any costs.
	- Complying with CA regulations costs money
- Does status matter?
	- Company and LLP can offer a floating charge as a form of security for loans.
	- Companies have a wider pool of potential investors.
