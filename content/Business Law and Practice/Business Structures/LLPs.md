# Limited Liability Partnership

Created by Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000.

Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of the Companies Act 2006) Regulations 2009 regulates the application of CA 2006 to LLPs.

- Partners have limited liability.
- IA 1986 and CDDA 1986 applicable.
- s 8 LLPA 2000: must be at least 2 designated members

## Registration

Send to Companies House:

1. Incorporation document. Must contain (s 2(2)) LLPA 2000):
	1. Name
	2. Country
	3. Address
	4. Names and addresses of members
	5. Identities of designated members
	6. Statements of initial PSCs
2. A form containing a statement that the requirements of s 2(1)(a) have been complied with, including that two or more partners must have subscribed their names.

Then Companies House issues a certificate of registration. Name must end with “limited liability partnership” or “LLP”.

## Position of Members

- Members will owe a duty to the LLP as a body corporate in common law, but it seems unclear whether they owe a duty of good faith to each other.
- Members are agents of the LLP, under s 6 of the LLPA 2000
- Relationship between members governed byy s 5 LLPA 2000.
- No restriction on membership numbers, just there must be at least 2 members. Open to any type of business (s 2(1)(a) LPPA 2000).
- Members have limited liability
- Separate legal personality
	- LLP can be liable for torts and debts.
	- Continues to exist even when there are not two or more members.

## Miscellaneous

- Accounts
	- An LLP must file annual accounts, which are then public documents.
- Insolvency
	- Wrongful and fraudulent trading provisions apply to members of an LLP.
- Conversion
	- LLP -> Ltd is not a valid conversion.
- Tax
	- Treated as an ordinary partnership
	- The partners will be liable to income tax under the ITTOIA 2005 for their share of profits, and to capital gains tax on gains made on the disposal of partnership assets.

## Formalities

- Requirement to have name, place of registration, registration number and address of registered office on business stationery (s 82 CA 2006)
- Must have a registered office (LLPA 2000, Sch, para 6)
- Contract may be made on behalf of an LLP by anyone acting with express or implied authority
- Can change name at any time – no prescribed procedure for doing so.
	- Advisable to include a procedure in the [[Partnership Agreement]] addressing this.
	- Else consent of all members needed (LLP Regulations 2001, regs 7&8)
- Send Registrar an annual confirmation statement (ss 854-855 CA 2006)
	- Address of registered office
	- Names and addresses of members
	- Identity of designated members
	- Address where the register of debenture holders is kept, if not the registered office.

## Authority of a Member to Bind

Section 6(2) provides for limitations to be placed on a member’s actual authority. So, an LLP is not bound if the member has no authority to act for the LLP in that matter and the third party in question knows that fact.

> [!question] Apparent authority
> The extent of the apparent authority will be determined by the nature of the business concerned, and therefore what constitutes the ‘normal course’ of that business.

## Property and Charges

An LLP can issue debentures and grant fixed/ floating charges.

- Every LLP must keep a copy of every charge requiring registration at its registered office (CA 2006, s 859P), freely available to creditors/ members.
- Must also register charges with the Registrar for Companies. The court can rectify omission of registration for a charge (s 859M CA 2006).

## New Members

Admitting members is a contractual matter - new members can be admitted with the agreement of existing embers.

## Limited Liability

If the LLP becomes insolvent, the LLP and members will be subject to IA 1986 wrt company liquidation. There is the possibility of the member being found liable for misfeasance, fraudulent or wrongful trading.

Fewer restrictions on the right of action of members. The Court of Appeal held in [[Feetum v Levy [2005] EWCA Civ 1601]] that the rule in *Foss v Harbottle* did not prevent members of an LLP from challenging the appointment of administrative receivers.

## LLP Agreement

> [!statute] s 5 LLPA 2000
> (1) Except as far as otherwise provided by this Act or any other enactment, the mutual rights and duties of the members of a limited liability partnership, and the mutual rights and duties of a limited liability partnership and its members, shall be governed—
> - (a) by agreement between the members, or between the limited liability partnership and its members, or
> - (b) in the absence of agreement as to any matter, by any provision made in relation to that matter by regulations under section 15(c).
> 
> (2) An agreement made before the incorporation of a limited liability partnership between the persons who subscribe their names to the incorporation document may impose obligations on the limited liability partnership (to take effect at any time after its incorporation).

Some default rules:

1. sharing in capital and profits (PA 1890, s 24(1));
2. indemnity to members (s 24(2));
3. right to take part in management (s 24(5));
4. no entitlement to remuneration (s 24(6));

## Designated Members

$\geq 2$ members of the LLP must be ‘designated members’ (LLPA 2000, ss 2(1)(a), 8(2)). These will be the original subscribers, unless specified otherwise ( 8(4)(b) LLPA 2000).

Responsibilities:

1. sign and file the annual accounts with the Registrar (CA 2006, s 444(6));
2. appoint, remove and remunerate auditors (CA 2006, s 485(4));
3. file the confirmation statement (CA 2006, s 854);
4. send notices to the Registrar, for example concerning a member leaving or joining the LLP (LLPA 2000, s 9(1));
5. send a statement of release of a charge to the Registrar (CA 2006, s 859L);
6. apply for a change of name of the LLP (LLPA 2000, Sch, para 5(2)(b));
7. apply to strike off the LLP from the register (CA 2006, s 1003); or
8. wind up the LLP or apply for a voluntary arrangement (IA 1986, s 89(1)).

## Member Duties

These include:

- Duty to account for money received on behalf of the LLP
- Duty not to apply LLP monies improperly
- Fiduciary duties (e.g., good faith)
- Duties on members as a whole
- Duties on individual members
- Duties to the member's co-members

## Capital and Profits

By default, members entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the LLP. Default rules do not deal with the losses – LLP itself bears the losses. The only thing the member has at risk is:

1. The member's capital
2. Any profits due to the member
3. Any loans from the member which the LLP cannot repay.

## Management and Decisions

Default rules 3 and 4 provide that every member may take part in the management of the LLP, and that no member is entitled to remuneration for doing so. These can be varied.

Default rule 6: ordinary matters decided by a majority of the members. No change in the nature of the business without the consent of all members.

## Cessation of Membership

A person may cease to be a member of an LLP by giving reasonable notice to the other members (LLPA 2000, s 4(3)) – no equivalent provision in a traditional partnership.

A member cannot be expelled or be required to retire, unless the LLP agreement deals with this (default rule 8).

No automatic right for a lending member to be  
repaid their capital.

- The ability to grant fixed and floating charges
