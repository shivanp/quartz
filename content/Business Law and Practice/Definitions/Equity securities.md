# Equity securities

[s 560 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/560) defines “equity securities” as:  
(a) ordinary shares in the company, or  
(b) rights to subscribe for, or to convert securities into, ordinary shares in the company;

Note that this means a share which is participating in any way is an equity security. Only not an equity security if it is completely fixed. If it is not fixed/ participating in any way, the new shares being issued become equity securities under the definition. If there is any uncapped element whatsoever then it is an equity security.
