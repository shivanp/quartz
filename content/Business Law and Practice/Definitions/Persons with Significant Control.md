# Persons with Significant Control

Individual who

- Owns >25% of shares or voting rights (note strict inequality)
- Has power to appoint or remove a majority of board of directors
- otherwise exercises significant influence or control over company

Companies must maintain registers of PSCs open to public inspection ([ss 790A - 790ZG CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/790A)). This increases transparency and helps combat tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.

PSC register must also be filed at Companies House along with confirmation statement (annual statement confirming constitution and details).
