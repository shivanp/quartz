# debt-for-equity swaps

		   

A popular restructuring method is a debt for equity swap; financial creditors receive equity in the restructured vehicle in return for reducing or cancelling their debt claims against the company (and the rest of the group).

The debt for equity swap reduces balance sheet liabilities and allows lenders to take some of the upside following a restructuring once the company returns to profit (as equity holders, entitled to dividends once there are sufficient distributable reserves) or on any subsequent sale.
