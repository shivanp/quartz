# Misfeasance

## Misfeasance

[[Directors]] owe duties to the company under s 171178 CA 2006. [[Breach]] of any such duties is generally actionable by the company, though [[Business Law and Practice/Company Law/Shareholders]] may be able to bring a claim for [[Unfair Prejudice]], [[just and equitable winding up]], or [[derivative claims]] on behalf of the company.

On a winding up, typically the liquidator brings an action against the directors under [s 212 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/212) for any breaches of duty committed by them.

s 212 does not create any new liability or rights, but simply provides a summary procedure to enable the company (acting by its liquidators) to pursue claims against directors who have breached their duties.

Where a person's liability is established, the court may order that person to compensate the company in respect of the money or property misapplied.

### Bringing a Claim

A claim may be brought by:

- A liquidator
- The Official Receiver
- Any creditor or contributory

The burden of proof is on the claimants to establish misfeasance on the part of the director/ other defendant ([[Mullarkey v Broad [2008] 1 BCLC 638]]).

### Against Whom May a Claim Be Brought?

s 212(1): a claim in misfeasance may be brought against:

1. Any person who is or has been an officer of the company (including present or former directors, managers or secretaries of the company)
2. Any others who acted in the promotion, formation or management of the company; and
3. A liquidator or administrative receiver (a claim for misfeasance can also be brought against an administrator under Schedule B1 to the IA 1986).

See [[Re Centralcrest Engineering Co Ltd [2000] BCC 727]] for claim against liquidator.

### Scope

Covers the whole spectrum of directors' duties. Includes:

- Misapplication of any money or assets of the company
- Breach of a statutory provision or duty, e.g.,
	- Unlawful loans to a director;
	- Director entering contract with his own company and failing to notify board ([s 177 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/177));
	- Failing to seek prior [[General Meeting]] approval where a director has entered into a substantial property transaction ([s 190 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/190)); and
	- A director failing to act within his powers ([s 171 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/171))
	- Directors responsible for transactions at an undervalue as provided in s 238 or preferences as provided in s 239 may thereby commit a misfeasance;
	- Breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence, i.e., in negligence ([s 174 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/174)).

### Remedies

The court will examine the conduct of the director/ other person against whom the claim for misfeasance has been brought, and make an order for repayment, restoration or contribution to the company's assets as it thinks just.

The director may claim relief under [s 1157 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1157), where the court is satisfied that the director acted honestly and reasonably, and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused.

A finding of misfeasance is also a relevant factor when the court considers whether to make a disqualification order against a director for unfitness under [s 6 Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/46/section/6).

### Ratification

Ratification by the shareholders under [s 239 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/239) can usually absolve the directors from personal liability for breach of duty. Ratification at a time when the company is solvent should preclude misfeasance proceedings.

When a company is facing insolvency, duties of directors shift towards the company's creditors, and away from the members as a whole (per case law). Rationale: in these circumstances, creditors are the ones who stand to lose if the directors breach their duties.

**Not** possible for shareholders to ratify breach of directors' duties at a time when the company's fortunes have declined to the extent that there is a reasonable possibility of the company going insolvent (s 239(7) CA 2006).
