# Companies

Companies are the most popular business model in England and Wales. There were over 3 million private limited companies registered with Companies House in 2018.

## Key Features

- A company is a separate legal entity – so can own property, enter into contracts, can sue, can be sued. P&L belong to the company, not the shareholders.
- Limited liability: shareholders only liable for the amount unpaid on their shares – massively protects shareholders and facilitates investment.
- Governed by Companies Act 2006.  
- Formal procedural requirements can be onerous for small businesses.

## Roles

See also [[Company stakeholders]].

### Shareholders

- Owners of company
- Invest money in return for shares and the possibility of dividends
- Not involved in day-to-day management
- Have voting rights and control key decisions

### Subscribers

The first shareholders in a company who invest when it is incorporated.

### Directors

- Officers/ managers of the company
- Day to day running
- Collectively known as the Board

### Persons with Significant Control

- Shareholders with > 25% of shares for small companies (see FCA for deets).
- Details of PSCs must be provided to Companies House.

Any individual (human) who

- Owns more than 25% of shares or voting rights of the company; or
- Has the power to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors; or
- Otherwise exercises 'significant influence or control' over the company

## Companies Act 2006

- Replaces Companies Act 1985
- Aimed to simplify the law for private companies.
- Removal of AGM requirement or submission of annual returns for [[Private companies]] (this has been replaced with a simpler annual Confirmation Statement)
- Codification of directors' duties, so that directors of small private companies can more easily understand their obligations.
- Allowing [[Private companies]] to pass shareholder [[Resolutions]] in writing, dispensing of the requirement for General Meetings.

Rules for [[Business Law and Practice/Company Law/Business models/Public companies]] are much more onerous.
