# Capital Gains Tax

```toc
```

Distinguish CGT with income tax. Capital Gains Tax is a one-off tax on the difference in value of an asset when acquired and when disposed of.

Introduced in 1965 to stop people avoiding income tax. Statute: Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.

> [!defn]
> Capital gains tax is charged on the chargeable gains made by a chargeable person on the disposal of chargeable assets in a tax year (6th April - 5th April)

## Calculation

1. Identify the chargeable disposal
	- A chargeable person
		- Individuals
		- Trustees
		- Personal representatives
		- Partners in a business.
	- Makes a chargeable disposal
		- Dispose giving ordinary meaning
		- Divesting/ change of ownership
		- Gift is chargeable disposal–taxed as if the asset had been sold at market value.
		- Does not include death; PRs get all the assets inclusive of all increase in value.
	- Of a chargeable asset.
		- Excluded: motor vehicles, national savings certificates and sterling.
2. Calculate the gain or loss
	1. Proceeds of disposal
		1. Sale price/ market value where the disposal is a gift/ sale at an undervalue.
	2. Minus incidental costs of disposal
		1. e.g., stockbroker fees/ estate agent commission.
	3. Minus initial expenditure and incidental costs
		1. Solicitor & accountant fees
	4. Minus subsequent expenditure
		1. e.g., cost of building extension on property
		2. Legal fees incurred in defending asset, e.g., family dispute.
3. Consider reliefs
	1. Non-business assets
		1. Main dwelling home–v important exception.
	2. Business assets (aims to encourage investment)
		1. Hold over relief–gifts on qualifying assets. Donor has no CGT liability; donee has no liability until they dispose of the asset at some time in the future.
		2. Roll over relief on incorporation
			1. e.g., sole trader selling assets to a company in return for shares. The gain made on disposal of business is rolled into the shares.
		3. Roll over relief on replacement of qualifying business assets. Postpones payment of CGT on the old asset until disposal of the replacement asset.
		4. Business asset disposal relief.
			1. Limits tax on qualifying gain to a flat rate of 10%.
4. Aggregate gains and deduct annual exemption
	1. Annual exemption currently £12,300
	2. Basic rate: 10%, higher rate: 20%
		1. If an individual’s gains and taxable income added together do not exceed the threshold for basic rate income tax (£37,700), the rate of tax on the gains is 10%.
		2. If an individual’s gains and taxable income added together exceed the basic rate income tax threshold, any part of the gains up to the basic rate threshold is taxed at 10%, but the rate of tax on the gains that exceed the threshold is 20%.
	3. Plus 8% surcharge on residential property other than main dwelling.
	4. Business Asset Disposal Relief: flat 10% rate.
5. Apply correct rate of tax.
	- Gains are treated as if they were the top slice of the taxpayer’s income for the tax year.
	- Gains realised by trustees and personal representatives are taxed at a flat rate of 20% (or 28% on residential property).

## Special Rule

Disposals between spouses/ civil partners:

- No gain/ no loss
- Gain deferred: recipient spouse treated to have received the asset on the other spouse's acquisition cost, so will pay CGT on the combined increase in value when the asset is sold. Important tax planning point.

## Paying

- Assessed on the aggregate net gain of the current tax year, so must consider all disposals made during the tax year.
- Tax for individuals payable on/ before 31 January.
- Must also submit provisional calculations of any gains made from sale of residential property and pay tax due within 30 days of completion of the sale.

## Disposals

### Sale or Gift

Must have been a disposal of a chargeable asset. Disposal includes sale or gift. If a gift is made, the gain the taxpayer is deemed to have made on the asset is taxed. This is done using the market value of the asset at the time of gifting.

A sale/ gift of part of an asset also counts as a disposal.

But on death there is no disposal, so there is no charge to CGT. PRs acquire assets at the market value at the date of death (probate value). This wipes out gains accrued during deceased's lifetime–so these gains are not taxed.

## Calculation of Gains

The gain is generally the consideration for the disposal less expenditures:

- Initial expenditure
	- Cost price of asset
		- Or market value at date of acquisition if gifted
		- Or probate value if acquired through will/ intestacy
	- Incidental costs of acquisition
		- Legal fees, valuation fees, stamp duty.
- Subsequent expenditure
	- Renovations/ extensions.
	- Expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred in establishing, preserving or defending title to the asset.
- Incidental costs of disposal
	- e.g., legal fees, estate agent fees.

> [!note]
> Expenditure deductible for income tax purposes not deductible for capital gains purposes.

### Indexation Allowance

Applies to gains realised before 6 April 2008, if asset had been owned between 31 March 1982 and 5 April 1998. Tried to remove inflationary gains. Not super relevant.

### Pre-31 March 1982

When a taxpayer has owned an asset since before this date, the gain which accrued before 31/03/82 is excluded from CGT calculations.

## Reliefs

### Tangible Moveable Property

Wasting assets - those with a predictable life $<50$ years - generally exempt.

Other tangible moveable property which goes up in value will be exempt from CGT if the disposal consideration is $\leq £6,000$.

### Private Dwelling House

A gain on the disposal by an individual of a dwelling house, including grounds of up to half a hectare, will be completely **exempt**, provided it has been occupied as their only or main residence through their period of ownership (ignoring the last 9 months of ownership).

### Damages for Personal Injury

Exempt from CGT. Note recovery or compensation can generally amount to the disposal of a chargeable asset.

### Hold-over Relief

Enables an individual to gift certain types of business asset without paying CGT. But then when the donee disposes of the asset, they will be charged CGT on both gains. Both the donor and donee must agree to claim hold-over relief.

### 'Roll-over' Relief

Also known as relief for replacement of business assets. Encourages expansion and investment in qualifying business assets by enabling the sale of those assets without an immediate charge to CGT, providing the proceeds are invested in other qualifying business assets.

### Roll-over Relief on Incorporation

Defers a CGT charge. Applies when an individual sells their interest in an unincorporated business to a company. Gain rolled over into shares received as consideration for the interest sold and CGT charge postponed until disposal of shares.

### Re-investment in Unquoted Shares

An individual can defer payment of CGT on any chargeable gain if the proceeds of sale are re-invested in certain shares of an unquoted trading company.

### Business Asset Disposal Relief

Relief available on gains made by individuals on disposals of:

- All or part of a trading business the individual is a sole trader/ partner in
- Shares in a trading company, if the individual holds $\geq 5\%$ voting shares (+ other conditions)
	- Exceptions to definition of trading company:
		- Finance company
		- Landlord/ letting company
		- Something else
- Assets owned and used by individual's trading company/ partnership.

## Annual Exemption

First slice of taxpayer's net capital gains exempt. Taxpayer can apply to gains which would otherwise attract a higher rate (e.g., apply their exemption to sale of residential property, when they also have capital gains from shares).

Currently, £12,300.

## Business Relief

Many reliefs have a trading requirement: that the assets being disposed of/ acquired by use in a 'trade' or be shares in a 'trading company'.

### Roll-over Relief, Qualifying Business Assets

(ss 152-159 TCGA 1992)

Allows the CGT due on the disposal of a 'qualifying asset' to be effectively postponed when sale money is used to buy a replacement qualifying asset.

#### Conditions

- Qualifying assets (s 155 TCGA 1992)
	- Includes land, buildings and goodwill
	- Asset must be used in the trade of the business
	- Company shares not qualifying assets
	- Fixed plant and machinery is a qualifying asset, but will rarely produce a gain, and when they do, relief is restricted if they are wasted assets.
- Applies to disposal of qualifying asset owned by sole trader partnership, individual partner, individual shareholder (if own $\geq 5\%$). Must be used in the **trade** of the business.
- Time limits
	- Replacement asset must be acquired within 1 year before/ 3 years after disposal of original asset.

#### Application

If the relief applies, any liability to CGT from the disposal can be postponing by rolling-over the gain on the disposal into the acquisition cost of the replacement asset. This means that the gain is notionally deducted from the acquisition cost of the replacement asset to give a lower acquisition cost for use in subsequent CGT calculations.

Roll over relief applies in a modified form to businesses.

### Hold-over Relief on Gifts

Hold-over relief on gifts is available to an individual who disposes of ‘business assets’ by way of gift or, to the extent of the gift element, by way of sale at an undervalue.

Does not exempt any of the chargeable gain, but acts to postpone any tax liability. Aims to allow business assets to be given away without a tax charge on the donor.

#### Conditions

- Gift or gift element
- Only the gain relating to a chargeable business asset can be held over.
	- Assets used in the donor's trade
	- Shares in a trading company not listed on a recognised exchange
	- Shares in a personal trading company ($\geq 5\%$ holding)
	- Assets owned by shareholder and used in personal trading company.
- For relief to apply, both donor and donee must elect, within 4 years.

#### Application

Chargeable gain calculated in the usual way, then deducted from the market value of the asset to get the 'acquisition cost' for the donee.

When donee disposes of an asset, this 'acquisition cost' is deducted from the sale price or market value to find gain of the donee.

### Roll Over Relief on Incorporation

Where a business is transferred by a sole trader or individual partners to a new or established company in return for shares in the company, a disposal occurs for CGT purposes. Any gain on the disposal can be referred.

#### Conditions

- Business transferred as a going concern
- Whole gain can be rolled over only if consideration is all in shares issued by the company.
- Business must be transferred with all of its assets.

#### Application of Relief

Gain on disposal rolled over by notionally deducting from the acquisition cost of shares. Where conditions for relief are met, HMRC will automatically apply it unless the taxpayer elects not to use it.

### Business Asset Disposal Relief

Applies on disposal of certain business assets.

#### Conditions

"Personal trading company":

- Sole trader or partnership interests
	- Business disposed of as a going concern
	- Assets disposed of following cessation of business
	- Assets must have been used for the purpose of carrying out the business.
	- Business must have been owned by 2+ years.
- Company shares
	- Company is a personal trading company
	- Disponer is an employee officer of company.
- Associated disposals
	- Disposals of assets owned by an individual but used for the purposes of a business.

#### Application

Relief qualifies the gains concerned for a special tax rate of 10%. An individual cannot claim the relief for more than £1 million of qualifying gains. This is a lifetime restriction.

### Other Reliefs

- Investors' relief
	- Applies to gains made on disposal of qualifying shares in unlisted trading companies
	- Special 10% tax rate
	- £10 million lifetime cap
- Deferral relief on reinvestment in EIS shares
