# Administration and receivership

## Objectives of the Administrator

Administration is a procedure aiming to rescue a company which is insolvent if at all possible, or to achieve a better result for creditors if not.

It is a “collective procedure”, meaning the administrator acts in the interests of the creditors as a whole rather than on behalf of a particular creditor.

Outcomes of administration will differ depending on the circumstances. Some [[companies]] can be rescued which will then continue trading (e.g., Cath Kidston) but others proceed into liquidation (e.g., BHS went into administration in 2016, ultimately into liquidation).

Administrators are qualified insolvency practitioners, who can be appointed by the court or under the out-of-court procedure.

### Statutory Objectives

[s 8 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/8) and [Schedule B1 IA 1986](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/schedule/B1) set out the objectives of the administration.

State that an administrator

> “…must perform his functions with the objective of:  
> (a) rescuing the company as a going concern, or  
> (b) achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up…,  
> (c) realising the property in order to make a distribution to one or more secure or preferential creditors.”

These cascading objectives guide the actions of the administrator throughout the process. Objective (b) is most likely to be achieved.

## Appointment of Administrator

### Court Procedure

The court may appoint an administrator where the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts (Sch B1 para 12) on the application of:

- The company
- The [[directors]]
- One or more creditors.

The appointment may only be made where the order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of the administration (Sch B1 para 11(b)):

> The court may make an administration order in relation to a company only if satisfied—  
> (a) that the company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts, and  
> (b) that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration

See [[AA Mutual International Insurance Co Ltd [2004] EWHC Ch 1]].

### Out of Court Procedure

The following parties may appoint an administrator using the out-of-court procedure:

- The company or the [[directors]] (Sch B1 para 22 IA 1986); or
- A [[Qualifying Floating Charge]] holder.

The most common method of appointing an administrator is by directors using the out-of-court procedure.

> [!warning] Exception
> 
> Directors **cannot** use the out-of-court procedure where a creditor has presented a petition for the winding up of the company. The directors can then apply to court for an administration order, or the qualifying floating charge holder can use the out-of-court procedure to appoint an administrator. 

## Role of the Administrator

The administrator is an officer of the court. Owes their duty to all of the company's creditors to achieve the purposes of administration. The directors are unable to exercise any of their management powers without the consent of the administrator. The administrator takes on the running of the business with the aim of achieving the purpose of administration.

Once appointed, the administrator has up to eight weeks to produce a report setting out proposals for the future of a company's business. This is put to all creditors for approval.

| Proposal rejected                                    | Proposal accepted                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The company will usually be put into [[liquidation]]. | The administrator has several options, including restructuring the creditors' rights by implementing a CVA, so that the company exits administration. |

There is a 12-month fixed time limit for the completion of administrations. May be possible to obtain extensions. The administrator then reports back to the court with the outcome of administration.

## Moratorium

Key benefit: during administration, the company is given a **moratorium** (Sch B1 para 42-44 IA 1986). During this time, all business documents and the company website must state that the company is in administration.

During the moratorium (except with the consent of the court/ administrator):

1. No order or resolution to wind up the company can be made/ passed
2. No administrative receiver of the company can be appointed
3. No steps can be taken to enforce any [[security]] over the company's property, or to repossess goods subject to security, hire-purchase and retention of title;
4. No legal proceedings, execution or other process can be commenced or continued against the company or its property, and
5. A landlord cannot forfeit a lease of the company’s premises by means of peaceable re-entry.

## Administrator Powers

Administrators have wide powers to

> “do all such things as may be necessary for the management of the affairs, business and property of the company”

These include powers to:

- Remove and appoint directors (s 14, Sch 1 and para 61 Sch B1)
- Dispose of property subject to a floating charge (para 70 Sch B1);
- Dispose of property subject to a fixed charge (with the court's consent) (Para 71 Sch B1).

Additionally, the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (SBEEA 2015) granted additional powers to administrators to allow them to bring proceedings against directors for fraudulent and [[Wrongful trading]].

### Approach of the Court

In [[Re T & D Industries Ltd [2000] 1 LWR 646]], held that administration was meant to be a cheaper, more commercial alternative to liquidation, so the administrator had substantial autonomy to act without consulting the court.

## Pre-packaged Sales

A pre-packaged administration is where the business of an insolvent company is prepared for sale to a selected buyer, prior to the company's entry into administration. The agreed sale is carried out by an insolvency practitioner shortly after their appointment. Often the pre-pack purchaser will be one or more of the existing owners or directors of the insolvent company.

Pre-packaged sales are controversial, particularly where the sale is to existing members or management. The concern is that often creditors are given insufficient information to determine whether the sale was in their best interests. This concern led to calls for greater transparency, and the Association of Business Recovery Professionals issued a Statement of Insolvency Practice (SIP) in 2013, requiring clear, comprehensive and timely explanations to creditors following pre-packaged sales.

## Examples

> [!example] Debenhams
> 
> The UK department store group appointed administrators for a second time in May 2020 to protect itself from its creditors. The administrators were pursuing three strategies; a sale of the business, a restructure of the business and the wind-down of the business. Debenhams had heavy debts of around £600m.
> 
> Debenhams initially closed its Irish division, which had eleven stores, 958 staff and 300 concessions, and also closed its Hong Kong and Bangladeshi subsidiaries.
> 
> The Debenhams brand was bought by fashion retailer Boohoo for £55m in January 2021. The stores reopened to clear stock and then began to close. The last remaining UK stores closed in May 2021. The Debenhams brand continued its operations online as part of the internet-only fashion retailer Boohoo.

> [!example] Cath Kidston
> 
> The fashion and accessories chain appointed administrators in April 2020. Like many fashion retailers, the company had long-standing problems in maintaining sales and profitability. It lost £27m between 2018 – 2020, resulting in its closing stores and cutting head-office staff. There were 200 stores globally.
> 
> In May 2020, the company’s parent company, Baring Private Equity Asia, bought the company’s brand and online operations through a pre-packaged deal from the administrators. This led to the closure of all 60 UK stores, with the loss of 900 jobs. The company went on to trade in the UK as an online-only retailer.
> 
> In December 2020, Cath Kidston returned to the UK high street with the re-opening of its flagship store in London’s Piccadilly.

## Receivership

Whilst administration is a collective procedure; in contrast, receivership is an individual enforcement procedure which benefits only the appointing creditor.

When a particular creditor (for example, a bank) have significant control of a company’s assets, they have the power to call in ‘an administrative receiver’ if a floating charge that was granted before 15 September 2003 is breached. Whereas administration offers a possible route towards a return to profitability, receivership means the end of a company, often ending in liquidation.

There are different types of receivers.

### Fixed Charge Receivers

These are referred to colloquially as 'LPA receivers', though strictly this is only correct if they have been appointed pursuant to a mortgage.

Fixed charge receivers are appointed by the holders of a fixed charge pursuant to the terms of the security documentation. They are appointed to enforce the [[security]], and recover the debt that is owing to their appointor, often a bank. Owe duties primarily and exclusively to the appointor. They owe their duties primarily and exclusively to the appointor. The duty to the chargor is to act in good faith in the course of their appointment.

It is a legal anomaly that fixed charge receivers are usually an agent of the chargor. Usually have extensive powers set out in the security documentation and some limited powers under the Law of Property Act 1925. These typically include the ability to sell, mortgage and collect rent.

### Administration Vs Receivership

- Administration can be the result of a company decision, whereas receivership is something enforced by a creditor
- Administration offers protection against creditors and legal action; receivership does not.
- Administrators have a responsibility to all the company’s creditors whereas administrative receivers have the single goal of ensuring payment of the security interest that the organisation that appointed them has in the organisation.
- Administrative Receivership is now significantly less common. Its use has been heavily curtailed, following the passing of the [Enterprise Act 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/40/contents) which attempted to priorities less harsh insolvency solutions
