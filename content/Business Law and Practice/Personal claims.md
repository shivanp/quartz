# Personal claims

## Introduction

Claims brought by members in relation to wrongs done to them personally. The member may bring a personal or representative action (under general principles of contract or tort law), or one of the statutory remedies (unfair prejudice under s 994 CA 2006 or just and equitable winding up under s 122 Insolvency Act 1986).

Shareholders may also bring a personal claim to enforce their rights as shareholders in the articles, under [s 33 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/33). These types of claims are not affected by the rule in [[Foss v Harbottle [1843] ]] or the statutory procedure in CA 2006 ([[Lee v Sheard [1956] 1 QB 192, CA]]).

### Personal Claims for Reflective Loss

Where the alleged wrong results in a loss to the company as well as the shareholder, and the **only** loss alleged to have been suffered by the shareholder is in fact a reflection of the loss sustained by the company, the court will **not** allow the shareholder to bring a personal claim. This is a result of the rule in [[Foss v Harbottle [1843] ]].

In [[Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Newman Industries Ltd (No 2) [1982] Ch 204]], the principle was summarised as

> What [a shareholder] cannot do is to recover damages merely because the company in which he is interested has suffered damage. He cannot recover a sum equal to the diminution in the market value of his shares, or equal to the likely diminution in dividend, because such a “loss” is merely a reflection of the loss suffered by the company. The shareholder does not suffer any personal loss. His only “loss” is through the company, in the diminution of the net assets of the company.

### Personal Claims Involving Reflective Loss and Further Personal Loss

Suppose a shareholder can establish that a defendant's conduct constituted a breach of a legal duty owed to them personally, and that this caused them personal loss, separate and distinct to that of the company. Then they will be permitted to bring a personal action.

In [[Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1 HL]] Lord Bingham summarised this as three propositions:

>(1) Where a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty owed to it, only the company may sue in respect of that loss. No action lies at the suit of a shareholder suing in that capacity and no other to make good a diminution in the value of the shareholder's shareholding, where that merely reflects the loss suffered by the company. A claim will not lie by a shareholder to make good a loss which would be made good if the company's assets were replenished through action against the party responsible for the loss, even if the company, acting through its constitutional organs, has declined or failed to make good that loss…

>

>(2) Where a **company suffers loss but has no cause of action** to sue to recover that loss, the shareholder in the company may sue in respect of it (if the shareholder has a cause of action to do so), even though the loss is a diminution in the value of the shareholding…

>

>(3) Where a company suffers loss caused by a breach of duty to it, and a shareholder suffers a loss **separate and distinct** from that suffered by the company caused by breach of a duty independently owed to the shareholder, each may sue to recover the loss caused to it by breach of the duty owed to it but neither may recover loss caused to the other by breach of the duty owed to that other.

[[Giles v Rhind [2003] 2 WLR 237]]: high damages awarded to claimant for loss in value of shareholding, where defendant's wrongdoing disabled the company from suing him for damages.

### Statutory Minority Shareholder Rights

See [[Unfair Prejudice]] and [[Just and equitable winding up]]. There are also provisions in CA 2006 giving rights to minority shareholders in respect of particular decisions taken by the company:

Section | Right
---|---
[s 21 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/21) | Protection against alteration to the company's constitution, since a special resolution is needed to make alterations to the company's articles. Where shareholders are voting on a decision to amend the articles, the court will look at whether reasonable shareholders could have considered that the amendment was for the benefit of the company. Shareholders must vote to amend the articles in good faith ([[Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa [1900] 1 Ch 656]]) and not undermine the substantive rights of minority shareholders. It is also possible to "entrench" certain provisions in the articles by providing that a higher majority is required to alter these provisions (s 22(1)). In addition, it is possible for the shareholders in a shareholders' agreement to agree how they will exercise their voting rights on a resolution to alter the articles, and this agreement is enforceable ([[Russell v Northern Bank Development Corpn [1992] 1 WLR 588 (House of Lords)]]).
[s 303-305 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/303) | The right to requisition a general meeting. This requisition can be brought by shareholders holding not less than 5% of the voting paid-up capital of the company. If the directors fail to convene a general meeting within 21 days of the requisition, or to hold the general meeting within 28 days after calling it (s 304), the shareholders may call the general meeting themselves (s 305).
[s 321 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/321) | The right to demand a poll vote. Voting at GM takes place on a show of hands, unless a poll vote is demanded. On a poll vote, each member has one vote per share held. s 231: a poll vote may be demanded by not less than 5 members having a right to vote, members holding $\geq 10\%$ of all voting rights that could be cast at the meeting, and members holding shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting on which the aggregate paid up sum equals $\geq 10\%$ of the total sum paid up on such shares.
[s 33 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/33) | The right to enforce the articles.
