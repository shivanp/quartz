# Shares

Gives voting rights in shareholder meetings.

## Different Classes of Shares

The most common type is an ordinary share – entitling its holder to vote at shareholder meetings and to receive a share of the profits and surplus assets of the company after wind-up.

But can be different classes of ordinary shares with different voting rights (or no voting rights at all). Can be preference shares – entitling the holder to a preferential right to dividend/ return of capital in the event of a winding up. Usually different class rights set out in company's articles. See [[Class rights]].

## Nominal Value

Shares in a limited company having a share capital must have fixed nominal value. This is the minimum subscription price for that share – representing a unit of ownership rather than the actual value of the share. Common nominal values for ordinary shares are 1p, 5p or £1.

A share may not be [[allotted]]/ issued by company at discount to nominal value. But can be issued at a premium. The market value of a share is typically much higher than its nominal value.

Total value of all shares called [[Issued share capital]]. Not always necessary for shareholders to pay full amount due for their shares immediately. Amount paid called the paid-up share capital, and the amount outstanding can be demanded at any time. Once demanded, the payment has been 'called'.

## Limited Liability

The total nominal value of shares held by a shareholder is equal to the total amount of that shareholder's liability to contribute to the assets of the company if it becomes insolvent. So if all the shareholder's shares are fully paid, will not have to contribute any further amount to the company on insolvency.

## Why Subscribe for Shares
