# Shareholder actions

The doctrine of separate legal personality means that the company can sue and be sued in its own name. Where the company has suffered loss, the company is the proper claimant. But companies are inanimate, and vested interests may prevent the board of directors from bringing an action. Can an individual member bring a claim in this situation, where the board refuses to do so?

Courts are reluctant to interfere with the internal management of companies, preferring to leave this to the judgment of directors, who are elected by a majority of members and assumed to have greater commercial experience than judges. In [[Carlen v Drury (1812) 1 Ves & B 154]], put as

>“This Court is not required on every Occasion to take the management of every Playhouse and Brewhouse in the Kingdom.”

Two types of shareholder actions:

1. [[Personal claims]]
2. [[Derivative claims]]
