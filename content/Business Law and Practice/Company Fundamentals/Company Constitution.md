# Company Constitution

```toc
```

## Importance

- Represents a special type of contract between the company, as a separate legal person, and the shareholders, and between the shareholders.
- Evidences the existence of the company, states current share capital, and sets out rules governing how the company is run.

## Definition

Constitution includes:

1. Articles of Association (s 17)
2. Certificate of incorporation (s 32)
3. Current statement of capital (s 32)
4. Copies of any court orders and enactments altering constitution (s 32)
5. Resolutions affecting constitution (ss 17 & 29)
6. Agreements involving shareholders affecting constitution (ss 17 & 29)

## Articles of Association

```ad-statute
title: s 18(1) CA 2006
A company must have articles of association prescribing regulations for the company.
```

| Aspect | Details |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope for varying CA 2006 | Articles can be used to exclude some but not all provisions in CA 2006. |
| Availability | Available for inspection at Companies House. |
| Layout | Contained in a single document and divided into consecutive numbered paragraphs (s 18(3)) |

### Unamended Model Articles

```ad-statute
title: s 20 CA 2006 - **Default** application of model articles
(1) On the formation of a limited company—
- (a) if articles are not registered, or
- (b) if articles are registered, in so far as they do not exclude or modify the relevant model articles,

the relevant model articles (so far as applicable) form part of the company's articles in the same manner and to the same extent as if articles in the form of those articles had been duly registered.

(2) The “relevant model articles” means the model articles prescribed for a company of that description as in force at the date on which the company is registered.
```

Model articles comprise a set of **minimum basic rules** on running the company. They keep regulation to a minimum.

### MA Index

| Article numbers | Subject |
|:--------------- |:-------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Defined terms and liability of members |
| 3-6 | Directors' powers and responsibilities |
| 7-16 | Decision-making by directors |
| 17-20 | Appointment of directors |
| 21-29 | Shares |
| 30-35 | Dividends and other distributions |
| 36 | Capitalisation of profits |
| 37-41 | Organisation of general meetings |
| 42-47 | Voting at general meetings |
| 48-51 | Administrative arrangements |
| 52-53 | Directors' indemnity and insurance |

When reading the model articles, always consider them in conjunction with definitions in art 1.

### Special Articles

```ad-defn
Any amendments to MA / other provisions in the Articles are known as 'special articles'.
```

Commonly included special articles:

| Article | Description |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directors' meetings | Make calling directors' meetings more formal (e.g., notice period) or limit directors' ability to take decisions by electronic means. |
| Directors' interests in transactions | Allow directors' to vote on matters when they have a personal interest. Useful in small companies. |
| Directors' conflicts of interest | s 175 allows a private company to permit directors to authorise a situation which would otherwise breach s 175. MA contains no such provision. |
| Number of directors | s 154: minimum is 1. This can be changed. |
| Absence of directors | MA does not give directors' power to appoint a replacement if they are away. |
| Company secretary | Can amend model articles to include power of secretary. But could also do this through directors' general powers. |
| Removal of pre-emption rights | s 561: existing shareholders are offered the chance to buy any shares before they are offered to outsiders. |

It is also possible to create completely bespoke Articles from scratch.

### Effect of Articles

```ad-statute
title: s 33 - Effect of company's constitution

(1) The provisions of a company's constitution bind the company and its members to the same extent as if there were covenants on the part of the company and of each member to observe those provisions.

(2) Money payable by a member to the company under its constitution is a debt due from him to the company. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland it is of the nature of an ordinary contract debt. 
```

The constitution of a company forms:

1. a contract between the company and each of its members, and
2. a contract between all the company's shareholders.

#### S 33 Contract

This creates contracts in circumstances when they would not otherwise exist under contract law.

There is a contractual relationship between shareholders:

![[s 33 contract A.png]]

and between a company and a new shareholder:

![[s 33 contract B.png]]

#### Nature of Contract

The s 33 contract is very different from a standard trading contract.

```ad-important
The contract allows for action to be taken only in so far as it deals with membership rights ([[Beattie v E and F Beattie [1938] Ch 708]]).
```

This includes:

- the right to vote,
- the right to attend general meetings, and
- the right to a dividend if one is declared.

Articles only create a contract between a company and the members **in their capacity as members**, and not in any special or personal capacity. They do not give rights to any person who is not a member ([[Eley v Positive Government Security Life Assurance Company (1876) 1 Ex D 88 (CA)]]).

So not:

- The right to be a director ([[Read v Astoria Garage (Streatham) Ltd [1952] Ch 637]])
- The right to be a solicitor (*Eley*)

Such rights will be dealt with in a **shareholders' agreement**.

#### Effect of Contract

The members are bound by the s 33 contract ([[Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep-Breeders’ Association [1915] 1 Ch 881 (Ch)]]).

A member may sue another on the contract created by the articles without joining the company as a party ([[Rayfield v Hands [1960] Ch 1 (Ch)]]). But this is the only case in which an action between shareholders was successful.

#### Additional Terms

Since the articles are a contract, it is possible for additional terms to be implied if necessary to give effect to the contract ([[Cream Holdings Ltd v Stuart Davenport [2011] EWCA Civ 1287]]).

## Amending Articles

### Procedures

#### Special Resolution

```ad-action
title: Procedure
1. Pass a **special resolution** to change the articles ([s 21 (1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/21))
2. Registrar of Companies sent a copy of the articles as amended $\leq 15$ days after articles amended (s 26(1)) and a copy of the special resolution itself (s 30(1))
```

```ad-note
Another reason s 33 contractual rights are different from normal contract rights; you can't amend a contract without unanimous consent of 100% of parties.
```

#### Ordinary Resolution Exceptions

Two exceptions, under which specific articles can be amended using merely an ordinary resolution:

1. Revoking, varying or renewing directors' authority to allot new shares in the company, if authority provided for in articles (s 551(8)).
2. Authorising directors to determine the T&Cs of share redemption (s 685(2))

#### Court Rectification

If necessary, the court can exceptionally rectify the articles ([[Folkes Group plc v Alexander [2002] 2 BCLC 254]]).

#### Restrictions

| Restriction | Authority |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| The shareholders cannot amend the articles so as to conflict with a mandatory provision of CA 2006 | [[Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa [1900] 1 Ch 656]] |
| A shareholder is not bound by any change in the company’s articles which forces that shareholder to buy more shares in the company, unless they expressly agree in writing to be so bound | s 25 CA 2006 |
| Shareholders can make a change to the articles only if it is ‘bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole’ | [[Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa [1900] 1 Ch 656]] |

##### Bona Fide Interest

- Whether a change is ‘bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole’ is a subjective matter for the company’s shareholders to decide ([[Citco Banking Corporation NV v Pussers [2007] UKPC 13]])
- Amendment to Articles is not valid if no reasonable man could consider it to be for the benefit of the company ([[Shuttleworth v Cox Bros Ltd [1927] 2 KB 9]])
- Usually involves situations where the intention was to discriminate against minority shareholders rather than benefit the company as a whole.

#### Entrenched Articles

[s 22 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/22) permits entrenchment of specific provisions, though this is rare in practice.

```ad-defn
An entrenched article contains extra procedures or conditions, which makes it harder to change than other articles.
```

##### Restrictions

These entrenched provisions can always be amended by agreement of all members, or by a court order ([s 22(3) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/22)).

Under s 22(2) CA 2006 (**yet to enter force**), the entrepreneurs forming a company will only be able to include entrenched rights in the articles either when the company is first set up, or with the agreement of all the shareholders once the company has been registered.

Currently, an entrenched article may be included by passing a s 21 special resolution.

##### Procedure

When dealing with entrenched articles, extra paperwork must be sent to Companies House.

| Scenario | Form to send |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Articles amended to include entrenched article | Form CC01 |
| Articles amended to remove entrenched article | Form CC01 |
| Articles already include entrenched article and **any** article altered | Form CC03 |

## Memorandum

Represents a snapshot of the company and its owners at the time the company is formed.

## CA 1985 Companies

Constitutional documents differ substantially from CA 2006 companies.

### Memorandum

CA 1985 Memorandum was far more important. Consisted of:

- Name
- Registered office
- Objects
- Shareholders' liability
- Authorised share capital.

From 01/10/2009, the five main clauses of the memorandums of companies automatically became provisions of their articles (CA 2006, s 28(1)).

#### Liability Clause

The shareholders’ liability clause of the old-style memorandum simply stated: ‘The liability of  
the members is limited.’ This is now automatically a provision in the articles due to s 28(1) of  
the CA 2006.

#### Objects Clause

All companies in existence before 1 October 2009 had an objects clause in their memorandum. This clause set out the purposes for which the company was formed and included a statement of what it was empowered to do. Historically, if a company acted outside of its objects set out in the objects clause then it was said to have acted ‘ultra vires’.

### Ultra Vires Doctrine

Doctrine referring to the situation where a body purports to act outside its power. Derives from public law: public bodies granted certain powers by Parliament, beyond which they cannot stray. Doctrine applied to registered companies to protect creditors and shareholders (e.g., [[Re German Date Coffee Co [1882] 20 Ch D 169]]).

#### Problems

But doctrine was problematic:

- Objects clause initially not permitted to be altered. Could only be altered in very limited circumstances until 1991, when CA 1985 amendments came through
- Made diversification difficult
- Doctrine of constructive notice meant that anyone dealing with a company was deemed to have knowledge of the contents of its objects clause, so would be unable to argue they did not know the company lacked capacity to enter into transaction. Doctrine applied to all publicly available documents.

Effect was super long objects clauses from 60s to 90s. Very general and broad objects clauses accepted ([[Bell Houses Ltd v City Wall Properties Ltd [1966] 2 QB 656]]). Post 1991 registered companies specified in the memorandum that the company was a 'general commercial company', giving it power to carry on any trade or business and had power to do all such things as were incidental or conducive thereto. But issues of ultra vires still came before the courts: [[Re Introductions Ltd v National Provincial Bank [1970] Ch 199]].

There were recommendations for reform in the law to protect third parties. After the UK joined the European Community, in 1973 the First European Community Company Law Harmonisation Directive removed the doctrine of constructive notice where it concerned the memorandum and articles. It also contained a saving provision for ultra vires transactions where the transaction was dealt with by directors, and a third party was acting in good faith.

#### Reform

CA 1985 introduced a reform that the memorandum could be altered by special resolution, letting companies change their objects clause (s 4), and allowed companies to have a general objects clause stating that the company was to carry on business as a 'general commercial company' (s 3A), allowing them to carry on any trade or business whatsoever.

CA 2006 brought further changes:

1. s 35 CA 1985 had removed the doctrine of constructive notice in relation to a company's memorandum and articles. This was enshrined in [s 39(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/39): 'The validity of an act done by a company shall not be called into question on the ground of lack of capacity by reason of anything in the company's constitution'
2. The requirement of an objects clause in the memorandum was completely removed. [s 31 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/31): the default position is now that all companies have unrestricted objects.

Many older companies still have an objects clause.

- These are treated as if they are a provision of the articles ([s 28(1) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/28)) and will continue to bind the company unless altered by special resolution.
- If the company adopts new articles, then this treats the objects clause as having been removed
- Any constitutional restrictions on a company's capacity have no bearing on [[Liability in tort and crime]].
- **s 39 CA 2006** effectively abolishes the ‘ultra vires’ doctrine with regard to third parties dealing with the company.
- **s 40(1)**: the powers of the directors to bind a company (e.g., by entering a contact) are deemed to be free of any limitation under the company’s constitution in favour of a person dealing with the company in good faith.

Note there are still some possible internal consequences if the company's objects are exceeded.

##### Injunction

- If the company intends to act in breach of its objects, there is a right for a shareholder to go to court to seek an injunction under s 40(4) to restrain the company from taking this action.
- If the act has already been done (say, the contract has been signed), the shareholder can only take action against the directors (CA 2006, s 40(5)) for breach of their duty to the company.
- Directors are obliged under the CA 2006 to act within their powers, which includes observing any restrictions in the constitution (CA 2006, s 171).

##### Directors' Liability

Any objects clause has, post-CA 2006, the effect of restricting the directors rather than the company. Since the restrictions are now part of the articles, they can be removed by special resolution (s 21).

#### Authorised Share Capital

A company in existence before 1 October 2009 had to have a clause in its memorandum  
stating its authorised share capital. Now abolished: companies must instead make statements of capital each time more shares are issued.

### Articles

The old equivalent of MA was Table A, which was more comprehensive. MA imposes a far lighter administrative burden. There is also a 'Table A 2007' in force from 2007 to 2009.

### Relevancy

Companies with Table A articles may continue to operate under these rules (s 19(4) CA 2006). But major changes have been made to company law by CA 2006 meaning many Table A articles will be redundant or impose an unnecessary administrative burden.

| Specify that a unanimous decision of directors can be made by any means (no formal meeting required) | MA 8                                                 | No                      |

Notice the deregulatory trend. Many companies adopted special articles amending Table A. CA 2006 came into force in stages until 01/10/09. An interim solution was 'Table A 2007', though this is adopted by very few companies.

## Document Requests

If a shareholder requests a company's constitutional documents, a company must send them (s 32). This should include:

- Articles
- Certificate of incorporation
- Statement of capital.
