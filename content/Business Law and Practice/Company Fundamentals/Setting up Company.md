# Setting up Company

## From Scratch

> [!statute] s 7: Method of forming company
> 
> (1) A company is formed under this Act by one or more persons—
> - (a) subscribing their names to a memorandum of association (see section 8), and
> - (b) complying with the requirements of this Act as to registration (see sections 9 to 13).
> 
> (2) A company may not be so formed for an unlawful purpose.

### Registration

The documents which must be prepared and delivered to the Registrar for a private company limited by shares are:

1. an application for registration as a company;
2. a memorandum of association for the company; and
3. possibly articles of association for the company.

If everything is in order, the Registrar for Companies will register the documents and issue a certificate of incorporation.

#### Electronic Registration

Can do this using:

1. Companies House software filing service; or
	- Enter details with a third party, who then generate the documentation and send it through to Companies House.
2. Companies House Web Incorporation Service
	- Register on the website and enter required information.

#### Paper Registration

Hard copies of the necessary documents and the fee must be sent to the Registrar of Companies at Companies House, either by post or in person.

Companies House is expected to be empowered to require companies to file all documents digitally in a new Act of Parliament.

Hard-copy application for registration known as Form IN01.

### Company Type

The application must state whether the company is private or public, limited or unlimited, and limited by shares or by guarantee.

> [!warning]
> THis registration process cannot be used to set up an LLP.

### Company Name

- Ask client for a few alternatives, since there are statutory restrictions
- Check index of company names to check availability of requested name.
	- Under the Company, Limited Liability Partnership and Business (Names and Trading Disclosures) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/17), the ‘same’ name includes not just an identical name but also names which would be essentially the same if simple elements were disregarded.
	- Limited exceptions for when the new company will form part of the same group of companies.
- Name ending
	- Must end in Limited or Ltd or Welsh equivalents.
- Prohibited names
	- A company may not use a name which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State for BEIS, would amount to a criminal offence or is offensive (CA 2006, s 53).
	- More rules on using punctuation in a company name exist.

#### Names Requiring Approval

Some names will require approval:

- Sensitive words or expressions
- Names suggesting a connection to the government or devolved governments.
- Names suggesting a profession may need prior approval from a body, e.g., from the General Dental Council, to include the word 'dental' in the company name.
- Request must be made in writing to SoS for BEIS or to the relevant body.

#### Challenging Name

After the company has been formed, the use of the name may still be challenged by third parties.

#### SoS for BEIS Powers

- The Secretary of State may direct a company to change its name after the company has been registered if it is the same as or too like a name already on the index of company names under s 67.
- Power to change the company name if misleading information was given for use of a particular name (s 75) or if the name gives a misleading impression of the nature of the company’s activities, likely to cause harm to the public (s 76).

#### S 69

Any person may make an application to the Company Names Tribunal (CNT) to change a company’s existing name if that company’s name is the same as one in which

- the applicant has goodwill (defined as reputation of any description), or
- is sufficiently similar that it would be likely to mislead by suggesting a connection.

#### Tort of Passing Off

A company may be liable for the tort of passing off if it uses a name which suggests that the company is carrying on someone else’s business.

#### Trade Mark

If a company name includes the name protected by a trademark then the holder of a trademark may bring a claim against the company for infringement of that trademark. To avoid this risk, it is prudent to carry out a search of the Trade Marks Register.

### Business Name

A company, once it has been registered, may choose to operate with a trading or business name which is different from its registered name.

#### Restrictions

There are similar restrictions on the use of business names as apply to the company name proper, although there is no need to register a business name. The restrictions may be found in ss 1192 to 1199 of the CA 2006, and in the Company, Limited Liability Partnership and Business (Names and Trading Disclosures) Regulations 2015.

## Registered Office

> [!statute] s 86
> A company must at all times have a registered office to which all communications and notices may be addressed. 

The registered office may be at any address, but it is usually either a place where the company carries on its business (e.g. offices or factory), or the address of its solicitors or accountants.

The address must be provided on the application (CA 2006, s 9(5)(a)), and must include the country in which the registered office is situated (CA 2006, s 9(2)(b)).

## Statement of Capital

The application for registration must include a statement of capital and initial shareholdings (s 9(4)(a)). This statement must comply with the requirements set out in s 10.

> [!statute] Statement of capital and initial shareholdings
> 
> (1) The statement of capital and initial shareholdings required to be delivered in the case of a company that is to have a share capital must comply with this section.
>

> - (b) the **aggregate nominal value** of those shares,
> - (ba) the aggregate **amount (if any) to be unpaid** on those shares (whether on account of their nominal value or by way of premium), and
> - (c) for each class of shares—
> 	- (i) prescribed particulars of the **rights** attached to the shares,
> 	- (ii) the **total number** of shares of that class, and

> - (b) the amount to be paid up and the amount (if any) to be unpaid on each share (whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium).
> 
> (5) Where a subscriber to the memorandum is to take shares of more than one class, the information required under subsection (4)(a) is required for each class.

s 8(1)(b): each subscriber to the memorandum must take at least one share in the company.

## Statement of Proposed Officers

Required by s 9(4)(c), with further requirements imposed by s 12.

### Directors

- In private companies, there must be at least one director (s 154(1)).
- Key information on the directors to be appointed must be included on the statement contained in Form IN01 (s 12(1)).
- For individuals this includes the director’s name, home address (unless exempt), an address for service of documents, country of residence, nationality, business occupation and date of birth (s 163).
- If a corporate director is to be appointed to the new company, a human director must also be appointed to the new company (s 155(1))
- Different information must be provided on the application form for a corporate director (s 164).
- In all cases the company must make a statement that the proposed director has consented to act as a director of the new company on Form IN01 (s 12(3)).

### Directors' Address

- The director must provide an address for service of legal documents in the application (ss 12(2)(a) and 163(1)(b)).
- If an address other than the director’s home address is chosen then the director’s home address must still be disclosed on the application (s 12(2)(a)), but it is not a part of the application which may be viewed by the public (s 242(1)).
- A director who originally provides their home address when incorporating the company can subsequently make an application to the Registrar under s 1088 of the CA 2006 and the Companies (Disclosure of Address) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/214) to remove it.
- A proposed director of a company may apply to the Registrar for further privacy by having their home address removed from credit reference agencies’ records under s 243 of the CA 2006 and the Companies (Disclosure of Address) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/214)

### Secretary

s 270(1): a Ltd is not required to appoint a company secretary.

If the client does decide to appoint a company secretary for the new company then,

- For an individual, the name and an address for service must be included in the statement of proposed officers on the application for registration (ss 12(1) and 277)

Unlike a private company, a public company must always have a company secretary (s 271).

The company must make a statement that a proposed company secretary has consented to act for the new company on the application for registration (s 12(3)).

## Statement of Compliance

Sections 9(1) and 13 require a statement of compliance:

> ‘I confirm that the requirements as to registration under the Companies Act 2006 have been complied with.’

Each subscriber to the memorandum (original shareholder) of the company must make the statement, or an agent (such as a solicitor) may make it on the subscriber’s behalf. The Registrar of Companies may accept this statement as sufficient evidence of compliance with the CA registration procedure (s 13(2)).

## Articles of Association

Every company must have a set of articles (s 18). s 9(5)(b) may require a copy of the articles to be included with the application for registration of the new company being formed.

See [[Articles of Association]].

### Model Articles

1. for a private company limited by shares;
2. for a private company limited by guarantee; and
3. for a public company.

### Amended MAs

> - (a) in the company's articles on formation, or

> - (b) by order of a court or other authority having power to alter the company's articles.
> 
> (4) Nothing in this section affects any power of a court or other authority to alter a company's articles.
