# Partnership Agreement

## Introduction

Default provisions for partnerships in the absence of an express agreement: s 24 PA 1890.

## Common Provisions

Sensible provisions to include in an express agreement:

- Commencement date for mutual rights and responsibilities
- Name of partnership! May be different from business/ trading name
- Financial inputs and possible future contributions
- Shares in profits/ losses
	- PA 1890 implies that profits and losses will be shared equally, irrespective of initial investments.
- Any partner salaries
- Interest on partners' capital contributions?
- Profit-sharing ratio, and what happens in the event of a loss
	- Are salaries and interest on capital still paid out?
- Drawings
	- Monthly limit on drawings for each partner
	- Maybe a periodic review of this
	- Especially important for a joint venture.
- Shares in changes in asset values
	- Asset revaluation/ sale implication for partners?
	- Partners often content to share increases/ decreases equally, which will be the effect of PA 1890.
	- The basis for division of increases/decreases is known as the **'asset-surplus sharing ratio'**.
- Agree place and nature of business. Once agreed, any change would need the unanimous consent of partners.
- Ownership of assets
	- Deciding what is a partnership asset and what belongs to partners individually.
	- Evidence saves disputes on this.
	- Note that even title deeds may not be conclusive since one partner may have legal title in their sole name whilst holding the asset on trust for all the partners beneficially.
		- Recall that company case.
	- See [[Don King Productions Inc v Warren (No 1) [2000] Ch 291]].

### Work Input

PA 1890 implies a term into a partnership agreement (in the absence of contrary), that all partners are entitled to take part in the management of the business, albeit without any obligation to do so.

Wilful neglect of the business may mean the other partners are entitled to be compensated for the extra work undertaken by them.

The agreement should set out the degree of commitment expected of each partner. This is usually expressed in general terms; e.g., a partner must “devote their whole time and attention to the business”. Also, possible to specify that such partners must not be involved in any other business whatsoever during the partnership. Qualifications then involve holiday, sickness etc.

Without an express term to such an effect it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to show that a partner’s pursuit of outside interests or lack of commitment involve a breach of the terms of the partnership. Neither the Act nor the common law imposes any obligation on partners to involve themselves in the affairs of the partnership. The fact that some partners devote all of their time and efforts to its success is no guarantee that the other partners will do so too. An express term dealing with this issue is essential.

### Roles

Each partner's role should be explicitly stated. Anything agreed is binding between the partners, and any partner who ignores such a restriction would be acting in breach of contract.

### Decision-making

Unless agreed to the contrary, all partnership decisions will be made on the basis of a simple majority, except decisions on changing the nature of the business or on introduction of a new partner, which require unanimity.

> [!note]
> Anything contained in the agreement is a term of the contract between the partners so cannot be altered without the consent of all parties to the contract. The consent could be built into the contract itself - the agreement might contain provision for altering its terms (e.g., with a majority vote).

In a joint venture between companies, a decision-making mechanism will need to be included in the agreement.

### Duration

#### Dissolution by Notice

If there is no provision in the agreement, the partnership can be dissolved at any time by any partner giving notice to the others. This is a **partnership at will**.

> [!tip]  
> A partnership cannot be a 'partnership at will' under s 26 if there is any limitation placed on a partners right to terinate the agreement by unilaterally giving notice ([[Moss v Elphick [1910] 1 KB 846]]).

The notice of dissolution can have immediate effect and need not even be in writing, unless the agreement was by deed. This can cause instability, so usually restrictions are put on partners' abilities to dissolve the partnership.

s 32 PA 1890 defines the basis on which partnerships of any type are to be dissolved, subject to alternative agreement between the partners.

#### Other Solutions

Possible provisions and effects:

- Any notice of dissolution must allow a minimum period before taking effect.
	- This give time to settle what should happen on the dissolution.
- Agree a duration of fixed term of a number of years.
	- This provides certainty, but is inflexible in committing each partner to the partnership for a certain duration.
- The partnership is to continue for as long as there are at least two remaining partners, despite the departure of any partner by reason of retirement, expulsion, death or bankruptcy
	- Flexible, allows partners to leave
	- Provides stability
	- Can include ancillary provisions such as delaying payment to the outgoing partner, to mitigate financial problems of buying out a departing partner's share.

#### Death or Bankruptcy

> [!statute] s 33 PA 1890
> Unless there is contrary agreement, the death or bankruptcy of a partner will automatically cause dissolution of the entire partnership. 

Sensible to add a provision saying if other partners buy out, the partnership will continue. In a joint venture between companies, the agreement will need a mechanism for unwinding if one party becomes insolvent.

#### Court Order

> [!statute] s 35 PA 1890
> On certain grounds, the court can make an order for dissolution. This allows the partner to break their agreement with the other partners without being liable for breach of contract.

#### Retirement

PA 1890 provides for retirement, but only for a partnership at will, by dissolving the partnership under s 26.

Usually desirable to have express provision governing the question of when a partner can retire and payment for the departing partner's share by the others.

#### Expulsion

Amounts to terminating the contract with the outgoing partner without their consent. It is an important sanction for breach of agreement or other stipulated forms of misconduct.

Agreement should state grounds on which right is exercisable and how it will be exercised.

#### Payment for Outgoing Partner's Share

When a person ceases to be a partner because of retirement, expulsion, death or bankruptcy and the others continue, the will need to pay for the outgoing partner's share in the business. The agreement should contain appropriate terms (to avoid having to negotiate this every time).

If the agreement is silent and settlement cannot be reached:

> [!statute] s 42 PA 1890
> If a person ceases to be a partner and others continue in the partnership, but there is a delay in final payment of the former partner's share, the former partner/ their estate is entitled to receive either:
> - Interest at 5% on the aount of their share, or
> - Such share of the profits as is attributable to the use of the outgoing partner's share.

Provisions drafted here should include:

- Whether partners have a binding obligation to purchase the outgoing partner's share
- Basis on which the outgoing partner's share will be valued
- Provision for a professional valuation if agreement cannot be reached
- Date on which payment due
- Indemnity for firm liabilities.

#### Restraint of Trade After Departure

##### Competition

There should always be a provision limiting an outgoing partner's freedom to compete with the firm to protect the business connections of the continuing firm and to protect its confidential information. Drafting critical: unreasonable clauses will be held void. Must aim to protect the purchaser of a business, rather than to restrict the activities of the departing partner.

In [[Bridge and Deacons]] it was held that restraint of trade clauses must only protect a legitimate interest, such as a business and its goodwill, a share of which has been acquired from the partner being restrained. Secondly, they must do no more is than is necessary to protect that interest.

> [!defn] Non-competition clause
> A commonly used clause prevents a person from being involved in any way in a competing business. 

##### Other Forms of Restraint

- A 'non-dealing clause' seeks to prevent the former partner from entering into contracts with customers or former customers or employees of the partnership which they have left.
- A 'non-solicitation clause' merely seeks to prevent them from soliciting contracts from such customers or employees.

#### Arbitration

To avoid expense, delay and adverse publicity, the agreement may provide that certain disputes be resolved by arbitration.

#### Sharing Between Partners

> [!statute] s 24 PA 1890
> The interests of partners in the partnership property and their rights and duties in relation to the partnership shall be determined, subject to any agreement express or implied between the partners, by the following rules:—
> 
> (1) All the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the business, and must contribute equally towards the losses whether of capital or otherwise sustained by the firm.
> 
> (2) The firm must indemnify every partner in respect of payments made and personal liabilities incurred by him—
> 
> - (a) In the ordinary and proper conduct of the business of the firm; or,
> 
> - (b) In or about anything necessarily done for the preservation of the business or property of the firm.
> 
> (3) A partner making, for the purpose of the partnership, any actual payment or advance beyond the amount of capital which he has agreed to subscribe, is entitled to interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum from the date of the payment or advance.
> 
> (4) A partner is not entitled, before the ascertainment of profits, to interest on the capital subscribed by him.
> 
> (5) Every partner may take part in the management of the partnership business.
> 
> (6) No partner shall be entitled to remuneration for acting in the partnership business.
> 
> (7) No person may be introduced as a partner without the consent of all existing partners.
> 
> (8) Any difference arising as to ordinary matters connected with the partnership business may be decided by a majority of the partners, but no change may be made in the nature of the partnership business without the consent of all existing partners.
> 
> (9) The partnership books are to be kept at the place of business of the partnership (or the principal place, if there is more than one), and every partner may, when he thinks fit, have access to and inspect and copy any of them.

Generally, the Act aims for equality between partners. That is not always wanted, and sometimes more sophisticated rights and duties are more appropriate to a particular partnership. As a result, the terms implied by the Partnership Act are often overridden.

When drafting a partnership agreement, remember that lay-people will also be reading it, so make it more of a manual of rules rather than just being efficiency and only introducing terms which contradict PA 1890.
