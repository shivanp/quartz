# Debt Financing

Since private companies are unable to offer shares to the public ([s 755 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/755)), many instead raise finance through debt finance.

Most companies have unrestricted power to borrow, but a company's articles must be checked for restrictions.

Debt finance can broadly be categorised as either:

- Loan facilities
- Debt securities

```ad-note
Debt finance is primarily governed by contract law, rather than CA 2006. This means it can be more flexible than equity finance. 
```

## Authority

### Company Authority

- A company formed under the CA 2006 has unrestricted objects unless specifically restricted by the company’s articles of association (s 31(1)).
- MA do not place any restriction on borrowing.
- A company will therefore have an implied power to borrow money, unless expressly excluded by placing a restriction in the company’s articles ([[General Auction Estate and Monetary Co v Smith [1891] 3 Ch 432]]).

If there are any restrictions, amend the articles by special resolution.

A private company is able to borrow money from the moment its certificate of incorporation is issued. A private company which converts into a public company must, under s 761, first obtain its trading certificate.

### Directors' Authority

Directors must have authority to borrow money on behalf of the company. Stems from general authority (MA 3/ Table A art 70), but check any bespoke articles.

## Loan Facilities

> A loan facility is an agreement between a borrower and a lender which gives the borrower the right to borrow money on the terms set out in the agreement.

These include:

Loan facility | Description
---|---
Overdraft | On-demand facility, meaning the bank can call for all the money owed to it at any point in time and demand it is paid immediately. This is therefore unsuitable as a long-term borrowing facility.
Term loan | Loan of money for a fixed period of time, repayable on a certain date. Early repayment cannot be demanded unless the borrower breaches the agreement, and the lender will receive interest.
Revolving credit facility | Borrower has flexibility to borrow and repay. The borrower has flexibility to choose when it borrows and repays against a maximum aggregate amount of capital provided by the lender.

In each case, the agreement between the borrowing company and the lender is governed by contract law as clarified by the common law.

### Overdraft

- A form of temporary loan used to cover everyday business expenses when there is no other source of money available.
- If an overdraft has not been agreed in advance, the bank is not bound to meet any withdrawal not covered by funds in the account.
	- A company attempting to withdraw money in excess of the funds in its account may be regarded as making an **offer**, which the bank **accepts** by meeting the drawing = **contract**!
- “Uncommitted facility”, i.e., payable on demand.
	- ‘On demand’ means that the borrower is given enough time to effect the mechanics of payment, but not enough time to go and raise the money ([[Bank of Baroda v Panessar [1986] 3 All ER 751]]).
- Usually a fee is paid, and compound interest is charged on the overdrawn amount.
	- This practice will be implied in overdraft contracts unless the parties have agreed otherwise ([[Kitchen v HSBC Bank plc [2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 787]]).
- Can be relatively expensive, since borrowing is unsecured.

If security is taken over an existing overdraft account, the parties should be advised that money paid into an overdraft account (a credit) is treated as discharging the debt incurred first unless the parties have agreed otherwise – the rule in [[Clayton’s Case (1816) 1 Mer 529]] (i.e., first in, first out). Under IA ss 239 & 245, security may be held to be invalid if it is in respect of monies advanced to the borrower before the security was put in place.

### Term Loans

A company borrows a fixed amount of money for a specified period, at the end of which it must be repaid. Interest payable at regular intervals.

Term loans may be secured or unsecured (although they are usually secured), and they may be bilateral or syndicated.

The contract for a term loan may be called a ‘loan agreement’, or a ‘credit agreement’ or a ‘facility agreement’. The terms are used interchangeably.

A term loan may allow the borrowing company to draw down (i.e., take out) the loan all in one go, or to take it in instalments at, or by, agreed dates. The loan will usually be available to the borrower only for a short period (or periods if  
instalments are agreed) of time, known as the ‘availability period’, and it will not be available thereafter even if the company has not borrowed the full amount.

### Revolving Credit Facility

They are useful for companies whose income is not evenly distributed throughout the year. Interest is also payable at regular intervals.

Revolving credit facilities may be secured or unsecured (although they are usually secured), and they can be bilateral or syndicated. The contract for a revolving credit facility is usually called a ‘facility agreement’.

## Contractual Terms

### Payment to Borrower

Initial clauses of facility agreement will set out:

- Amount of loan
- Currency
- Type of loan
- Available periods.

Both a term loan and a revolving credit facility are ‘committed’ facilities.

```ad-defn
title: Committed facility
Once the loan agreement has been signed, the bank must provide the company with the loan monies when it requests them. A ‘commitment’ fee will be payable by the company.
```

In the unlikely event that the lender refused to lend in breach of the facility agreement, the company would be entitled to damages. If the company was able to obtain the same loan elsewhere then the damages would be nominal.

They may be regarded as damages for loss of expectation, to compensate the borrower for not being in the position that they should have been in ([[Robinson v Harman (1848) 1 Exch 850]]). Reasonableness is also considered in assessing damages.

### Repayment

The agreed payment schedule for the loan might provide for various repayment options:

| Repayment type    | Details                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bullet payment    | Repayment of the whole loan at the end of the term        |
| Amortisation      | Repayment in equal instalments over the term of the loan. |
| Balloon repayment | Repayment in unequal instalments, with the final instalment being the largest.                                                           |

Repayments for a revolving credit facility will be repaid at the end of each interest period, but can be reborrowed.

### Pre-payment

In a term loan, the company may in addition be granted an option in the facility agreement to repay earlier than the agreed repayment schedule. This is known as ‘pre-payment of the loan’.

It is usual to require that any prepayments are applied in reverse order to their maturity (the last scheduled repayment first).

### Interest Rates

A matter of agreement between the parties. There is no statutory control of the interest rate applicable to companies.

A floating rate commonly provides for the interest rate to be altered at specified intervals (e.g., every 3 months).

The interest rate consists of:

1. Mandatory costs to regulatory bodies
2. Interest rate at which banks borrow from one another (e.g., LIBOR)
3. Margin, which is the lender's profit.

#### Penalty Rate

```ad-defn
title: Default interest
An increased interest rate if scheduled payments are missed. 
```

Contract law allows the courts to strike down a provision which constitutes a penalty clause, as opposed to a clause for liquidated damages.

Default interest may not constitute a penalty, if the rate is such as only to compensate the lender for its additional funding costs and the increased credit risk of lending to a defaulting borrower ([[Jeancharm Ltd (t/a Beaver International) v Barnet Football Club Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 58]]).

```ad-action
Default interest clauses in a facility agreement must therefore be drafted very carefully, in accordance with current jurisprudence.
```

### Express Covenants

Commonly included covenants:

| Covenant                                    | Details                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Limitation of dividends                     | Dividends/ distributions must not exceed a specified percentage of net profits                          |
| Minimum capital requirements                | The company must ensure that current assets exceed current liabilities by a certain amount/ percentage. |
| No disposal of assets or change of business | Without lender's consent                                                                                |
| No further security over assets             | Without lender's consent. Called a 'negative pledge' clause                                             |
| Information on company's business           | Provide lender with annual accounts, interim financial statements etc.                                  |
| Limitation on future debt finance           | Company obliged to seek equity finance for new ventures.                                                                                                         |

These must be drafted carefully, to avoid the lender being found liable as a shadow director of the borrowing company. One way round this problem is for the lender in such a situation to make continuation of the loan conditional on certain steps being taken by the company. The company then has the choice of taking a new loan on those conditions, or looking elsewhere.

### Implied Covenants

Terms may be implied, e.g., bank's right to charge compound interest, implied by trade usage. The court’s power to imply terms is limited. A contractual term would be implied only if it were necessary to give efficacy to the contract ([[Thames Cruises Ltd v George Wheeler Launches Ltd [2003] EWHC 3093]]).

### Default

The facility agreement will contain ‘events of default’. If the company breaches any of these terms, the lender may terminate the agreement if it so wishes.

```ad-example
title: Events of default
- Failure to pay any sum due
- Commencement of insolvency procedure
- Breach of obligations under facility agreement 
- Cross-default (defaulting on a loan to another lender). 
```

## Debt Securities

> IOU: In return for finance provided by an investor, the company issues a security acknowledging the investor's rights. At the maturity date of the security, the company pays the value of the security back to the holder.

The classic example is a bond: the issuer promises to pay the value of the bond to the holder of that bond at maturity. Interest is also paid, usually bi-annually. Bonds are traded on the capital market(s). The holder of the bond at maturity will receive the value of the bond back from the issuer.

Private companies can only issue bonds to targeted investors, and not to the public indiscriminately (s 755 CA 2006 again).

| Debt Security    | Details                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commercial paper | Short-term debt securities which must be repaid ("matured") within 12 months of issue. Alternative to short-term borrowing. |
| Bonds            | Maturity of over a year. Usually admitted to LSE.                                                                           |
| EMTN programme   | Euro Medium-Term Note programme. More structured than offering individual bonds.                                            |

## Other Sources

There are other sources of debt finance.

| Source of debt finance | Details                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trade credit           | Where a company arranges to pay suppliers a number of days after invoices received. |
| Debt factoring         | Where a company sells its trade debts to a collection agency. The agency pays the company a proportion of debts assigned. The agency now owns the debts, and seeks to get as much back as possible from the debtors.                                                                                    |

## Debentures

Two meanings of debenture:

1. Under [s 738 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/738) debenture covers any form of debt security issued by a company, including debenture stock, bonds and any other securities of a company, whether or not constituting a charge on the assets of the company.
2. Also refers to the name of the particular documents which creates a security (usually used in this sense by lawyers). This is a separate document from the loan agreement, setting out the details of the security (as opposed to the terms of the loan)

## Secured Debt

A key method of protection is for a lender to take security over the assets of the borrowing company.

Unsecured debts are governed by the equality (*pari passu*) principle, which means that the unsecured debts are all reduced pro rata if there are insufficient funds to pay all the company’s debts. Security allows the lender to avoid this principle. For this reason, most borrowing by a company will involve the company giving security over its assets.

## Debt Vs Equity

### Return on Investment

#### Equity

- Dividends
	- Only paid when the company is sufficiently profitable.
	- Directors usually have cmoplete discretion, even when the company is profitable.
- Capital growth

#### Debt

- Interest

### Getting Money Back

#### Equity

- Solvent companies may be wound up, and in this case shareholders will receive back the full amount of their investment and potentially a fraction of the surplus capital.
- On the sale of shares. Private companies not permitted to offer shares to a public.
- If company buys back its own shares
- On a successful unfair prejudice claim, if the other shareholders buy out the claimant.

#### Debt

- As agreed between the parties in the loan agreement or in the terms of the bond
- Usually either in one bullet repayment on maturity or amortising through instalments
- On the sale of the debt: bonds usually tradeable by the investor before maturity. Loans can in some circumstances by sold by the lender.

A shareholder has no guaranteed income from their investment, whereas a lender does. Shareholder's capital is not repaid unless the company is wound up. But a lender will agree with the company a date for repayment of the capital sum loaned.

If a shareholder wishes to sell their shares in order to realise their capital investment in the company, the transfer of their shares is governed by the articles, and in a private company these usually restrict the shareholder’s choice (e.g., MA 26(5)).

### Priority on Winding up

#### Equity

Shareholders paid back after everyone else. In practice, highly unlikely to receive full value of their investment if the company is insolvent when winding up.

Arrangements may be made between shareholders as to priority between themselves (preference shareholders > ordinary shareholders).

#### Debt

- Creditors paid before shareholders
- Creditors can improve priority by taking security for the debt: secured creditors have priority over unsecured creditors. Fixed charge creditors take priority over floating creditors.
- Creditors may contractually agree to give priority to some lenders and subordinate others.

### Control

#### Equity

- Shareholders may have voting rights
- Existence and extent will depend on the rights granted upon the issue of shares
- Think about powers if you own >50% to do

#### Debt

- Lenders require the borrower to give undertakings: promises to do, or not do, certain things in the running of business (such as disposing of assets without the lender's consent)
- Security may also give the lender control over the assets which are subject to the security (e.g., like with a fixed charge)

### Tax Treatment

The payment of a dividend is not a deductible expense for the company. Payment of debenture interest, as it is incurred for the purposes of the trade, is a normal  
trading expense of the company, and so is deductible by it in computing trading profit before its corporation tax is assessed.

### Other Factors

#### Equity

- New shareholders must be found in order for a share issue to succeed

#### Debt

- Banks may not be willing to lend on attractive terms, or if the company is too highly geared. Gearing is the ratio of debt to equity.
- Existing loan agreements would need to be checked for undertakings which would prevent the borrower from borrowing more/ granting security
- Interest is a deductible expense for tax purposes, which makes debt more attractive.
- Involvement of investor
	- Shareholder has a degree of influence over how the company is run.
- Repayment of capital
	- Loan capital must be repaid at some date in the future, possibly on demand
- Cost
	- Cost of debt finance is the interest rate charged by the lender to the borrowing company.
	- Cost of equity finance are the likely returns to the new shareholder, including dividends, capital appreciation and share buybacks. These returns are the cost to existing shareholders.
- Existing restrictions
	- May be restrictions in the articles/ existing facilities agreements against the taking out of new loans or debt.
