# Taking Security

```toc
```

## Why Grant Security

> [!defn] Security
> Temporary ownership, possession, or other proprietary interest in an asset to ensure that a debt is repaid (i.e., collateral for a debt).

The main benefit of taking security is to protect the creditor in the event that the borrower enters into a formal insolvency procedure. It is possible to improve the priority of a debt by taking security for it. Enforcing the security can be a simpler way of obtaining repayment than suing the borrower.

Can benefit the company: the lender will usually allow the company to borrow money at a rate lower than would otherwise be the case.

## Initial Considerations

### Law

- Creation of security by a company is predominantly a matter of contract law.
- CA 2006 governs debentures and administration process of registering securities.
- See also IA 1986 and LPA 1925.

### Terminology

- CA 2006 uses 'charge' as an umbrella term
- LA 1925 uses 'mortgage' as the umbrella term
- IA 1986 uses 'security'.

### Company

- MA does not place any restriction on granting security
- So a company has an implied power to grant security for any borrowing
- Check the objects of pre-CA 2006 companies.
- Directors need necessary authority
	- MA 3/ Table A art 70.

### Lender

- Check there are no restrictions on the company granting security and the directors have the authority to act.
- Check for any existing charges at Companies House.
- s 859I: Registrar of Companies must include a certified copy of the instrument creating the charge in the register.
- If a charge over land is to be taken, check Land Registry for title and pre-existing charges.
- If a charge over IP rights is to be taken, check Intellectual Property Office.

## Types of Security

### Mortgages

Highest form of security.

The security provider retains possession of the asset, but transfers ownership to the creditor. Subject to the security provider's right to require the creditor to transfer the asset back to it when the debt is repaid. Right is known is the '[[equity of redemption]]'. The equity of redemption is held in reserve and only exercised if the borrowed money is not repaid.

A type of mortgage (known as “charge by way of legal mortgage” or “charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage”–s 87 LPA 1925) is usually taken over land. Ownership will remain vested in the security provider in this case.

### Charges

A form of security which does not transfer legal ownership from the chargor (company) to the chargee (lender).

Rather than transferring ownership, this involves the creation of an equitable proprietary interest in the asset, in favour of the creditor.

As well as the equitable proprietary interest, the charging document will give the lender certain contractual rights over the asset. These often include the right to appoint a receiver/ administrator to take possession of the house and sell it, if the debt is not paid back. Two types of charge: fixed and floating charges.

Type of charge | Description
---|---
Fixed charge | Prevents the borrower from dealing with the assets subject to the charge. This is the strongest form of security.
Floating charge | 'Floats' over a class of assets. It does not prevent the borrower from dealing with these assets, unless and until the floating charge 'crystallises'. This usually happens when the borrower defaults on the loan repayments.

The label applied to a charge is not always determinative, necessary to look at the terms of the charge itself ([[Agnew v IRC [2001] 2 BCLC 188, PC]]).

### Fixed Charge

Where a fixed charge is granted, the lender will control the borrower's use of the charged asset.

- The company cannot deal with the assets subject to the charge without the consent of the lender.
- A separate fixed charge must be created over each asset.
- The charge holder will require the company to keep the asset in good condition.
- If the charge becomes enforceable, the lender has the ability to appoint a receiver, and exercise a power of sale over the asset.

The creditor will usually prefer this, but it is not always appropriate. For instance, a fixed charge will not be applicable for stock/ raw materials which the borrower will need to use daily in the course of business. More likely to be taken over assets like plant and machinery.

The prevention of the chargor from freely disposing of the asset is crucial to the creation of a fixed charge ([[Ashborder BV v Green Gas Power Ltd [2004] ]]).

### Floating Charges

Most companies are unable to grant fixed charges for the majority of their assets.

With a floating charge, whatever assets in a particular class that a borrower owns at any point in time are subject to the floating charge.

> [!defn]
> In [[Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association [1904] AC 355]], a floating charge was defined as
> 
> - A class of assets, present and future; and
> - Which in the ordinary course of the company's business changes from time to time; and
> - It is contemplated that until the holders of the charge take steps to enforce it, the company may carry on business in the ordinary way as far as concerns the assets charged.

Possible to create more than one floating charge over the same group of assets. The asset are usually identified generically (e.g., “stock”).

#### Crystallisation

When a floating charge crystallises, it ceases to float over all the assets in a class and instead fixes onto the assets in the class charged at the time of crystallisation. The lender then has control of these assets, and the borrower is unable to deal with them, as if the assets were subject to a fixed charge.

However, the assets subject to crystallisation of the floating charge are **not** treated as fixed charge assets for distribution purposes on a winding up.

If the company receives more assets of the same class after crystallisation, these are automatically subject to the crystallisation charge ([[NW Robbie and Co v Whitney Warehouse Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 1324, CA]]).

The triggering events for crystallisation are set out in contract.

Crystallisation occurs:

1. In common law, on a winding up, appointment of a receiver or cessation of business
2. Specified event—as defined in the loan agreement. This usually occurs where a borrower defaults on the loan repayments or interest payments, or where another lender enforces their security.

- Advantages
	- Allows the company to deal with the secured assets on a day-to-day basis.
	- Allows the company to maximise the amount they are able to borrow.
	- Charge may be granted over the whole of the company's business.
- Disadvantages
	- A fixed charge will generally take priority over a floating charge over the same assets.
	- Company could sell existing stock and not purchase new stock to replace it, if there is just a floating charge over stock.
	- Preferential creditors also take priority over the holder of a floating charge (e.g., employees, pension payments ([[Bloom and others v Pensions Regulator (Nortel, Re) [2010] EWHC 3010 (Ch)]]), ring-fenced amount for the unsecured creditors).
	- Under s 245 IA 1986, in certain circumstances a floating charge is automatically void and a liquidator/ administrator can set it aside (basically if created at the 'relevant time' where it was obvious the company would fail).
		- In Re Comet Group Limited, the judge described its purpose as “to prevent a company that is on its last legs from creating a floating charge to secure past debts or to secure moneys which do not go to swell its assets and become available for creditors”.

### Book Debts

Book debt is an unpaid invoice, i.e., a sum owed to the company in respect of goods or services supplied by it.

Book debts are a fluctuating asset, and may be a significant asset of the company.

In early cases, the courts took the approach that a charge granted over book debts was a fixed charge, but this approach has now been overruled.

Case | Authority
---|---
[[Siebe Gorman and Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142]] | The court held that a charge over book debts was a fixed charge because of the degree of control of the bank which could stop the company making withdrawals, even when the account was in credit. Since overruled.
[[Re Brightlife Ltd [1987] Ch 200 ChD]] | The court in this case clarified that a company's bank balance is not a book debt and therefore cannot be subject to a fixed charge.
[[Re Keenan Bros Ltd [1986] BCLC 242]] | A fixed charge was created by the means of a requirement that the funds collected by the company were to be paid into a blocked account. The prior written consent of the bank was required before any funds were allowed to be withdrawn from this account. Here the court said that the charge was a fixed charge due to the fact that the account was blocked.
[[Re Brumark Investments Ltd [2001] ]] | The company's freedom to collect and use the proceeds of the book debts as it wished without requiring the lender's consent was inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge. This was a Privy Council case, which means that it is persuasive but not binding.

Eventually, the position was resolved in [[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41]]. It is now very difficult to demonstrate the requisite level of control over book debts for a fixed charge. It would require at least a blocked account.

> [!important] Charge over book debts
> 
> From the case of [[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41]] it is only possible to have a fixed charge over book debts if they are paid into a blocked account which gives the lender the degree of control required.
> 
> **Book debts can only be secured by a fixed charge where the charge holder has control over both the debts and the proceedds once they were paid.**

The court will look at the substance of an arrangement, not the title.

### Guarantee

Guarantees are not securities strictly, since they do not give rise to assets. But their commercial effect is similar to security.

A guarantee for a loan means an agreement that the guarantor will pay the borrower's debt if the borrower fails to do so.

Common for a director-shareholder to be compelled to give such a personal guarantee to secure a bank loan.

### Pledge

Where an asset is physically delivered to serve as security until the debtor has paid their debt. There is a right to sell the asset to settle the debt owed, upon the giving of reasonable notice.

### Lien

The right to physical possession of the debtor's goods until the debt is paid. But no right to sell these assets to settle the debt owed.

### Retention of Title

Buyer only gets title to goods upon paying the full price.

## Charging Document

| Term                           | Details                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Security                       | Fixed/ floating                                       |
| Representations and warranties | Contractual statements made by the borrowing company. |
| Covenants                      | Contractual promises made by the borrowing company.   |
| Enforcement and powers         | Circumstances in which security becomes enforceable, lender's powers (including power to sell assets to recover debt due), power to appoint an administrator (if [[Qualifying Floating Charge]] holder).                                                       |

## Issuing Debenture Procedure

- Usually directors decide whether to borrow money (MA 3)
- But might be voting/ quorum problems if directors asked to personally guarantee a loan.
- So may be necessary to call GM to suspend prohibitions in articles by OR, or change articles by SR.
- 2 directors/ director and a witness usually sign. Then affix company seal, if there is one.

## Registration

The registration regime changed on 06/04/13. It used to be compulsory to register most charges, now it is voluntary. But if the charge is not registered in time, there are consequences (e.g., may become void).

Guarantees don't need registering, mortgages and fixed/ floating charges usually do. For other stuff (loans, pledges), solicitors will usually register out of an abundance of caution.

### Procedure

Once agreement has been entered into, the company/ any person interested in the charge should deliver (s 859A(2)):

1. A s 859D statement of particulars to Companies House (s 859A(2))
	1. This will usually be Form MR01 for a company (or MR08 where there is no charge instrument) or the equivalent forms LLMR01 and LLMR08 for a limited liability partnership.
2. A certified copy of the instrument creating the charge (s 859A(3))
3. The requisite fee

Also:

- [s 859A(4) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859A) states that the charge must be registered within **21 days** beginning with **the day after the date of creation** of the charge. Any person interested in the charge may complete the registration formalities (usually done by the lender).
- If the charge is not registered within the 21-day period, under [s 859H(3) CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859H), the charge is void as against a liquidator, administrator, or creditor of the company and the debt becomes immediately payable. This means that the holder of the charge is reduced to an unsecured creditor. It is therefore crucial to register the security on time so that it is enforceable in priority to other creditors.
- Certified copies of all charges must be kept at the company’s registered office ([s 859P CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859P)) or SAIL (s 859Q).
	- Failure to do this is a criminal offence, but does not affect the charge in any way.

After documents have been delivered, the Registrar of Companies must register the charge (s 859A(2)). 12-digit reference code allocated. A copy of the charge will be put on the register (s 859I(3)). This is conclusive evidence that the charge has been properly registered (s 859I(6)).

### Other Registers

- If a fixed charge is taken over land, must be registered both at Companies House and at the Land Registry.
- Separate registers for charges over specialist assets.

### Failure to Register

> [!warning]
> Failure to register the charge renders the charge void against a liquidator or an administrator of the company, and also against the company’s other creditors (CA 2006, s 859H(3)).

So another creditor registering a charge over the same asset later will take priority. A liquidator/ administrator can ignore the charge completely when dividing up resources.

The security remains valid against the company itself, although the money secured by the charge becomes payable immediately (CA 2006, s 859H(4)).

### Late/ Inaccurate Delivery

Under [s 859F CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859F), the court has the power to extend the period for registration where the grounds of s 859F(2) are met:

>(a) that the failure to deliver those documents-  
>(i) was accidental or due to inadvertence or to some other sufficient cause, or  
>(ii) is not of a nature to prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders of the company, or  
>(b) that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief.

The court will allow the register to be rectified provided this does not prejudice any other charges created between the date of creation of the unregistered charge and the date of eventual registration ([[Barclays Bank plc v Stuart Landon Ltd [2001] 2 BCLC 316]]).

If an application is successful, the charge will have priority only from the date of actual registration, so may lose priority due to the delay if other charges have been registered in the meantime.

The court has also refused to allow a charge to be registered late, where the time elapsed is too long ([[Victoria Housing Estates Ltd v Ashpurton Estates Ltd [1982]]]).

The court has power:

- Under s 859M to allow rectification of a statement/ notice delivered to the Registrar for inaccurate details.
- Under s 859N if the charging document was defective/ wrong document was sent, can be replaced.

### Redemption of Loan

When the loan secured by a registered charge is repaid by the company to the lender, a person with an interest in the registration of the charge (such as a director of the company) may, but is not obliged to, complete, sign and send **Form MR04** to the Registrar of Companies at Companies House. This is usually done to ensure the company's file is up-to-date.

### Release of charge/ Sale of Property

If, instead of the loan being paid off, the lender decides to release the company’s property from the charge or allows the company to sell the asset covered by the charge, a person with an interest in the registration of the charge (such as a director of the company) must complete, sign and send **Form MR05** to the Registrar of Companies at Companies House.

## Priority of Charges

Provided the charges are all registered properly under s 859A of the CA 2006:

- A fixed charge or mortgage will take priority over a floating charge over the same asset, even if the floating charge was created before the fixed charge or mortgage.
- If there is more than one fixed charge and mortgage over the same asset, they have priority in order of their date of creation (and not their date of registration).
- If there is more than one floating charge over the same asset, they have priority in order of their date of creation (and not their date of registration).

See [[Statutory order of priority on winding up]].

### Subordination

It is possible for creditors to enter into an agreement between themselves to alter the order of priority of the charges, in a "deed of priority".

### Negative Pledge

It is usual to create a 'negative pledge' clause, prohibiting the company from creating later charges with priority to a floating charge, without the floating charge holder's permission. If a subsequent lender takes a charge over the same asset and has actual knowledge of the negative pledge clause, then the subsequent lender will be subordinate to the original charge holder ([[English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Company Ltd v Brunton [1892] 2 QB 700]]).

The existence of a negative pledge clause is identified by completing a section of Form MR01 sent to Companies House, and the clause itself will be included in the certified copy of the charging document which is delivered to the Registrar.

> [!action]
> The agreement for the subsequent charge should contain a covenant (contractual promise) by the company to the effect that there are no earlier charges which are subject to a negative pledge clause. If this is not true, the company will be in breach of that agreement and it may be terminated immediately.
