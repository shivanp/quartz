\section{Debt Financing}\label{debt-financing}}

Since private companies are unable to offer shares to the public
(\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/755}{s 755
CA 2006}), many instead raise finance through debt finance.

Most companies have unrestricted power to borrow, but a company's
articles must be checked for restrictions.

Debt finance can broadly be categorised as either:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Loan facilities
\item
  Debt securities
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Debt finance is primarily governed by contract law, rather than CA 2006. This means it can be more flexible than equity finance. }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{authority}{%
\subsection{Authority}\label{authority}}

\hypertarget{company-authority}{%
\subsubsection{Company Authority}\label{company-authority}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A company formed under the CA 2006 has unrestricted objects unless
  specifically restricted by the company's articles of association (s
  31(1)).
\item
  MA do not place any restriction on borrowing.
\item
  A company will therefore have an implied power to borrow money, unless
  expressly excluded by placing a restriction in the company's articles
  ({[}{[}General Auction Estate and Monetary Co v Smith {[}1891{]} 3 Ch
  432{]}{]}).
\end{itemize}

If there are any restrictions, amend the articles by special resolution.

A private company is able to borrow money from the moment its
certificate of incorporation is issued. A private company which converts
into a public company must, under s 761, first obtain its trading
certificate.

\hypertarget{directors-authority}{%
\subsubsection{Directors' Authority}\label{directors-authority}}

Directors must have authority to borrow money on behalf of the company.
Stems from general authority (MA 3/ Table A art 70), but check any
bespoke articles.

\hypertarget{loan-facilities}{%
\subsection{Loan Facilities}\label{loan-facilities}}

\begin{quote}
A loan facility is an agreement between a borrower and a lender which
gives the borrower the right to borrow money on the terms set out in the
agreement.
\end{quote}

These include:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.5000}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.5000}}@{}}
\toprule()
\begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
Loan facility
\end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}[b]{\linewidth}\raggedright
Description
\end{minipage} \\
\midrule()
\endhead
Overdraft & On-demand facility, meaning the bank can call for all the
money owed to it at any point in time and demand it is paid immediately.
This is therefore unsuitable as a long-term borrowing facility. \\
Term loan & Loan of money for a fixed period of time, repayable on a
certain date. Early repayment cannot be demanded unless the borrower
breaches the agreement, and the lender will receive interest. \\
Revolving credit facility & Borrower has flexibility to borrow and
repay. The borrower has flexibility to choose when it borrows and repays
against a maximum aggregate amount of capital provided by the lender. \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

In each case, the agreement between the borrowing company and the lender
is governed by contract law as clarified by the common law.

\hypertarget{overdraft}{%
\subsubsection{Overdraft}\label{overdraft}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A form of temporary loan used to cover everyday business expenses when
  there is no other source of money available.
\item
  If an overdraft has not been agreed in advance, the bank is not bound
  to meet any withdrawal not covered by funds in the account.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A company attempting to withdraw money in excess of the funds in its
    account may be regarded as making an \textbf{offer}, which the bank
    \textbf{accepts} by meeting the drawing = \textbf{contract}!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ``Uncommitted facility'', i.e., payable on demand.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    `On demand' means that the borrower is given enough time to effect
    the mechanics of payment, but not enough time to go and raise the
    money ({[}{[}Bank of Baroda v Panessar {[}1986{]} 3 All ER
    751{]}{]}).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Usually a fee is paid, and compound interest is charged on the
  overdrawn amount.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This practice will be implied in overdraft contracts unless the
    parties have agreed otherwise ({[}{[}Kitchen v HSBC Bank plc
    {[}2000{]} 1 All ER (Comm) 787{]}{]}).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Can be relatively expensive, since borrowing is unsecured.
\end{itemize}

If security is taken over an existing overdraft account, the parties
should be advised that money paid into an overdraft account (a credit)
is treated as discharging the debt incurred first unless the parties
have agreed otherwise -- the rule in {[}{[}Clayton's Case (1816) 1 Mer
529{]}{]} (i.e., first in, first out). Under IA ss 239 \& 245, security
may be held to be invalid if it is in respect of monies advanced to the
borrower before the security was put in place.

\hypertarget{term-loans}{%
\subsubsection{Term Loans}\label{term-loans}}

A company borrows a fixed amount of money for a specified period, at the
end of which it must be repaid. Interest payable at regular intervals.

Term loans may be secured or unsecured (although they are usually
secured), and they may be bilateral or syndicated.

The contract for a term loan may be called a `loan agreement', or a
`credit agreement' or a `facility agreement'. The terms are used
interchangeably.

A term loan may allow the borrowing company to draw down (i.e., take
out) the loan all in one go, or to take it in instalments at, or by,
agreed dates. The loan will usually be available to the borrower only
for a short period (or periods if\\
instalments are agreed) of time, known as the `availability period', and
it will not be available thereafter even if the company has not borrowed
the full amount.

\hypertarget{revolving-credit-facility}{%
\subsubsection{Revolving Credit
Facility}\label{revolving-credit-facility}}

They are useful for companies whose income is not evenly distributed
throughout the year. Interest is also payable at regular intervals.

Revolving credit facilities may be secured or unsecured (although they
are usually secured), and they can be bilateral or syndicated. The
contract for a revolving credit facility is usually called a `facility
agreement'.

\hypertarget{contractual-terms}{%
\subsection{Contractual Terms}\label{contractual-terms}}

\hypertarget{payment-to-borrower}{%
\subsubsection{Payment to Borrower}\label{payment-to-borrower}}

Initial clauses of facility agreement will set out:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Amount of loan
\item
  Currency
\item
  Type of loan
\item
  Available periods.
\end{itemize}

Both a term loan and a revolving credit facility are `committed'
facilities.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{title: Committed facility}
\NormalTok{Once the loan agreement has been signed, the bank must provide the company with the loan monies when it requests them. A ‘commitment’ fee will be payable by the company.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the unlikely event that the lender refused to lend in breach of the
facility agreement, the company would be entitled to damages. If the
company was able to obtain the same loan elsewhere then the damages
would be nominal.

They may be regarded as damages for loss of expectation, to compensate
the borrower for not being in the position that they should have been in
({[}{[}Robinson v Harman (1848) 1 Exch 850{]}{]}). Reasonableness is
also considered in assessing damages.

Repayments for a revolving credit facility will be repaid at the end of
each interest period, but can be reborrowed.

\hypertarget{pre-payment}{%
\subsubsection{Pre-payment}\label{pre-payment}}

In a term loan, the company may in addition be granted an option in the
facility agreement to repay earlier than the agreed repayment schedule.
This is known as `pre-payment of the loan'.

It is usual to require that any prepayments are applied in reverse order
to their maturity (the last scheduled repayment first).

\hypertarget{interest-rates}{%
\subsubsection{Interest Rates}\label{interest-rates}}

A matter of agreement between the parties. There is no statutory control
of the interest rate applicable to companies.

A floating rate commonly provides for the interest rate to be altered at
specified intervals (e.g., every 3 months).

The interest rate consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Mandatory costs to regulatory bodies
\item
  Interest rate at which banks borrow from one another (e.g., LIBOR)

Contract law allows the courts to strike down a provision which
constitutes a penalty clause, as opposed to a clause for liquidated
damages.

Default interest may not constitute a penalty, if the rate is such as
only to compensate the lender for its additional funding costs and the
increased credit risk of lending to a defaulting borrower
({[}{[}Jeancharm Ltd (t/a Beaver International) v Barnet Football Club

These must be drafted carefully, to avoid the lender being found liable
as a shadow director of the borrowing company. One way round this
problem is for the lender in such a situation to make continuation of
the loan conditional on certain steps being taken by the company. The
company then has the choice of taking a new loan on those conditions, or
looking elsewhere.

The classic example is a bond: the issuer promises to pay the value of
the bond to the holder of that bond at maturity. Interest is also paid,
usually bi-annually. Bonds are traded on the capital market(s). The
holder of the bond at maturity will receive the value of the bond back
from the issuer.

Private companies can only issue bonds to targeted investors, and not to
the public indiscriminately (s 755 CA 2006 again).

Two meanings of debenture:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Under
  \href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/738}{s 738
  CA 2006} debenture covers any form of debt security issued by a
  company, including debenture stock, bonds and any other securities of
  a company, whether or not constituting a charge on the assets of the
  company.
\item
  Also refers to the name of the particular documents which creates a
  security (usually used in this sense by lawyers). This is a separate
  document from the loan agreement, setting out the details of the
  security (as opposed to the terms of the loan)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{secured-debt}{%
\subsection{Secured Debt}\label{secured-debt}}

A key method of protection is for a lender to take security over the
assets of the borrowing company.

Unsecured debts are governed by the equality (\emph{pari passu})
principle, which means that the unsecured debts are all reduced pro rata
if there are insufficient funds to pay all the company's debts. Security
allows the lender to avoid this principle. For this reason, most
borrowing by a company will involve the company giving security over its
assets.

A shareholder has no guaranteed income from their investment, whereas a
lender does. Shareholder's capital is not repaid unless the company is
wound up. But a lender will agree with the company a date for repayment
of the capital sum loaned.

If a shareholder wishes to sell their shares in order to realise their
capital investment in the company, the transfer of their shares is
governed by the articles, and in a private company these usually
restrict the shareholder's choice (e.g., MA 26(5)).

\hypertarget{maintenance-of-share-capital}{%
\subsection{Maintenance of Share
Capital}\label{maintenance-of-share-capital}}

Key principle of company law. Capital must generally be maintained, as
it is the fund to which the \textbf{creditors} look for payment of debts
owed to them. In other words, paid-up share capital must not be returned
to its shareholders, and their liability in respect of capital not paid
up on shares must not be reduced.

The doctrine of capital maintenance states that the company must
maintain and not reduce its share capital except in certain very limited
circumstances. The share capital therefore is a permanent fund available
to creditors.

The doctrine was developed from {[}{[}Trevor v Whitworth (1887) 12 App
Cases 409{]}{]}, with the goal of protecting creditors. Creditor
perspective: the share capital of a company gives an indication of its
creditworthiness. Unsecured creditors will seek to claim payment from
the company's capital as well as its unsecured assets if the company is
wound up.

Capital can still be lost as a result of poor business decisions or
market conditions, but this is a legitimate risk to both shareholders
and creditors.

Many companies, large and small, have very limited share capital: so the
doctrine doesn't really protect creditors much in this case.

\begin{Shaded}

\hypertarget{impact-of-doctrine}{%
\subsubsection{Impact of Doctrine}\label{impact-of-doctrine}}

The doctrine has an impact on a number of transactions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The granting of dividends/ distributions
\item
  Reduction of share capital
\item
  Purchase and redemption of own shares
\end{itemize}

The doctrine of capital maintenance limits the funds from which the
company may pay dividends to its shareholders, since the payment of a
dividend will reduce the company's assets available to
\textbf{creditors}.

Consequences:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Company must not generally purchase its own shares (s 658 CA 2006)
\item
  Public company may not generally give {[}{[}Financial assistance{]}{]}
  to anyone for the purposes of buying company shares
\item
  Dividends may not be paid out of capital
\item
  In the case of a serious loss of capital, a GM must be called to
  discuss the problem
\item
  A subsidiary may not be a member of its own holding company.
\item
  Any allotment/ transfer of shares in a holding company to its
  subsidiary is void.
\end{itemize}

A company cannot generally reduce share capital by exchanging
shareholders' shares for valuable consideration.

Exceptions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reduce share capital with consent of court (ss 641-648)
\item

\hypertarget{issuing-shares}{%
\subsection{Issuing Shares}\label{issuing-shares}}

In return for issuing shares, the company will receive cash used for the

\item
  s 549: directors' need for authority to allot shares
\item
  ss 561 \& 565: statutory pre-emption rights.
\end{itemize}

Shares are allotted to someone (i.e., allocated) when that person has
the unconditional right for their name to be entered onto the company's
register of members (CA 2006, s 558). They may then be said to have been
issued by the company when the name of the shareholder has actually been
entered on the company's register of members.

Companies were required to have an `authorised share capital'; a ceiling

If such a provision exists (e.g., for a pre-CA 2006 company), the
articles may need to be amended. But the amendment is by ordinary
resolution.

\hypertarget{ca-2006}{%

A company is simply required to make a statement of capital and initial
shareholdings when the company was incorporated on Form IN01. A new
statement of capital must be submitted whenever more shares are issued.

Shareholder approval will not be required for a private company with
only one class of shares, under the simplified procedure (ss 549-551).

If a CA 2006 company has included a restriction on the number of shares
it can issue (super rare), it would have to amend articles by special
resolution to change this.

Directors of a private company automatically have authority to allot its
shares, provided the company has only one class of shares and there is
nothing to the contrary in the articles (s 550). If a pre-1 October 2009
company wishes to make use of the power given\\
under s 550, it has to pass an ordinary resolution of the shareholders
in order to do so.

\hypertarget{other-companies}{%
\paragraph{Other Companies}\label{other-companies}}

The directors can issue shares in the company only if they have
authority to do so. This authority must be given specifically, either in
the articles (by a special article), or by ordinary resolution of the
shareholders at a GM or by written resolution (CA 2006, ss 549--551).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{If an ordinary resolution is needed, it must be filed with the Registrar of Companies (s 551(9)). }

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Number of shares directors are authorised to allot
\item
  Time limit on authority (generally \(\leq 5\) years - s 551(3))
\end{itemize}

Authority may be revoked by ordinary resolution at any time

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is even if the authority was originally given by the articles
  (which would require a special resolution to amend).
\item
  Would require filing with Registrar of Companies (s 551(9))
\end{itemize}

Under s 555 of the CA 2006, a return of allotments must be filed with
Companies House within one month, as must a modified statement of
capital (s 555(3)). Both of these are contained on Form SH01.

\hypertarget{statutory-pre-emption-rights}{%
\subsubsection{Statutory Pre-emption

Shareholders have rights of first refusal when the company issues new
shares in most circumstances
(\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/561}{s 561
CA 2006}). This only applies where the shares to be issued are

that have capped participating rights as to both dividends and capital.

\hypertarget{exceptions-and-exclusions}{%

The right to pre-emption does not apply where the new shares to be

  Bonus shares;
\item
  Shares issued under an employee share scheme
\item
  Shares issued for non-cash consideration
  (\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/564}{s 564

A company may exclude the right of pre-emption by specific provision in
the articles
(\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/567}{s
567-568 CA 2006}). However, this is not common.

More commonly, the pre-emption rights are disapplied by a special
resolution of the shareholders:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Directors of a private limited company with only one class of shares
  may be given power by the articles or by a special resolution, to
  allot equity securities of that class as if s 561 (existing

  such modifications as the directors may determine
  (\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/569}{s 569
  CA 2006}).
\item
  Pre-emption rights may also be disapplied by special resolution under
  \href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/570}{s 570
  CA 2006} where the directors of the company are acting under a general
  authority
  (\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/551}{s 551
  CA 2006}) to issue shares. In this situation, pre-emption rights are
  disapplied for all shares issued in accordance with this general
  authority.
\item
  \href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/571}{s 571

\hypertarget{pre-emption-rights-on-transfer-of-shares}{%

Shares}\label{pre-emption-rights-on-transfer-of-shares}}

In general, there are no rights of pre-emption for existing shareholders
where shareholders transfer shares.

But a private company may provide for pre-emption rights on transfer of
shares in either the articles or a shareholder agreement. This is common
in small private companies.

But if the private company has a corporate shareholder, the transfer of
shares by this corporate shareholder will not trigger pre-emption rights
provisions ({[}{[}Re Coroin {[}2011{]} EWHC 3466{]}{]}).

resolution of the shareholders, or by a provision in the articles (not
included in MA). The advantage to this section is that the
disapplication may be indefinite.

==The label attached to a share is not determinative.== The rights
attached to a class of shares are determined in the company's articles.

\hypertarget{classes}{%
\subsubsection{Classes}\label{classes}}

Common types:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ordinary shares
\item
  Redeemable shares
\item
  Preference shares
\item
  Non-voting shares
\item
  Employees' shares
\item
  Cumulative shares
\item
  Convertible shares
\item
  Deferred shares
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ordinary-shares}{%
\paragraph{Ordinary Shares}\label{ordinary-shares}}

These are the default position and most common. Carry a right to vote in
general meetings, a right to receive a dividend if one is declared by
the directors, and a right to receive a share of the capital when a
company is wound up.

Defined in
\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/560}{s 560(1)
CA 2006} as

\begin{quote}
shares other than shares that as respects dividends and capital carry a
right to participate only up to a specified amount in a distribution.
\end{quote}

The negative definition illustrates that ordinary shares are the default
position and are shares that have an unlimited right to participate in
dividends and surplus capital when a company is wound up.

\hypertarget{preference-shares}{%
\paragraph{Preference Shares}\label{preference-shares}}

Shares usually entitled to have dividends paid at a predetermined rate,
in priority to any dividend paid on ordinary shares.

Dividends can only be paid where the company has distributable profits
and a dividend is declared.

Preference shares often have a right to priority over the ordinary
shareholders when capital is returned to the members in a winding up.
Rights of preference shareholders may be \textbf{cumulative} (arrears of
preference dividends not declared in earlier years must be paid before
ordinary shareholders are paid) or \textbf{non-cumulative} (only current
year's dividend payable).

May be \textbf{participating}, meaning shareholders can also participate
in a dividend or capital on a winding up alongside ordinary
shareholders. This means they receive both their fixed preferential
dividend or a fraction of capital, plus a fraction of the general
dividend/ capital in accordance with their shareholding.

\hypertarget{deferred-shares}{%
\paragraph{Deferred Shares}\label{deferred-shares}}

Shares normally only have a right to a dividend and/or return of capital
after the claims of the preference shareholders and ordinary
shareholders. Usually issued to the founders of a company, not very
common.

\hypertarget{redeemable-shares}{%
\paragraph{Redeemable Shares}\label{redeemable-shares}}

Temporary shares, which may be bought back by the company at a future
date. Governed by Chapter 3
\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/684}{s
684-689 CA 2006}.

\hypertarget{convertible-shares}{%
\paragraph{Convertible Shares}\label{convertible-shares}}

May be converted to a different type of share in the issuing company,
according to a pre-arranged formula set out in the articles.

\hypertarget{employees-shares}{%

Employees' share schemes can have tax advantages. Usually ordinary
shares with extra restrictions (e.g., on transfer).

\begin{Shaded}

\subsubsection{Variation of Class
Rights}\label{variation-of-class-rights}}

Baseline presumption: all shares have equal rights, unless there is an
express provision in the articles to the contrary ({[}{[}Birch v Cropper
(1889) 14 App Cas 525{]}{]})

\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/630}{s 630 CA
2006}: class rights can only be varied

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In accordance with the relevant provisions in the company's articles,
\item
  Or if there is no provision in the articles:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Where 75\% in value of the shares of the affected class consent in
    writing,
  \item
    Or a special resolution is passed at a separate meeting of the
    holders of the affected class of shares.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Companies can \textbf{entrench} class rights in their articles
(\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/22}{s 22 CA
2006}), and in this case the protection cannot be circumvented by
changing the rights attached to shares under s 630.

Shareholders voting at a class meeting to vary rights must vote with the
dominant purpose of benefitting the class as a whole, or the variation
may be invalid ({[}{[}British America Nickel Corpn Ltd v O'Brien
{[}1927{]} AC 369 (PC){]}{]}).

\hypertarget{exercise-of-rights}{%
\paragraph{Exercise of Rights}\label{exercise-of-rights}}

Statutory provisions under s 630 apply only if the shareholders have
``class rights'' which are to be varied. Variations affecting the
exercise of the rights, rather than the rights themselves, are not
subject to s 630.

Issuing more shares of a particular class doesn't count as `varying' the
class rights, even through it may dilute the amount of dividend
previously paid. The attitude is that the substantive legal rights of
the class have not been altered, only the way in which these rights have
been exercised.

\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/663}{s 633 CA
2006}: dissenting members of a class of shares have a right to challenge
a variation.

The conditions for this are:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Only shareholders holding \(\geq 15\%\) of the issued shares of that
  class may challenge a variation, and
\item
  The variation must be challenged in court within 21 days of the date
  on which consent was given, or the resolution was passed, to vary the
  class rights.
\end{enumerate}

Common law now indicates that a vote on a resolution to vary class
rights must be exercised for a purpose/ dominant purpose of benefitting
the class as a whole ({[}{[}British America Nickel Corpn Ltd v O'Brien
{[}1927{]} AC 369{]}{]}) so this may be grounds for a challenge.

Two different classes of ordinary shares may carry different voting and
dividend rights. In any one company, the rights attaching to a share are
dependent on the articles of that\\
company.

The different classes of shares and the rights attaching to them must be
included on the\\
statement of capital which is lodged at Companies House when the company
is formed (as part of Form IN01) and whenever the number of issued
shares changes.

\hypertarget{ordinary-shares-1}{%
\subsubsection{Ordinary Shares}\label{ordinary-shares-1}}

These carry the primary voting rights of the company, the right to a
dividend if declared, and rights to participate in a surplus in a
winding up.

If no differences between shares are expressed, it is assumed that all
shares have the same rights.

A company may, at its option, attach special rights to different shares,
for example as regards dividends, return of capital or voting (or less
often the right to appoint a director).

Ordinary shares without voting rights are often called ``A'' ordinary
shares.

\hypertarget{preference-shares-1}{%
\subsubsection{Preference Shares}\label{preference-shares-1}}

A preference share is any share having priority over the ordinary
shares. The priority might be in relation to capital or dividends, or
(usually) both. There are no other implied differences between the two.

The preferential dividend may be cumulative, or it may be payable only
out of the profits of\\
each year. The dividend will usually be fixed (expressed as a fixed
percentage of the par value of the share).

Do not usually carry a vote.

\hypertarget{articles}{%

There is nothing allowing issue of redeemable shares in MA, so a special
article would need to be inserted. The articles must also provide for
the terms and manner of redemption.

The directors of a private company can decide the conditions of
redemption if they are authorised by an \textbf{ordinary resolution} of
the members or by the articles (CA 2006, s 685(1)). Generally,
redeemable shares have to be redeemed from distributable profits, but
private companies may redeem out of capital if so permitted by their
articles (CA 2006, s 687), upon the passing of a special resolution and
the directors making a declaration of solvency.

\hypertarget{redemption}{%
\paragraph{Redemption}\label{redemption}}

\textbf{Redeemed} shares are treated as being cancelled. A notice must
be sent to the Registrar of Companies within one month of the shares
being redeemed, along with an amended statement of capital (CA 2006, ss
688 and 689)--both included in \textbf{Form SH02}.

\hypertarget{offering-shares-to-the-public}{%
\subsection{Offering Shares to the
Public}\label{offering-shares-to-the-public}}

Private companies are in general prohibited from offering their shares
to the investing public at large (FSMA 2000, s 75(3)).

Offering shares to the public in contravention of the prohibition
against doing so is not a criminal offence, but the court may order
re-registration of the private company as a public company, or may make
a remedial order which could include repurchase of the shares by the
company (CA 2006, ss 757--759).

A dividend is a ``distribution'' under the definition in
\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/829}{s 829(1)
CA 2006}, which states that ``distribution'' means every description of
distribution of a company's assets to its members, whether in cash or

\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/830}{s 830(1)

whether a company has sufficient distributable profits for the payment
of dividends.

Most recent annual accounts must usually be referred to. In some
circumstances, specially prepared interim accounts may be appropriate,
e.g., when a company has realised a substantial profit since the annual
accounts were prepared.

For a new company without annual accounts, initial accounts may be
prepared to justify paying a dividend.

The profits of a company belong to the company (separate legal
personality). The usual way for a shareholder to ultimately receive the
company's accumulated profits is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  During the company's lifetime when it pays a dividend
\item
  During the winding up of the company while it is still solvent.
\end{enumerate}

A buyback out of existing share capital may also increase the company's
changes of becoming insolvent. The principle of maintenance of share
capital is designed to safeguard against this.

\hypertarget{types-of-security}{%
\subsection{Types of Security}\label{types-of-security}}

\hypertarget{mortgages}{%
\subsubsection{Mortgages}\label{mortgages}}

Highest form of security.

The security provider retains possession of the asset, but transfers
ownership to the creditor. Subject to the security provider's right to
require the creditor to transfer the asset back to it when the debt is
repaid. Right is known is the `{[}{[}equity of redemption{]}{]}'. The
equity of redemption is held in reserve and only exercised if the
borrowed money is not repaid.

A type of mortgage (known as ``charge by way of legal mortgage'' or
``charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage''--s 87 LPA
1925) is usually taken over land. Ownership will remain vested in the
security provider in this case.

\hypertarget{charges}{%
\subsubsection{Charges}\label{charges}}

A form of security which does not transfer legal ownership from the
chargor (company) to the chargee (lender).

Rather than transferring ownership, this involves the creation of an
equitable proprietary interest in the asset, in favour of the creditor.

As well as the equitable proprietary interest, the charging document
will give the lender certain contractual rights over the asset. These
often include the right to appoint a receiver/ administrator to take
possession of the house and sell it, if the debt is not paid back. Two
types of charge: fixed and floating charges.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.5000}}

Description
\end{minipage} \\
\midrule()
\endhead
Fixed charge & Prevents the borrower from dealing with the assets
subject to the charge. This is the strongest form of security. \\
Floating charge & `Floats' over a class of assets. It does not prevent
the borrower from dealing with these assets, unless and until the
floating charge `crystallises'. This usually happens when the borrower
defaults on the loan repayments. \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

The label applied to a charge is not always determinative, necessary to
look at the terms of the charge itself ({[}{[}Agnew v IRC {[}2001{]} 2
BCLC 188, PC{]}{]}).

\hypertarget{fixed-charge}{%
\subsubsection{Fixed Charge}\label{fixed-charge}}

Where a fixed charge is granted, the lender will control the borrower's
use of the charged asset.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The company cannot deal with the assets subject to the charge without
  the consent of the lender.
\item
  A separate fixed charge must be created over each asset.
\item
  The charge holder will require the company to keep the asset in good
  condition.
\item
  If the charge becomes enforceable, the lender has the ability to
  appoint a receiver, and exercise a power of sale over the asset.
\end{itemize}

The creditor will usually prefer this, but it is not always appropriate.
For instance, a fixed charge will not be applicable for stock/ raw
materials which the borrower will need to use daily in the course of
business. More likely to be taken over assets like plant and machinery.

The prevention of the chargor from freely disposing of the asset is
crucial to the creation of a fixed charge ({[}{[}Ashborder BV v Green
Gas Power Ltd {[}2004{]} {]}{]}).

\hypertarget{floating-charges}{%
\subsubsection{Floating Charges}\label{floating-charges}}

Most companies are unable to grant fixed charges for the majority of
their assets.

With a floating charge, whatever assets in a particular class that a
borrower owns at any point in time are subject to the floating charge.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{In [[Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association [1904] AC 355]], a floating charge was defined as}

\NormalTok{{-} A class of assets, present and future; and}
\NormalTok{{-} Which in the ordinary course of the company\textquotesingle{}s business changes from time to time; and}
\NormalTok{{-} It is contemplated that until the holders of the charge take steps to enforce it, the company may carry on business in the ordinary way as far as concerns the assets charged.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Possible to create more than one floating charge over the same group of
assets. The asset are usually identified generically (e.g., ``stock'').

\hypertarget{crystallisation}{%
\paragraph{Crystallisation}\label{crystallisation}}

When a floating charge crystallises, it ceases to float over all the
assets in a class and instead fixes onto the assets in the class charged
at the time of crystallisation. The lender then has control of these
assets, and the borrower is unable to deal with them, as if the assets
were subject to a fixed charge.

However, the assets subject to crystallisation of the floating charge
are \textbf{not} treated as fixed charge assets for distribution
purposes on a winding up.

If the company receives more assets of the same class after
crystallisation, these are automatically subject to the crystallisation
charge ({[}{[}NW Robbie and Co v Whitney Warehouse Co Ltd {[}1963{]} 1
WLR 1324, CA{]}{]}).

The triggering events for crystallisation are set out in contract.

Crystallisation occurs:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In common law, on a winding up, appointment of a receiver or cessation
  of business
\item
  Specified event---as defined in the loan agreement. This usually
  occurs where a borrower defaults on the loan repayments or interest
  payments, or where another lender enforces their security.
\end{enumerate}

  Disadvantages

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A fixed charge will generally take priority over a floating charge
    over the same assets.
  \item
    Company could sell existing stock and not purchase new stock to
    replace it, if there is just a floating charge over stock.
  \item
    Preferential creditors also take priority over the holder of a
    floating charge (e.g., employees, pension payments ({[}{[}Bloom and
    others v Pensions Regulator (Nortel, Re) {[}2010{]} EWHC 3010
    (Ch){]}{]}), ring-fenced amount for the unsecured creditors).
  \item
    Under s 245 IA 1986, in certain circumstances a floating charge is
    automatically void and a liquidator/ administrator can set it aside
    (basically if created at the `relevant time' where it was obvious
    the company would fail).

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      In Re Comet Group Limited, the judge described its purpose as ``to
      prevent a company that is on its last legs from creating a
      floating charge to secure past debts or to secure moneys which do
      not go to swell its assets and become available for creditors''.

\hypertarget{book-debts}{%
\subsubsection{Book Debts}\label{book-debts}}

Book debt is an unpaid invoice, i.e., a sum owed to the company in
respect of goods or services supplied by it.

Book debts are a fluctuating asset, and may be a significant asset of
the company.

In early cases, the courts took the approach that a charge granted over
book debts was a fixed charge, but this approach has now been overruled.

{[}{[}Siebe Gorman and Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd {[}1979{]} 2 Lloyd's
Rep 142{]}{]} & The court held that a charge over book debts was a fixed
charge because of the degree of control of the bank which could stop the
company making withdrawals, even when the account was in credit. Since
overruled. \\
{[}{[}Re Brightlife Ltd {[}1987{]} Ch 200 ChD{]}{]} & The court in this
case clarified that a company's bank balance is not a book debt and
therefore cannot be subject to a fixed charge. \\
{[}{[}Re Keenan Bros Ltd {[}1986{]} BCLC 242{]}{]} & A fixed charge was
created by the means of a requirement that the funds collected by the
company were to be paid into a blocked account. The prior written
consent of the bank was required before any funds were allowed to be
withdrawn from this account. Here the court said that the charge was a
fixed charge due to the fact that the account was blocked. \\
{[}{[}Re Brumark Investments Ltd {[}2001{]} {]}{]} & The company's
freedom to collect and use the proceeds of the book debts as it wished
without requiring the lender's consent was inconsistent with the nature
of a fixed charge. This was a Privy Council case, which means that it is
persuasive but not binding. \\

\end{longtable}

Eventually, the position was resolved in {[}{[}National Westminster Bank
plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others {[}2005{]} UKHL 41{]}{]}. It is
now very difficult to demonstrate the requisite level of control over
book debts for a fixed charge. It would require at least a blocked
account.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{title: Charge over book debts}

\NormalTok{From the case of [[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41]] it is only possible to have a fixed charge over book debts if they are paid into a blocked account which gives the lender the degree of control required.}

\NormalTok{**Book debts can only be secured by a fixed charge where the charge holder has control over both the debts and the proceedds once they were paid.**}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The court will look at the substance of an arrangement, not the title.

\hypertarget{guarantee}{%
\subsubsection{Guarantee}\label{guarantee}}

Guarantees are not securities strictly, since they do not give rise to
assets. But their commercial effect is similar to security.

A guarantee for a loan means an agreement that the guarantor will pay
the borrower's debt if the borrower fails to do so.

Common for a director-shareholder to be compelled to give such a
personal guarantee to secure a bank loan.

\hypertarget{pledge}{%

  guarantee a loan.
\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{registration}{%
\subsection{Registration}\label{registration}}

The registration regime changed on 06/04/13. It used to be compulsory to
register most charges, now it is voluntary. But if the charge is not
registered in time, there are consequences (e.g., may become void).

Guarantees don't need registering, mortgages and fixed/ floating charges
usually do. For other stuff (loans, pledges), solicitors will usually
register out of an abundance of caution.

\hypertarget{procedure-3}{%
\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-3}}

Once agreement has been entered into, the company/ any person interested
in the charge should deliver (s 859A(2)):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A s 859D statement of particulars to Companies House (s 859A(2))

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This will usually be Form MR01
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  A certified copy of the instrument creating the charge (s 859A(3))
\end{enumerate}

Also:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859A}{s
  859A(4) CA 2006}~states that the charge must be registered within
  \textbf{21 days} beginning with~\textbf{the day after the date of
  creation}~of the charge. Any person interested in the charge may
  complete the registration formalities (usually done by the lender).
\item
  If the charge is not registered within the 21-day period,
  under~\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859H}{s
  859H(3) CA 2006}, the charge is void as against a liquidator,
  administrator, or creditor of the company and the debt becomes
  immediately payable. This means that the holder of the charge is
  reduced to an unsecured creditor. It is therefore crucial to register
  the security on time so that it is enforceable in priority to other
  creditors.
\item
  Certified copies of all charges must be kept at the company's
  registered office
  (\href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859P}{s
  859P CA 2006}) or SAIL (s 859Q).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Failure to do this is a criminal offence, but does not affect the
    charge in any way.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

After documents have been delivered, the Registrar of Companies must
register the charge (s 859A(2)). 12-digit reference code allocated. A
copy of the charge will be put on the register (s 859I(3)). This is
conclusive evidence that the charge has been properly registered (s
859I(6)).

\hypertarget{other-registers}{%
\subsubsection{Other Registers}\label{other-registers}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If a fixed charge is taken over land, must be registered both at
  Companies House and at the Land Registry.
\item
  Separate registers for charges over specialist assets.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{failure-to-register}{%
\subsubsection{Failure to Register}\label{failure-to-register}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Failure to register the charge renders the charge void against a liquidator or an administrator of the company, and also against the company’s other creditors (CA 2006, s 859H(3)).}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

So another creditor registering a charge over the same asset later will
take priority. A liquidator/ administrator can ignore the charge
completely when dividing up resources.

The security remains valid against the company itself, although the
money secured by the charge becomes payable immediately (CA 2006, s
859H(4)).

\hypertarget{late-inaccurate-delivery}{%
\subsubsection{Late/ Inaccurate
Delivery}\label{late-inaccurate-delivery}}

Under \href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/859F}{s
859F CA 2006}, the court has the power to extend the period for
registration where the grounds of s 859F(2) are met:

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  that the failure to deliver those documents-\\
\item
  was accidental or due to inadvertence or to some other sufficient
  cause, or\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  is not of a nature to prejudice the position of creditors or
  shareholders of the company, or\\
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

The court will allow the register to be rectified provided this does not
prejudice any other charges created between the date of creation of the
unregistered charge and the date of eventual registration
({[}{[}Barclays Bank plc v Stuart Landon Ltd {[}2001{]} 2 BCLC
316{]}{]}).

If an application is successful, the charge will have priority only from
the date of actual registration, so may lose priority due to the delay
if other charges have been registered in the meantime.

The court has also refused to allow a charge to be registered late,
where the time elapsed is too long ({[}{[}Victoria Housing Estates Ltd v
Ashpurton Estates Ltd {[}1982{]}{]}{]}).

The court has power:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Under s 859M to allow rectification of a statement/ notice delivered
  to the Registrar for inaccurate details.
\item
  Under s 859N if the charging document was defective/ wrong document
  was sent, can be replaced.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{redemption-of-loan}{%
\subsubsection{Redemption of Loan}\label{redemption-of-loan}}

When the loan secured by a registered charge is repaid by the company to
the lender, a person with an interest in the registration of the charge
(such as a director of the company) may, but is not obliged to,
complete, sign and send \textbf{Form MR04} to the Registrar of Companies
at Companies House. This is usually done to ensure the company's file is
up-to-date.

\hypertarget{release-of-charge-sale-of-property}{%
\subsubsection{Release of charge/ Sale of
Property}\label{release-of-charge-sale-of-property}}

If, instead of the loan being paid off, the lender decides to release
the company's property from the charge or allows the company to sell the
asset covered by the charge, a person with an interest in the
registration of the charge (such as a director of the company) must
complete, sign and send \textbf{Form MR05} to the Registrar of Companies
at Companies House.

\hypertarget{priority-of-charges}{%
\subsection{Priority of Charges}\label{priority-of-charges}}

Provided the charges are all registered properly under s 859A of the CA
2006:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A fixed charge or mortgage will take priority over a floating charge
  over the same asset, even if the floating charge was created before
  the fixed charge or mortgage.
\item
  If there is more than one fixed charge and mortgage over the same
  asset, they have priority in order of their date of creation (and not
  their date of registration).
\item
  If there is more than one floating charge over the same asset, they
  have priority in order of their date of creation (and not their date
  of registration).
\end{itemize}

See {[}{[}Statutory order of priority on winding up{]}{]}.

\hypertarget{subordination}{%
\subsubsection{Subordination}\label{subordination}}

It is possible for creditors to enter into an agreement between
themselves to alter the order of priority of the charges, in a ``deed of
priority''.

\hypertarget{negative-pledge}{%
\subsubsection{Negative Pledge}\label{negative-pledge}}

It is usual to create a `negative pledge' clause, prohibiting the
company from creating later charges with priority to a floating charge,
without the floating charge holder's permission. If a subsequent lender
takes a charge over the same asset and has actual knowledge of the
negative pledge clause, then the subsequent lender will be subordinate
to the original charge holder ({[}{[}English and Scottish Mercantile
Investment Company Ltd v Brunton {[}1892{]} 2 QB 700{]}{]}).

The existence of a negative pledge clause is identified by completing a
section of Form MR01 sent to Companies House, and the clause itself will
be included in the certified copy of the charging document which is
delivered to the Registrar.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{The agreement for the subsequent charge should contain a covenant (contractual promise) by the company to the effect that there are no earlier charges which are subject to a negative pledge clause. If this is not true, the company will be in breach of that agreement and it may be terminated immediately.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
