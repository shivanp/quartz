# Debt finance

## Introduction

Since private companies are unable to offer shares to the public ([s 755 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/755)), many instead raise finance through debt finance.

Most companies have unrestricted power to borrow, but a company's articles must be checked for restrictions.

Debt finance can broadly be categorised as either:

- Loan facilities
- Debt securities

A key method of protection is for a lender to take security over the assets of the borrowing company.

## Loan Facilities

> A loan facility is an agreement between a borrower and a lender which gives the borrower the right to borrow money on the terms set out in the agreement.

These include:

Loan facility | Description
---|---
Overdraft | On-demand facility, meaning the bank can call for all the money owed to it at any point in time and demand it is paid immediately. This is therefore unsuitable as a long-term borrowing facility.
Term loan | Loan of money for a fixed period of time, repayable on a certain date. Early repayment cannot be demanded unless the borrower breaches the agreement, and the lender will receive interest.
Revolving credit facility | Borrower has flexibility to borrow and repay. The borrower has flexibility to choose when it borrows and repays against a maximum aggregate amount of capital provided by the lender.

## Debt Securities

> In return for finance provided by an investor, the company issues a security acknowledging the investor's rights. At the maturity date of the security, the company pays the value of the security back to the holder.

The classic example is a bond: the issuer promises to pay the value of the bond to the holder of that bond at maturity. Interest is also paid, usually bi-annually. Bonds are traded on the capital market(s). The holder of the bond at maturity will receive the value of the bond back from the issuer.

Private companies can only issue bonds to targeted investors, and not to the public indiscriminately (s 755 CA 2006 again).

## Debt Finance Documents

### Term Sheet

Statement of the key terms of the transaction, including:

- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Fees to be paid
- Key representations, undertakings and events of default

This is equivalent to the heads of terms in other transactions. It is not intended to be a legally binding document; only a statement of understanding.

### Loan Agreement

Sets out the main commercial terms of the loan, including:

- Amount of interest,
- Dates on which interest will be paid
- Dates on which the principal needs to be repaid
- Any fees due

More detailed than the term sheet. This is a heavily negotiated document.

### Security Document

If a loan is secured, a separate security document is negotiated and entered into.

## Debentures

Two meanings of debenture:

1. Under [s 738 CA 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/738) debenture covers any form of debt security issued by a company, including debenture stock, bonds and any other securities of a company, whether or not constituting a charge on the assets of the company.
2. Also refers to the name of the particular documents which creates a security (usually used in this sense by lawyers). This is a separate document from the loan agreement, setting out the details of the security (as opposed to the terms of the loan)

## Terms in Loan Agreements

### Representations

Usually referred to as representations and warranties. These are statements of facts as to the legal and commercial matters made on the signing of the loan agreement, and repeated periodically during the life of the loan.

### Undertakings

Undertakings/ covenants are promises to do/ not do something, or to procure that something is done/ not done.

### Event of Default

Breaches of either representations and undertakings are important clauses. Breaches of either gives the bank contractual remedies where the breach constitutes an event of default. This is vital in terms of giving the bank the power to call in its money early if the borrower shows signs of becoming an enhanced credit risk.
