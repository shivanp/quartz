# Limited liability partnership

## Characteristics

- Introduced by the [Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/12/contents).

| Section | Pertains to |
| ------- | ----------- |
|[s 1 LLPA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/12/section/1) | Limited liability partnerships definition (body corporate, unlimited capacity, members have liability)
|[s 2 LLPA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/12/section/2)| Incorporation document etc.

- **Separate legal personality**: can own property and enter contracts on its own behalf.
- But treated like a [[Business Law and Practice/Company Law/Business models/Partnership]] for tax purposes (each partner liable to pay tax on their share of the income or gains of LLP). Referred to as tax transparency.
- s 2(1)(a) LLPA 2000 says two or more persons associated with carrying on a lawful business with a view to profit can incorporate an LLP. A 'person' in this context can be a company as well as an individual.
- All partners have limited liability. Their liability to third parties is limited to the amount that they have agreed to pay under the terms of their partnership agreement.
- Registered at Companies House, required to file annual accounts and other information. Hybrid between traditional partnership (with procedural flexibility) and company (with limited liability).
- Many law and accountancy firms have this structure.

## Organisational Structure

The organisational structure of an LLP is generally very flexible and should be decided amongst partners in a formal written Members' Agreement. If there is no Agreement, default provisions from Regulations 7 and 8 of [Limited Liability Partnerships Regulations 2001](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/1090/contents/made).

| Section | Pertains to |
| ------- | ----------- |
|[reg 5 LLPR 2001](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/1090/regulation/5/made) | Application of the 1986 Act to Limited Liability partnerships (almost all of it applies)
|[reg 7 LLPR 2001](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/1090/regulation/7/made) | Default provision for limited liability partnerships (equal share in capital and profits, indemnifying members of personal liabilities, management, remuneration,â€¦)
|[reg 8 LLPR 2001](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/1090/regulation/8/made) | No majority of the members can expel any member unless a power to do so has been conferred by express agreement between the members

- Members share equally capital and profits (reg 7 LLPR 2001).
- Every member may take part in management, but no member is entitled to remuneration for acting in business or management of the LLP (reg 7 LLPR 2001).
- LLP indemnifies members for payments made, and personal liabilities incurred by them in ordinary and proper course of business.
- No person can become a member or assign membership without unanimous consent.
- Ordinary decision-making by the majority of members. Change to the nature of business requires consent of all members.
- No implied powers of expulsion: a member cannot be expelled by majority vote unless all the members have previously agreed that a majority can do this.
- If one person decided to leave, the LLP will continue. If there are only 2 members and one leaves, then the LLP is only allowed to drop to one designated member for up to 6 months before it is wound up by the court.
