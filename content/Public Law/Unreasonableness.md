## Introduction

A further ground of challenge raised in judicial review is that a public body has acted unreasonably. This ground of review is conceptually more nebulous than that of illegality. The broad idea underlying the ground was expressed in the following terms by Lord Wrenbury in [[Roberts v Hopwood [1925] AC 578]]:
> 'A person … must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably.’

## Wednesbury test

The idea can be traced back at least as far as the [[Rooke’s Case (1598) 5 Co. Rep. 99b]]. However, in its modern form it became known as ‘Wednesbury unreasonableness’ following the judgment of the Court of Appeal in [[Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1947] 2 All ER 680]].

The case is important because Lord Greene reviewed existing case law and attempted to summarise what he considered to be well-established principles through which the courts could contemplate interference with executive decisions. He emphasised that it was not for a court to interfere merely because it holds a different view on a matter of policy to that of the relevant public body and, in that sense, considers that the authority's decision may be unreasonable.

> [!test]
> Greene’s opinion that the court would be able to undertake a review where 'a decision on a competent matter is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it’ has become known as the Wednesbury test.

Precisely what would be so unreasonable to meet the test was not discussed in any depth by Lord Greene. However, he did provide one example. He drew upon the judgment of Warrington LJ in [[Short v Poole Corporation [1926] Ch 66]] which gave an example of a red-haired teacher being dismissed just because she had red hair.

## Reformulation

There have been some attempts to reformulate the basis of this ground.

In the GCHQ case ([[Council for the Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374]]), Lord Diplock preferred to use the term 'irrationality' to describe unreasonableness. He explained that: 
> 'It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.’

In [[R v Devon CC, ex parte George [1988] 3 WLR 1386]], Lord Donaldson argued against this approach, however, as he felt that it cast doubt upon the mental capacity of the decision-maker. It is probably better now to see irrationality as a sub-category of unreasonableness.

Lord Cooke in [[R v Chief Constable of Sussex, ex parte International Trader’s Ferry [1999] 2 AC 418]] also disapproved of Lord Greene's formulation, describing it as tautologous and exaggerated. He preferred to ask more simply whether the decision in question was 'one which a reasonable authority could reach’.

Lord Cooke's formulation, for all its simplicity, still has its own problems, however; what one authority might conclude may be different from another, yet both may be reasonable.

## Classes of unreasonableness

According to De Smith & Jowell, there are three main classes of unreasonableness that have been identified by the courts:

1. Material defects in the decision-making process
	- These are defects that are not faulty in terms of 'illegality', but which are serious enough to render a decision flawed.
	- Can be subdivided into:
		- Wrongly weighing-up relevant factors
		- Failure to provide a comprehensive chain of reasoning: ‘irrationality’
2. Oppressive decisions
3. Decisions that violate constitutional principles.

#### Wrongly weighing up relevant factors

- [[West Glamorgan CC v Rafferty [1987] 1 All ER 1005]]
- [[Re Duffy [2008] UKHL 4]]

#### Failure to provide a comprehensive chain of reasoning

- [[R v Secretary of State for Environment, ex parte Fielder Estates (Canvey Ltd) (QBD) [1998] 3 PLR 62]]
- [[R v Secretary State for Health, ex parte Luff [1992] 1 FLR 59]]
- [[R v North-West Lancashire Health Authority, ex parte A, D and G [2000] 1 WLR 977]]
- [[R (Rogers) v Swindon NHS Primacy Care Trust & Secretary of State for Heath [2006] EWCA Civ 392]]
- [[Bank Mellat v HM Treasury (No 2) [2013] UKSC 39]]
- [[R (DSD and NBV) v The Parole Board [2018] EWHC 694]]

#### Oppressive decisions

Where a decision imposes excessive hardship or represents an infringement of rights, which is deemed unnecessary, the courts will consider it to be oppressive and therefore in that sense unreasonable. A particular example is the imposition of a penalty for legal behaviour, as seen in [[Wheeler v Leicester City Council [1985] AC 1054]].

In [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Norney [1995] 7 Admin LR 861]] a policy applied by the Home Office was considered unreasonable.

See also [[R v Barnsley MBC, ex parte Hook [1976] 3 All ER 452]].


#### Decisions that violate constitutional principles

In order to uphold the rule of law, decisions made by public bodies should be consistent and rules should be sufficiently certain. Decisions that contradict these principles can be held to be unreasonable, as they represent arbitrary decision-making and can lead to inequality before the law ([[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte McCartney [1994] COD 528]]).

#### Uncertainty

[[Percy v Hall [1997] QB 924]]

## Context

When considering the topic of unreasonableness, it is not only necessary to consider the technical basis on which the relevant decision may be challenged; it is also important to assess the context in which the decision has been reached. This will determine the approach of the court when it comes to the degree or extent of judicial intervention.

This secondary, albeit equally important consideration, is relevant in the context of unreasonableness, and also legitimate expectation, as these are 'substantive' grounds of judicial review. Such grounds may purport to criticise the substance of a decision, as opposed to or as well as, the manner in which it was made.

## Intensity of review

The degree to which the courts will scrutinise decisions is known as intensity of review. It can be seen as a practical manifestation of how the theory of the separation of powers operates when the courts scrutinise executive actions and decisions.

The courts will tend to distinguish between two different ends of a spectrum of subject matter. Note that the courts are not making a formal calculation on this point but are instead coming to a background contextual judgement which will influence their approach and may have an important bearing on the outcome of cases before them.

The courts’ approach to the intensity of review reflects the interplay of two closely related ideas:

| Concept                    | Explanation                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constitutional entitlement | The courts tend to be reluctant to interfere with the decisions of democratically elected officials on questions of policy. |
| Institutional competence   | Fundamental rights have traditionally been seen as something the courts are under a strong duty to protect. Not only should the courts scrutinise decisions concerning fundamental rights more closely; judges are also more experienced, knowledgeable and skilled in assessing these kinds of questions. On the other hand, they are less experienced in the evaluation of ‘high policy’ matters, notably those involving national defence, security and allocation of public resources.   |

#### Separation of powers

When the courts are asked to review executive decisions under substantive as opposed to procedural or jurisdictional grounds of review, they will distinguish between matters within their own judicial competence and matters which they consider are better left to government. A higher degree of deference will equate to a lower intensity of review.

#### Traditional Wednesbury standard

The standard of review, set out by Lord Greene in Wednesbury, was based on the following formulation:

> '[if] a decision on a component matter is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have come to it, then the courts can interfere’.

This represents a very high threshold for an applicant to overcome – a notably high or exceptional level of unreasonableness would have to be found.

Consequently, the original standard has been modified in some situations by the judiciary, representing an example of how the common law can respond and evolve to meet the need to protect rights and other fundamental interests.

#### Social and economic policy considerations

It remains the case that the courts are reluctant to review decisions relating to social and economic policy. They operate a higher degree of deference (and therefore apply a lower intensity of review) to the decision-maker in such circumstances. This means that the traditional Wednesbury standard with its very high threshold continues to apply in this area.

In [[Nottinghamshire County Council v Secretary of State for the Environment (1986) AC 240]] the court coined the phrase 'super-Wednesbury’ to denote these areas of policy decision-making, which are deemed to be political and not within the proper ambit for judicial review, (other than in exceptional circumstances). The question before the court was whether it could intervene to quash the Environment Secretary's guidance to local authorities, setting public spending limits. This guidance had been approved as a statutory instrument by Parliament, however, and so was seen by the court to have had the 'seal of democratic approval’. Lord Scarman said:
> ‘Unless and until a statute provides otherwise, or it is established that the Secretary of State has abused his power, these are matters of political judgement for him and for the House of Commons. They are not for the judges.'

In [[R v Cambridge District Health Authority, ex parte B [1995] 1 WLR 898]], Sir Thomas Bingham MR stated that decisions about how a 'limited budget is allocated to maximum advantage for the maximum number of patients' was not something a court should make, notwithstanding the compelling factual circumstances. (The case involved a child who was being denied additional important medical treatment for leukaemia by the health authority.)

However, the involvement of matters of high policy does not automatically prevent the court from intervening. In [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Javed [2001] EWCA 789]], the Court of Appeal held that the minister had acted irrationally when he made a statutory instrument, which designated Pakistan as a country in which 'in general there is no risk of persecution’. This went against an abundance of evidence that persecution was widespread in Pakistan at the time.

#### Decisions affecting fundamental rights

The reverse side of the deference coin is that in some circumstances the courts are increasingly willing to exercise a more intense degree of scrutiny when assessing the reasonableness of a decision. This point assumed particular prominence in the late 1980s and 1990s on issues concerning fundamental or human rights. In terms of the traditional Wednesbury standard, this heightened standard became known as ‘sub-Wednesbury’

In the case of [[Bugdaycay v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1987] AC 514]], Lord Bridge said that the courts are entitled:

> '... to subject an administrative decision to the more rigorous examination, to ensure that it is in no way flawed, according to the gravity of the issue which the decision determines. The most fundamental of all human rights is the individual's right to life and when an administrative decision under challenge is said to be one which may put the applicant's life at risk, the basis of the decision must surely call for the most anxious scrutiny.’

Even where a heightened scrutiny is applied in the context of unreasonableness, this will not necessarily be sufficient for a challenge to be successful, as demonstrated in [[R v Ministry of Defence, ex parte Smith [1996] QB 517]]. 

In [[R (Rogers) v Swindon NHS Primacy Care Trust & Secretary of State for Heath [2006] EWCA Civ 392]] a relatively intense degree of scrutiny was applied, despite there being no formal argument put forward on human rights grounds.

Note that this case, unlike _Smith,_ was heard after the Human Rights Act 1998 (‘HRA’) came into force (in 2000). The court recognised that, although Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’) had not been specifically raised, the case concerned a decision that may involve a life-or-death decision for Ms Rogers, and it therefore concluded that rigorous scrutiny was appropriate.

| Standard of judicial review | Applied to                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Sub-Wednesbury standard     | High intensity review, fundamental rights. |
| Super-Wednesbury standard   | Low intensity review, social and economic policy.                                          |


## Proportionality

The HRA has provided further development of judicial scrutiny in respect of decisions that affect fundamental rights. 

> [!important]
> When human rights protected by the ECHR are engaged, the relevant test to be applied by the courts is that of proportionality rather than Wednesbury unreasonableness.

Proportionality is the general approach in EU law as well.

#### Proportionality as an independent JR ground?

In GCHQ, Lord Diplock suggested that in future there may be additions to the three heads of review which he identified at that time. One of the possible new grounds he referred to was proportionality.

> [!test]
> The doctrine of proportionality requires in general terms that the means employed by a decision-maker to achieve a legitimate aim must be no more than is necessary to achieve that aim.

There has been considerable comment and contention, judicially and academically, about the nature of the proportionality test and its application to public law cases, in which ECHR (or EU law) rights are not engaged.

The orthodox view of the place of proportionality in UK law was set out in [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991] 1 AC 696]]. In that case, the relevant decision was challenged both on the basis that it was Wednesbury unreasonable and that it was disproportionate. In declining to recognise an independent ground of proportionality, Lord Ackner stated that:
> ‘Unless and until Parliament incorporates the convention [i.e. the ECHR] into domestic law … there appears to me to be at present no basis upon which the proportionality doctrine applied by the European Court can be followed by the courts of this country …'

#### Challenges to orthodox position

This orthodox position with regard to proportionality in domestic administrative law has been challenged in a number of subsequent cases.

In [[R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] UKHL 26]] Lord Cooke was strongly critical of the Wednesbury test:
> ‘The day will come when it will be more widely recognised that … Wednesbury … was an unfortunately retrogressive decision in English administrative law … in so far as it suggested that there are degrees of unreasonableness and that only a very extreme degree can bring an administrative decision within the legitimate scope of judicial invalidation.’

Also in Daly, Lord Steyn discussed the distinctions between the Wednesbury standards of review and proportionality. His view was that, whilst most cases would yield the same result, ‘the intensity of review is somewhat greater under the proportionality approach’ which could provide different outcomes. For example, contrast the domestic decision in [[R v Ministry of Defence, ex parte Smith [1996] QB 517]] (discussed above) with the European Court of Human Rights’ decision in [[Smith and Grady v UK (2000) 29 EHRR 493]].

In [[R (Alconbury) v Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions [2001] 2 WLR 1389]] Lord Slynn stated his belief that the time had come to recognise that proportionality was an established principle of administrative law, not just limited to the ECHR and to EU law. He stated that:
> '… trying to keep the Wednesbury principle and proportionality in separate compartments seems to … be unnecessary and confusing.’

However, in [[Association of British Civilian Internees – Far East Region v Secretary of State for Defence [2003] 3 WLR 80]], whilst recognising that arguments for recognising proportionality as a general test applying to all domestic cases were strong, Dyson LJ stated, in relation to Wednesbury unreasonableness, that: 
> ‘it is not for this court [i.e., the Court of Appeal] to perform its burial rites.'

#### *Pham* and subsequent cases

The case of [[Pham v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] UKSC 19]] concerned a decision to deport a Vietnamese-born man and to deprive him of British citizenship. Whilst the discussion of proportionality was ultimately obiter, it marks the most direct engagement of the Supreme Court to date with this standard of review.

Proportionality was again viewed as a more forensic and precise legal test than Wednesbury. However, the court did not feel that it necessarily promoted greater judicial intervention – it could itself be applied with a varying degree of intensity, depending on the constitutional and practical context of the legal issue in dispute.

In [[Keyu v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2015] UKSC 69]] Lord Neuberger suggested that the possible replacement in domestic law of Wednesbury unreasonableness with a proportionality standard should only be sanctioned by a full panel of the UKSC, given that it would represent a very significant constitutional development in domestic law.

in [[Youssef v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2016] UKSC 3]] Lord Carnwath appeared to accept the need for an ‘authoritative review’ of this area of public law by the Supreme Court:
> 'This is a subject which continues to attract intense academic debate. … It is to be hoped that an opportunity can be found in the near future for an authoritative review … of the judicial and academic learning on the issue, including relevant comparative material from other common law jurisdictions. Such a review might aim for rather more structured guidance for the lower courts than such imprecise concepts as “anxious scrutiny” and “sliding scales”.’
