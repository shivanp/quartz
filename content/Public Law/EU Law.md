## European Union and UK membership

History of EU can be traced back to 3 communities:
- European Coal and Steel Community ('ECSC') 1951
- European Economic Community ('EEC') → 1957 Treaty of Rome
- European Atomic Energy Community ('Euratom') 1957

Established by treaties agreed by 6 initial member states. UK joined all three on 01/01/73. 

The EU was established in 1993, by which time membership had increased to 12 states. Increased to 28 by 2013. Then in 2016 UK voted to leave, and left on 31/01/20.

European Communities Act 1972 was repealed by European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Under this statute, lots of EU law continues to have effect in the UK. 

Some of this is to fulfil the requirements of a Withdrawal Agreement between UK and EU, but the bulk of it has been retained to avoid the chaos if it were all repealed at the same time. It has been converted into domestic UK law by the Act. 

## Sources of EU law

Different kinds of acts which the institutions of the EU can undertake:
1. Primary sources (EU treaties and Charter of Fundamental Rights)
2. Secondary sources and acts (regulations, directives and decisions)
3. Tertiary acts
4. Case law
5. International agreements/ treaties
6. Non-binding acts (soft law)

There are also certain overarching legal principles. 

## Primary sources

#### EU treaties

The primary source of EU law is provided by two EU treaties:
1. Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) → this was the EEC renamed
2. Treaty of the European Union (TEU) 1992

These are commonly referred to as the EU's primary legislation. Note that the European Convention on Human Rights is **not** an EU treaty. Article 6(2) TEU provides the European Union with the power to accede to the ECHR, but it has not done so to date. 

#### Charter of Fundamental Rights

This was adopted in 2000 as an authoritative statement of fundamental rights within the EU. It was given legal recognition by the Lisbon Treaty 2007, through article 6(2) TEU. 

Article 6(1) TEU provides that the charter has the same legal status as the treaties. But it is more limited in its application. Article 51 Charter: it only regulates the activities of the EU and those of Member States when they are implementing EU law. It does not confer, extend, or modify any of the powers of the EU under the treaties. 

The Charter can be used to interpret EU law, or to determine the lawfulness of the EU's acts, or of national measures giving effect to EU law. But does not provide an independent source of competence for the EU, or an independent legal basis for its activities. 

Does not apply to Member States in purely domestic situations falling outside EU law. 

## Secondary sources

#### Regulations

Article 288 TFEU: authorises the EU to undertake certain secondary acts. These constitute legislative acts where they are adopted using a legislative procedure (Art 289(3) TFEU). Regulations are one form of secondary legislation; Article 288 provides
> A regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 

“Directly applicable” means the regulation applies in the Member States without those Member States having to enact their own legal measures to implement or give effect to it. 

#### Directives

Directives are another form of secondary legislation. Also provided for by Article 288 TFEU which states that:
> ‘A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.’

So in contrast to regulations, Member States are required to implement directives by enacting their own legal measures to incorporate/ give effect to them in their national law. The deadline for implementing a directive will be specified in the directive (generally two years). If no deadline is specified, the deadline for implementation is 20 days after the publication of the directive (Article 297 TFEU). 

#### Decisions

> ‘A decision shall be binding in its entirety. A decision which specifies those to whom it is addressed shall be binding only on them.’
> Article 288 TFEU

The European Commission may make a decision that a company is in breach of EU competition law, and may decide to impose a fine. A decision will be considered to be secondary legislation if it was adopted using a **legislative procedure** (Art 289(3) TFEU). 

## Tertiary Acts

Two types:

#### Delegated acts

Art 290 TFEU enables EU secondary legislation to delegate the power to the European Commission to adopt delegated acts to supplement or amend that secondary legislation. 

#### Implementing acts

Art 291(2) TEU enables legally binding EU acts to confer on the European Commission the power to adopt acts for implementing those legal binding EU acts, where uniform conditions for implementation are needed. The power can also be conferred on the Council of the European Union in certain circumstances.

## Case law

Judgments of the EU courts in the cases they decide also provide a further source of EU law. Principal courts:
- Court of Justice of the EU
- General Court.

There is no appeal from the national courts of the Member States to the EU courts, but national courts can make preliminary references to the Court of Justice. The Court of Justice will make a ruling (preliminary ruling). The case returns to the national court to apply the ruling of the Court of Justice. 

N.B. the European Court of Human Rights is not one of the courts of the EU. 

## International Agreements/ treaties

Art 47 TEU: confers legal personality on the EU. This gives it the capacity to act on its own behalf within the realm of public international law. 

Art 216(1) TFEU empowers the EU to be able to enter into international agreements. These are binding on EU institutions and Member States (Art 216(2) TFEU). 

Other provisions of TEU and TFEU provide further powers to enter into international agreements in relation to more specific matters. Include agreements on arrangements for States to withdraw from the European Union (Article 50(2) TEU). 

## Non-Binding Acts ('soft law')

Institutions of the EU may also undertake acts which are not binding on anyone:

- Article 288 TFEU: institutions can make opinions and deliver opinions which are non-binding
- Other non-binding acts: communications, declarations, notices, programmes, and resolutions. 

## General principles of EU Law
> [!note]
> The concept of ‘general principles of EU law’ refers to a particular category of overarching legal principles which apply generally across EU law. They are used to aid the interpretation of the more specific rules of EU law, to assess the lawfulness of the activities and secondary legislation of the European Union, and to determine the lawfulness of those activities of the Member States which fall within the scope of EU law.
Some of the general principles were specifically laid down by EU treaties, but many were developed by the Court of Justice, drawing on legal principles that are common to the Member States. These include
- Equality and non-discrimination
	- Prohibition on discrimination on basis of nationality (Art 18 TFEU), sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, and sexual orientation (Art. 19 TFEU)
- Respect for fundamental rights (Art. 6(3) TEU).
	- This includes the rights found in the European Convention of Human Rights (Art. 6(3) TEU) and those in the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights (Art. 6(1) TEU).
- Proportionality
	- An act must be suitable and necessary to attain the object pursued, and must not go further than is required to achieve that objective. 

## Enforcement of EU law

The Court of Justice has developed three different methods for enforcing law:
- Direct effect requires EU legal acts that satisfy certain criteria to be directly enforced in national courts
- Indirect effect requires national courts to interpret their national law in a way that is compatible with EU law, but only in so far as it is possible to do so. 
- State liability: enables individuals to recover compensation in their national courts from a Member State, where they suffered loss as a result of a sufficiently serious breach.

Each method has its own conditions. Possible for an EU act to be unenforceable because it does not satisfy any of these conditions. 

## Supremacy of EU Law

This directs that where a conflict arises between EU law and national law of Member States, national law cannot override EU law. 

If there is no requirement under EU law for a national court to enforce the particular provision of EU law, no conflict between EU law and national law will arise in that national court. 

This is never explicitly called 'supremacy'; it is instead called 'primacy'. 

Key case establishing supremacy of EU law: [[Costa v E.N.E.L. (Case 6 of 64) [1964] ECR 585]]. 

The approach of the Court of Justice to the supremacy of EU law has been absolutist ([[Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v Einfuhr und Vorratstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel (Case 11 of 70) ECLI EU C 1970 114]]). 

The effect has been somewhat mitigated by the Court of Justice adding in the same case that the protection of fundamental rights was itself a general principle of EEC law, so EU law must be itself interpreted and applied in accordance with fundamental rights.
