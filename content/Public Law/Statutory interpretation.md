Statutory interpretation: determining what Parliament intended when it enacted a piece of legislation. Primarily a task for judges. Lawyers must also be familiar with principles. Note it's a subtle balancing act. 

## Linguistic presumptions

#### Expressio unius est exclusio alterius

> “the expression of one thing is to the exclusion of another”

If there is a closed list of items, Parliament intends only to include those items that are stated. 

See [[Tempest v Kilner (1846) 3 CB 249]].

#### Ejusdem generis
>“of the same kind/ genus”

Employed when statute includes a generic but non-exhaustive list of items, and need to decide whether some item would fall within the list. Where general words follow a list of specific words, the general words interpreted to restrict them to the same kind of objects as specific words.

See [[Powell v Kempton Park Racecourse [1899] AC 143]].

#### Noscitur a sociis
>“a word is known by its associates”

The words of a statute are understood in the context of the statute itself. Closely associated with *Ejusdem generis* but wider potential application. 

See [[Inland Revenue Commissioners v Frere [1965] AC 402]]

## Rules

#### Literal rule

Assumed that words used in a statute are to be given their ordinary, plain and natural meaning. Requires an in-depth consideration of the words and phrases of the statute. Linguistic presumptions are an important aid for this method of interpretation. Overly literal can be problematic, though…

#### Golden rule

Literal rule but don't be stupid about it (take ordinary signification of words except where this produces inconsistency, absurdity or inconvenience) Definition was expressed in [[River Wear Commissioners v Adamson (1877) 2 App Cas 743]].

Good example: [[Adler v George [1964] 2 QBD 7]].

#### Mischief rule

Oldest rule, which examines the original purpose of a particular provision under consideration. Four questions considered:
1. What was common law before the making of the Act
2. What was the mischief and defect for which common law did not provide
3. What remedy for the mischief had Parliament intended
4. What was the true reason for Parliament adopting that remedy. 

Note, this rule is now defunct; subsumed into the purposive approach, see below.

#### Purposive approach

Courts look at the law's purpose. Intended to replace the mischief rule. 

Judges will look at the strict meaning of the words contained in a statute, as well as the purpose or objective of the Act in question. If there is a conflict between the two, the judges will interpret the words in the context of and in accordance with the wider purpose of the Act. Judges do not automatically use a purposive approach. However, particularly in the modern day, they naturally tend to assess the overall context within which the Act came about so that, if a literal reading of the words in the statute does not produce a plausible interpretation, they will be informed by this wider context.

Courts have been given additional powers of interpretation under the Human Rights Act 1998 which allow them to interpret legislation in a purposive way to seek compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. 

#### Contemporary approach

Combination of literal and purposive interpretations. Judges will instinctively look at both strict and superficial meaning of words used and at underlying purpose of legislation. Only rarely tension between the two. In these cases purposive will generally prevail where it provides clear answer, otherwise strict (even if uncomfortable).
