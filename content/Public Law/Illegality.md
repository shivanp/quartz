## Introduction

The fundamental principle of Administrative Law is that a public body is not entitled to act in excess of its powers, or ‘_ultra vires’_.

Illegality is the ground of review, which reflects this traditional doctrine. It is designed to ensure that the use of power by the executive is confined within the limits set for it. These are normally prescribed by the governing legislation.

In the case of **_GCHQ_,** Lord Diplock observed that:
> 'By “illegality” as a ground for judicial review, I mean that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making powers and must give effect to it.'

## Categories of illegality

Illegality is a broad notion, which is by no means limited to a basic examination by the court of whether a power exists. For example, a decision-maker may have acted within the power conferred but, in coming to a decision, did not take into account a material consideration. This would render the decision illegal as a result. There are seven sub-categories which have been identified within the concept of illegality:

- Simple illegality (ultra vires)
- Errors of law
- Errors of fact
- Relevant and irrelevant considerations (relevancy)
- Improper purpose
- Fettering discretion
- Unlawful delegation

> Authors employ different categorisations when discussing what amounts to illegality.

## Simple illegality

The term 'ultra vires' is often used as a generic phrase relating to any decision which is tainted by illegality. However, it was traditionally used in a narrower sense, referring to a decision that goes beyond the boundaries of legal power given to the body concerned.

> [!example]
> A hypothetical example would be a police officer arresting a person for parking on a yellow line, when there is simply no power of arrest in such a situation. The arrest would therefore be declared ultra vires.
> 
> Likewise, if the Secretary of State for Health were to pass regulations governing the deployment of the armed forces, this too would be declared ultra vires in the simple or pure sense.
#### Early case law

The case of [[Attorney General v Fulham Corporation [1921] Ch 440]], provides a clear example of the principle at work. 

However, a public body will not have acted unlawfully if it did something that was **reasonably incidental to or consequent** upon a power that it did have. For example, the House of Lords held in [[Westminster Corporation v London & North-West Railway [1905] AC 426]] that a power to build public lavatories could also be used to build a subway under a road that was necessary in order to access those lavatories.


#### Principle of legality

You will recall from constitutional law that the 1990s saw the emergence of a so-called principle of legality.

The courts took an approach to statutory interpretation, which presumed that Parliament did not intend to authorise the infringement of fundamental or 'constitutional' rights, without very specific statutory authorisation. This is a more involved concept than the issue of simple ultra vires. However, it can be seen as an extension of the same theme.

This approach was first adopted in [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Leech (No 2) [1994] QB 198]] and is particularly associated with Lord Hoffmann’s judgment in the case of [[R v SoS Home Department ex parte Simms [2000] ]]

Another example can be found in [[R v Lord Chancellor, ex parte Witham [1997] 2 All ER 779]], where the court held that the parent Act did not authorise the Lord Chancellor to set court fees at such a high level that access to the courts, a fundamental right, was effectively denied. The statutory instrument setting the fees was therefore declared to be ultra vires the Act.

## Errors of law

Errors of law are a natural extension of the ultra vires doctrine. This is a broad concept, but typically involves the decision-maker making a mistake regarding a question of law, for example by misinterpreting the meaning of words in a legislative provision.

In early judicial review cases in this area, an error of law was only reviewable if it involved a question of jurisdiction, i.e., in determining whether a legal power arose in the first place. However, following a case we have considered before, [[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 2 AC 137]], such distinctions were removed.

In Anisminic, the House of Lords ruled that the Foreign Compensation Commission (“FCC”) had misunderstood the rules of the compensation scheme it was supposed to be implementing. Such an error of law meant that the decision had to be quashed.

#### Exceptions to reviewability of errors of law

The House of Lords' decision in [[R v Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page [1993] 1 All ER 97]] has subsequently confirmed that all errors of law are potentially reviewable. Nevertheless, there are some qualifications to this general principle:
- Where the error of law is not decisive to the decision. By 'decisive', it is meant that, but for the error concerned, the decision would have been different.
- Where the decision-maker is interpreting some special system of rules, courts are often unwilling to intervene, for example, with statutes of a university. This was the issue in ex parte Page itself.
- They may also be unwilling to review a decision made by an inferior court on the basis of an error of law where Parliament had expressly provided that the decision of a judge at first instance was to be final. They will also not entertain an application for judicial review of a superior court, such as the High Court, for error of law (see [[Re Racal Communications Ltd [1981] AC 374]]).
- Where the power granted is couched in terms, which are so imprecise, that it is capable of being interpreted in a wide range of different ways ([[R v Monopolies Commission, ex parte South Yorkshire Transport Ltd [1993] 1 All ER 289]]).

#### Recent case law

In [[R (Forge Care Homes Ltd) v Cardiff and Vale University Health Board [2017] UKSC 56]], it was found that the Health Board had misinterpreted s. 49 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001.

## Error of fact

The courts' decisions in this area were, in the past, quite complex and confusing. The courts were traditionally resistant to challenges based on an allegation that the decision-maker had made a mistake of fact, as this was perceived as being too much of an interference in the proper territory of the executive.

However, some types of challenge have been considered by the courts and, in more recent years, this basis of review has become more widely accepted, if not commonplace. There are three types of error of fact which are now susceptible to judicial review:
- Precedent Facts
- No evidence for a Fact
- Ignorance or Mistake of an Established Fact

#### Precedent facts

These were the first type of factual error to be reviewed by the Administrative courts. They occur where a decision-maker's power to decide on a particular matter – its jurisdiction to do so – depends upon it making an initial finding of fact. This is known as a precedent (or jurisdictional) fact.

In [[White and Collins v Minister of Health [1939] 3 All ER 548]], the Court of Appeal held that it could review the local authority’s decision to compulsorily purchase a piece of land on the basis that the determination of a key factual issue went to whether the decision-maker had the necessary power in the first place.

Under the relevant statute, the local authority’s powers of compulsory purchase were dependent on the land in question not being 'parkland’. It mistakenly failed to appreciate’ however, that the land it had purchased was actually part of a park. The Court of Appeal accordingly quashed the decision.

In [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Khawaja [1984] AC 74]], the court found that it could review the factual question of whether the claimant was an ‘illegal entrant’. This had to be shown by the Secretary of State in order for the relevant statutory power to detain him to arise.

#### No evidence for a fact

The second kind of factual error, which can amount to illegality, relates to the so-called 'no evidence rule’.

If a finding of fact, on which a decision is based, is supported by no evidence at all, the courts have felt able to overturn the decision based on it. The first clear case on this point was [[Coleen Properties v Minister of Health and Local Government [1971] 1 WLR 433]].

#### Ignorance or mistake of an established fact

The law on error of fact, aside from jurisdictional challenges and the ‘no evidence rule’, has advanced more slowly. However, accompanied by a degree of controversy, there has been a gradual movement in the direction of a more general ground of review based on errors of what have become known as established facts.

In [[Secretary of State for Education v Tameside MBC [1977] AC 1014]], it was recognised that factual mistake, described by Scarman LJ in the Court of Appeal as 'misunderstanding or ignorance of an established fact' and by Lord Wilberforce in the Lords as acting 'upon an incorrect basis of fact', could be a basis for judicial review.

Subsequently, in [[R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB), ex parte A [1999] 2 AC 330]] four of the law lords accepted (obiter) that a mistake of fact could found a ground for review.

The case of [[E v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49]] has brought clarification to this ground of review and seems to have established conclusively that judicial review can be sought on the basis of a mistaken fact. Carnwath LJ said in that case:

> 'In our view, the time has come to accept that a mistake of fact giving rise to unfairness is a separate head of challenge in an appeal on a point of law, at least in those statutory contexts where the parties share an interest in co-operating to achieve the correct result.’

Drawing upon the judgment in [[R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB), ex parte A [1999] 2 AC 330]], the court held that for ignorance or mistake of an established fact to be reviewable, it must have caused unfairness. Carnwath also laid down a four-part test for determining whether such a mistake had arisen:

> [!test]
> 1. There must have been a mistake as to an existing fact, including a mistake as to the availability of evidence on a particular matter.
> 2. The fact or evidence must have been “established” in the sense that it was uncontentious and objectively verifiable.
> 3. The claimant and legal advisor must not be responsible.
> 4. The mistake must have played a material (though not necessarily decisive) part in the decision-maker’s reasoning.

## Relevant and irrelevant considerations

Decision-makers can act unlawfully if they fail to take a relevant consideration into account, or, take into account an irrelevant consideration. In [[R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings [1995] 3 All ER 20]], a decision to ban stag hunting was ultimately found to be unlawful. In debating the case in the Court of Appeal Simon Brown LJ pointed to three kinds of considerations which may present themselves to a decision-maker. Although he did not label them in the following way, they are often called:

| Factor                | Definition                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mandatory factors     | Those expressly or impliedly identified by the statute to which regard must be had. |
| Prohibitory factors   | Those identified by the statute to which regard must not be had.                    |
| Discretionary factors | Those to which the decision-maker may have regard if in their judgment and discretion it is right to do so.                                                                                    |

#### The courts' role

Decisions that fail to take into account mandatory factors or which do take into account prohibitory factors will clearly be unlawful; this is an extension of the basic ultra vires doctrine, requiring decision-makers to comply properly with the statutory duties given to them by Parliament.

Assuming that it is not irrational to do so, a decision-maker will not be acting unlawfully, however, in taking into account discretionary factors, as long as they have taken other appropriate considerations into account as well.

Deciding which factors or considerations are or are not relevant in any given situation is the role of the court and this requires a full and proper construction of the statutory regime applying and an interpretation of all associated guidance. The clearer the statutory language, the simpler the court’s role is of determining which factors are relevant or not. 

However, where discretionary powers are phrased more broadly, the courts necessarily have more say in determining issues of relevance when assessing if public bodies have acted lawfully or not.

#### Broadly phrased discretionary powers

- This sub-ground of review is exemplified by the high-profile case of [[R v Home Secretary, ex parte Venables and Thompson [1998] AC 407]], in which the two applicants (both aged 10) were convicted of the murder of two-year old James Bulger.
- In [[Roberts v Hopwood [1925] AC 578]], a local authority had failed to consider a relevant factor when increasing wages for its low-wage workers above the market rate. The House of Lords held that, despite its desire to better the workers' conditions, it had had no regard in the process to the interests of ratepayers, who would face higher demands.
- In [[R v Gloucester County Council, ex parte Barry [1997] 2 WLR 459]] the House of Lords held that the local authority's consideration of its own paucity of resources was a relevant factor in assessing the needs of a disabled person in respect of services provided under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970.

However, this is not to say that availability of resources will always be considered relevant. The question is one for the court on a proper construction of the statutory framework applying to the particular situation.

In [[R v East Sussex County Council, ex parte Tandy [1998] 2 All ER 769]], the Council’s decision to reduce the home tuition provided to a child unable to attend school for health reasons, because of financial constraints, was quashed by the law lords. On a proper construction of the Education Act 1993, the court considered that a local authority must determine suitable provision with regard only to the educational needs of the child.

> [!note]
> There is an overlap here with unreasonableness. A court may also or instead quash a decision on unreasonableness grounds which relate to the weighting of competing relevant factors: see the following elements on unreasonableness

## Improper purpose

A decision-maker ought only to use a power given to it by Parliament for the purpose for which it was given that power. The decision-maker acts illegally if it uses the powers for a different purpose.

Note that there is a significant overlap here with the taking into account of irrelevant considerations. For example, in [[R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings [1995] 1 WLR 1037]] the two majority judges, Sir Thomas Bingham MR and Swinton Thomas LJ, viewed the issue mainly in terms of improper purpose. The court determined that the purpose of the power to regulate land use in that case was not to enforce the ethical or political concerns of the local councillors about the cruelty of stag hunting.

Key case: [[Padfield v Ministry of Agriculture [1968] AC 997]].

Sometimes, a statute will clearly indicate the purpose for which it is granting power. In other situations, however, the courts have to imply a purpose by construing the statute as a whole.

See:
-  [[Congreve v Home Office [1976] QB 629]] 
- [[Miranda v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 255 (Admin)]]

## Fettering of discretion

If a public body has acted in a way that has hampered its own ability to properly exercise a discretionary power, it will have 'fettered' its discretion. The most basic way in which this can arise is where it effectively decides not to exercise this power at all ([[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p. Fire Brigades Union [1995] 2 A.C. 513]]).

#### Policies

Another context in which fettering of discretion can arise is when public decision-makers adopt policies in relation to the exercise of their discretionary power. There is nothing objectionable about the adoption of a policy per se. However, the courts will not allow a decision-maker to 'bind' or 'fetter' its discretion by adopting a rigid or ‘blanket’ policy, so that the outcome of a particular case is decided in advance, or made without proper exercise of discretion in response to individual factors.

In [[R v Secretary for the Environment, ex parte Brent LBC [1983] 3 All ER 321]] the court stated that:
> 'The Minister is entitled to have in mind his policy. To this extent the reference to keeping an open mind does not mean an empty mind. His mind must be kept ajar.’

The courts have allowed firm policies to stand provided there is evidence that individual cases could or have been decided on their particular merits. The following two cases can be compared and contrasted:
- [[British Oxygen v Board of Trade [1971] AC 610]]
- [[Ex parte Collymore [1995] ELR 217]]

See also:
- [[R v North-West Lancashire Health Authority, ex parte A, D and G [2000] 1 WLR 977]] 
- [[R (Luton BC and others) v Secretary of State for Education [2011] EWHC 217 (Admin)]]

## Unlawful delegation of discretion

Where a public body is empowered to make a decision by an Act of Parliament, the general rule is that it is not normally allowed to delegate that discretion to another body or person. To do so would be contrary to the intention of Parliament, as expressed in the words of the statute.

e.g., in [[Lavender v Minister of Housing and Local Government [1970] 1 WLR 1231]] the Minister of Housing and Local Government was found to have unlawfully delegated his discretion to the Minister of Agriculture. 

#### Statutory exceptions

Some statutes will expressly allow the decision-maker to delegate decision-making powers to someone else. For example, [s. 101 Local Government Act 1972](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/section/101) authorises local authorities to arrange for their functions to be carried out by committees or by council officers or by another local authority.

#### Carltona principle

Where discretion is conferred on a government minister, the courts will presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the minister is allowed to delegate his discretion to officials (civil servants) within his department, even if the statute does not expressly say so ([[Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560 (CA)]]). The official is deemed to step into the minister’s shoes, and acts in their name, although the minister remains politically accountable to Parliament for decisions made.

#### Extensions

Although the case of Carltona was concerned solely with delegation in the context of central government, the established principle in the case has since been applied more broadly.

In [[R (Chief Constable of West Midlands Police) v Birmingham Justices [2002] EWHC 1087 (Admin)]] the court accepted that a public office holder such as a Chief Constable, could discharge all but the most important of their functions through suitable subordinates such as police officers, for whom they are responsible and answerable.

In [[DPP v Haw [2007] EWHC 1931 (Admin)]], the Divisional Court confirmed that, where an office such as that of Chief Constable is created by statute, and the responsibilities of the office are such that delegation is inevitable, there will be an implied power to delegate. The court did not consider this to be an instance of the Carltona principle as such, as that strictly applies to the ministerial context, but it felt that it was indistinguishable in practice.

The court did stress, however, that the official exercising such a delegated power should be of an appropriate level of seniority, having regard to the nature of the power in question.

#### Applications

In [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Oladehinde [1991] 1 AC 254]], the court held that decisions to deport immigrants could be made by Immigration Inspectors, as they were civil servants. In so finding, Lord Griffiths commented that the 
> ‘decision (to deport)) must be taken by a person of suitable seniority in the Home Office, for whom the Home Secretary accepts responsibility.’

The courts have since continued to emphasise the importance of the constitutional rationale underlying the Carltona principle, namely the need for a sufficient degree of accountability to apply in the relationship between the minister and the relevant official making the decision.

The case of [[R (Bourgass) v Secretary of State for Justice [2015] UKSC 54]] concerned a prison rule which required that: 
> ‘A prisoner shall not be removed under this rule for a period of more than 72 hours without the authority of the Secretary of State…’ 

A prison authority had been putting inmates in solitary confinement for significant periods of time without the approval of the Secretary of State or an official in their department.

Its attempt to justify this action was dismissed by the court on the basis that there was an insufficiently close link between the prison authority and the ministry to ensure the necessary degree of responsibility and accountability.
