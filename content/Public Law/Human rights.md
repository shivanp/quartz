The idea that human beings have rights merely by virtue of being human: no additional tests need to be met. 

## Development

- Natural law theory was the most significant legal product of European Enlightenment
	- Explained bases of legal obligations from an innate canon of legal values, seen to be superior to any national legal authority. 
- Revolutions in France and America led to statements of rights. The US Bill of Rights was the first judicially enforceable rights document. 
- Failure of League of Nations
- UN founded 1945, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 1947
	- Only a resolution of the General Assembly, not 'law'
	- Argued that unanimous acceptance indicates principles binding as customary international law
- 1949 Council of Europe in Strasbourg as forum to promote democracy, [[Rule of Law]] and human rights within Europe (note distinct from EU)
	- Every country in Europe now a member, except Belarus
	- Oversees ECHR
	- Since 1989 Human Rights watchdog for post-communist democracies
- 1950 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
	- 1966 UK gave individuals the right to lodge complaints under ECHR to European Court of Human Rights if all domestic legal remedies had been exhausted.

3 categories of rights under ECHR:
- Absolute rights
	- Cannot be lawfully interfered with in any way by the state
	- Torture, slavery, retrospective criminal offences etc.
- Limited rights
	- Can occasionally be lawfully interfered with
		- Right to life(!), right to liberty and security, right to a fair trial
	- Qualified rights
		- Lawfully interfered with given some legal tests met
		- Right to respect for private and family life, freedom of expression and information, freedom of association and assembly.

Lawful interference means:
1. Interference was prescribed by, or in accordance with, the law
2. Interference in pursuit of a legitimate aim
3. Interference necessary in a democratic society

## UK dualist state

Most European legal systems are monist â€“ treat all forms of law as belonging to a single, binding legal system. UK legal system dualist, treating domestic and international legal orders as wholly separate. 

So international law only applicable in the UK in two distinct circumstances:
- Where UK is party to proceedings before an international court, to which jurisdiction it has agreed to submit
- Where UK has incorporated international legal rules into its domestic legal system through Act of Parliament

## HRA 1998

Incorporated the ECHR into UK domestic law, so the rights in the ECHR were directly enforceable in the domestic courts. Note HRA claims are not made against the UK as a state but against the relevant public authority (central or local Govt, courts and tribunals,...)

## Enforcing rights

- s3(1): Courts should as far as possible interpret UK domestic legislation in a way compatible with ECHR rights
- s3(2): If a court considers that legislation is incompatible with a Convention right, may make a declaration of incompatibility
- s6(1): public authorities required to act in a way which is compatible with Convention rights. Parliament not a public authority for this purpose. 

Later: Indirect horizontal effect, privacy law
