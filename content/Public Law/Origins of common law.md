## Stages of legal development

Time period | Development
---|---
pre-1066 | Locally based systems and customs
1066-1485 | Formation of common law
1485 - 1870s | Development of [[Equity]]; two legal systems co-exist
1870s - present | Joint jurisdiction for common law and [[Equity]], development in statute law etc.


## Monarch source of justice

- After Norman conquest, centralised justice with King as central figure
- King's Council allows monarch to exercise personal prerogative
- King's Court established after Magna Carta (1215)

## 3 courts

King's council turned into:
1. Court of exchequer
2. Court of Common Pleas
3. Court of King's Bench

Royal justices went to provinces to hold assizes (sittings) of royal court. Continued until Courts Act 1971. 

==Court of Exchequer Chamber== as an appeals court until 1875, when jurisdiction transferred to Court of Appeals. 


## Developments

King's Courts became essential to resolution of disputes -> based on common customs of land -> common law. These were recognised as supreme over local courts in Edwardian times. 

## Common Law

Means different things in different contexts:

- In a historical sense meaning the law applied by the King's judges
- Meaning law applied by the King's Courts, as opposed to rules of [[Equity]], system developed in Court of Chancery
- To distinguish [[Case Law]] from statute law
- Law applied in common law countries, vs civil law countries (based on Roman law)

## Writ system

To make a claim at King's court, claimant had to purchase a 'writ' from the Chancellor - a document with a royal seal, constituting a royal demand for defendant to appear before the court. [[Different writs]] for different complaints. Form of writs became rigid; only parliament could issue a new writ. Stunted development of substantive law. 

## Shortcomings

- Procedure over substance: obtaining correct writ and submitting in correct way became more important than rights/ duties
- More a way to resolve and conclude disputes, than to resolve them in a just way
- Offered only damages for personal actions
