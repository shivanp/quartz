## Historical background

- The 'Glorious Revolution' 1688 marked the most significant long-term turning point in English constitutional history. 
- The coup against James II and replacement William III marked the final end of absolutist monarchy in the country. 
- Reflected in key provisions of Bill of Rights 1689 and Act of Settlement 1701
- These pieces of legislation enshrined the sovereignty of Parliament as an institution
- Statute made by Parliament became the highest form of law. 

#### Evolution of Parliamentary authority

- The shift to a constitutional monarchy was gradual
- In the 19th Century, monarchs continued to have considerable constitutional power, and the country remained an oligarchy
- Three electoral reform acts in the 1800s. In 1928 all men and women over 21 could vote equally.
- Doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty usually associated with Professor Dicey's writings in 1880s. 

## Dicey's theory

In Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (1885), Dicey stated:

> 'The principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty means nothing more or less than this, namely Parliament thus defined has, under the English Constitution, the right to make or unmake any law whatsoever; and, further, that no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.'

Key elements:
1. Parliament is the supreme law-making body
2. No parliament may be bound by a predecessor or may bind a successor
3. No person or body may question the validity of an enactment of Parliament
	

#### Supreme law-making body

- No substantive legal limitations on the legislation that Parliament may enact. 
- Parliament can pass legislation that affects or alters part of the constitution
- e.g., in [[ex parte Canon Selwyn (1872) 36 JP 54]] the court dismissed a challenge to the validity of the Irish Church Act 1869, based on an argument that it was contrary to the Act of Union with Ireland (1800).
- Parliament can legislate contrary to fundamental rights (though note the effect of HRA 2000)
- See also [[R v SoS Home Department ex parte Simms [2000] ]] and 'legality principle'
- Parliament can legislate contrary to international law: in cases such as [[Mortensen v Peters (1906) 8 F (J) 93]] and [[Cheney v Conn [1968] 1 All ER 779]] UK courts have clearly enforced UK statute rather than international law. 
- Legislation can also be passed with retrospective effect, such as the War Damages Act 1965 and War Crimes Act 1991. Note, this is often not seen as desirable in rule of law terms. 

#### No entrenchment

This is in contrary to the vast majority of other democratic states. In the UK, the constitution can potentially be drastically changed by a single Act of Parliament. This could happen through new law or repeal of existing law. Repeal can take an express or implied form. 


##### Express repeal

This occurs when legislation is passed that expressly states an intention that an earlier Act should be replaced.  For example, the Interception of Communications Act 1985 was expressly repealed and replaced by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.

Express repeal often happens when there is a drive to consolidate and simplify legislation. 

##### Implied repeal

This comes about if a new Act is partially or wholly inconsistent with a previous Act. Then the previous Act is repealed to the extent of the inconsistency. Parliament is deemed to have implicitly intended for the later Act to replace the earlier one. 

This implication will only be drawn by the courts where two statutes are **irreconcilable** (so an indirect inconsistency will not be enough).

##### Effect of implied repeal

Parliament cannot bind its successors to prevent a statute from being impliedly repealed by a later one which is incompatible with it. 

This is a reflection of the traditional view that sovereignty takes a 'continuing' form, and each new Parliament with a fresh mandate should have equal freedom to manoeuvre in creating new legislation. 

Theory born out of [[Vauxhall Estates v Liverpool Corporation [1932] 1 KB 133]] and [[Ellen St Estates v Minister of Health [1934] 1 KB 590]], both involving compensation for landowners whose property had been compulsorily purchased under legislation passed after WW1. 

The defendants in both cases were told that their compensation would be assessed according to the terms of the Housing Act 1925, rather than the more generous terms of the Acquisition of Land Act 1919. The 1919 Act had expressly stipulated that its provisions were to prevail over any other statutes (thereby trying to prevent future implied repeal).

The courts denied that the 1919 Act was intended to have that effect. Significantly, they added that even if this had been the intention, the 1919 Act still could not have prevented the 1925 Act from impliedly repealing it, as Parliament is not able to bind its successors.

#### Validity of Acts of Parliament

Follows naturally from the first limb of Dicey's theory: that law created by Parliament is supreme. 

UK courts are not able to quash or invalidate primary legislation, unlike the situation in other countries. 

The Diceyan theory does not allow for judicial review of any alleged precedural irregularity in the way that state had gone through the legislative process.

## Enrolled Bill rule

If a Bill has been enrolled (has become an Act of Parliament), then any departure from normal procedure during the passage of the bill cannot be corrected by the courts. 

Significant in two cases: [[Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway v Wauchope (1842) 8 ER 279 (HL)]] and [[Pickin v British Railways Board [1974] AC 765]]. Lord Morris:
> 'When an enactment is passed there is finality unless and until it is amended or repealed by Parliament. In the courts there may be argument as to the correct interpretation of the enactment: there must be none as to whether it should be on the Statute Book at all.'

## Character of the constitution

The Supreme authority of statute law and apparent impossibility of entrenchment of constitutional basics means that the UK has a potentially highly flexible constitution. It enhances the broadly political character of the UK constitution, in which political drivers tend to be more significant than fundamental constitutional rules. 

Note that Dicey's theory essentially implies that the monarch is at the heart of all decisions. When we talk of 'Parliamentary sovereignty' this refers to the Commons, Lords and Monarch, who collectively create and assent to legislation. 

## Limitations on Parliamentary sovereignty

#### Context

The essence of Dicey's theory is giving the Westminster Parliament unlimited legal powers. So substantive or procedural limitations can in theory apply to its powers. 

But since Dicey, a number of legal and constitutional developments have taken place, arguably diluting the purity of the Diceyan doctrine. The subject area remains contraversial and politically contentious. 

#### Procedural limitations

One issue: is it possible for Parliament to introduce procedural requirements to make it harder for subsequent parliaments to change the law (e.g., requiring prior popular approval for repeal in a referendum). Known as **entrenchment 'by manner and form'.**

Orthodox view: while a parliament could pass a statute requiring a special procedure for its amendment or repeal, this requirement would not be binding on a successor parliament. And the courts would not consider a challenge to the subsequent incompatible statute because of the 'enrolled bill rule' laid down in [[Pickin v British Railways Board [1974] AC 765]]. 

#### Commonwealth cases

Academic argument over this issue, inspired by [[Privy Council case of Attorney General for New South Wales v Trethowan [1932] AC 526]]

Critics argue that the New South Wales legislature was a creation of the UK Parliament, so was subordinate to it. It was not a sovereign legislature, so had a different legal position. The position of manner and form entrenchment only seemed to therefore apply to subordinate legislatures. 

The [European Union Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/12/contents) introduced a 'referendum lock'; a statutory framework requiring a referendum to be held before further amendments could be made to the founding Treaties of the EU. This seemed to extend the pledge beyond the life of that Parliament, by creating a manner and form requirement. 

Debate over the possibility of procedural limitations on Parliament's powers has continued in some orbiter discussions in the higher courts:
- In [[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin)]], Laws LJ said 
	> “Parliament… cannot stipulate as to the manner and form of any subsequent legislation”.
- Lady Hale in [[Jackson v Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56]]:

	> 'If the sovereign Parliament can redefine itself downwards, to remove or modify the requirement for the consent of the Upper House, [i.e. via the Parliament Acts] it may very well be that it can also redefine itself upwards, to require a particular parliamentary majority or a popular referendum for particular types of measure. In each case, the courts would be respecting the will of the sovereign Parliament as constituted when that will had been expressed'.

#### Legislative independence

One of the most notable historical challenges to the notion of Westminster omnipotence has been ending of Empire and erosion of the Union. 

##### Scottish perspective

The conception of the powers of Westminster in Scotland have always been different to those held in England and Wales. Approach taken by Scottish judiciary in [[MacCormick v Lord Advocate [1953] SC 396]].

Scottish theory: Acts of Union were not created by the UK Parliament, but by the original English, Scottish and Irish Parliaments. So the Acts created a new UK Parliament that did not have unlimited sovereignty, but was limited by its founding constitutional documents. 

Professor J. Mitchell: the new Parliament was 'born unfree'.

##### Dominions

Dominion statutes was given to recognise a number of semi-independent states under the British Empire:
- Canada (1867)
- Australia (1901)
- New Zealand (1907)
- Irish Free State (1922)

The Dominions' constitutions were established by UK Acts of Parliament. A constitutional convention developed that no new UK Act affecting a Dominion would be passed without the request and consent of that Dominion. This was confirmed in s 4 of the Statute of Westminster 1931. 

This caused significant conceptual challenges to the original Diceyan doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. The Westminster Parliament had effectively legislated to reduce its own sphere of political authority. 

Some judges: political change has not diminished the unlimited legal authority of Parliament (Megarry VC in [[Manuel v Attorney General [1983] Ch 77]]). 

Others: political and legal authority operate on entirely different planes. Lord Denning in [[Blackburn v Attorney General [1971] 1 WLR 1307]]:

> 'We have all been brought up to believe that, in legal theory, one parliament cannot bind another and that no act is irreversible. But legal theory does not always march alongside political reality. Take the Statute of Westminster 1931 … Can anyone imagine that Parliament could or would reverse that statute? Take the Acts which have granted independence to the Dominions….Can anyone imagine that parliament could or would reverse those laws and take away their independence? Most clearly not. Freedom once given cannot be taken away. Legal theory must give way to practical politics.'

## Impact of devolution

In the past, autonomous powers given by Westminster have been suspended or taken away:
- 'Direct rule' from Westminster was imposed on Northern Ireland from 1972-1988, after the province had been run by its own government in Stormont from 1921. 
- Significant layers of local government have also been abolished: Thatcher's abolition of Greater London Council in 1986.

But political acceptance of devolution in Scotland and Wales makes it difficult to see how original devolution could be reversed. This is a political limitation on authority of Westminster parliament rather than a legal one, but practically takes the orthodox theory into abstract terms (i.e., who cares). 

## Entrenchment

> [!info]
> Notes from "Entrenchment in the United Kingdom" by Dr Andrew Blick

All legal systems have hierarchies. If a court finds that two rules are in conflict with one another, it must have a means of discerning which should take precedence over the other. Possible solutions:
1. State that the more recent provision overrides the other
2. Consider the authority under which both precedents were issued, e.g., consider whether the particular policy area concerned is within the state or federal legislature. This is what is happening with devolved legislatures. 
3. Consider the procedure by which each rule was introduced: whether the rule should be subject to implied or only express appeal. 
4. Certain legal rules could be protected permanently with a written constitution. 

Common law constitutionalism refers to a school of thought saying that certain common law principles such as the prohibition of torture are so fundamental as to be beyond the reach of legislators. 

#### Parliamentary sovereignty revisited

Orthodox interpretation of parliamentary sovereignty:
- Parliament could legislate in contravention to international law
- It could (if using express terms) directly contravene European law, and the European Convention on Human Rights
- It could legislate in policy areas devolved to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
- It could abolish devolved administrations altogether
- Can create delegated powers enabling ministers to amend or repeal Acts of Parliament, without need to resort to full parliamentary procedures required to pass an Act (though potentially subject to judicial review)
- Act can seek to preclude judicial review of powers it creates

The legal system exists in a permanent present. In such a system, it is difficult to provide firm expression to a principle that some rules of a systemic nature are more important than others, and so changes to those rules should command a wider consensus. Danger that a government might seek to deploy its dominant position within the UK legislature to alter the rules in pursuit of partisan gain. 

A modern democracy is sophisticated: while elections and the concept of decision-making on the basis of majority votes are important, they are not the whole: certain principles like the rule of law and human rights must also be respected. Populist majoritarianism could be deployed even to destroy processes like multi-party elections. 

#### Checks and balances

##### Cricket

One supposed safeguard is the sound judgement and good intentions of legislators. But the executive sits in Parliament, usually with a Parliamentary majority...

##### Lords

House of Lords does on some accounts perform a role of constitutional guardianship. Parliamentary committees such as the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution operate in this area. 

##### Politics

Practical and policy limitations: but these safeguards are arbitrary. Consider Human Rights being contaminated in the public perception: populists hope to use this to exert pressure on Parliament, challenging its potential to act as an upholder of standards. 

##### Conventions

Conventions: force is derived from them being recognised as binding by the different players involved in the political process. Public scrutiny can be important. No doubt that these can be effective: think about monarch's legal rights under the royal prerogative. Arguably a convention that certain types of constitutional decision making require approval by referendum. 

But self-imposed conventions come with problems: there is not necessarily a satisfactory means of impartial arbitration if a dispute arises involving a convention. Danger of abuse of power. 

Conventions have broken down in the past: 
- Dispute over how the House of Lords could utilise its legal right to veto legislation including finance bills led to the Parliament Act 1911. 
- The coalition government's decision to seek to legislate for changes in the system of party funding without achieving cross-party consensus for these proposals
- Introduction of directly elected devolved mayors in England without first holding referendums in the areas concerned. 

Publication of official documents containing in them accounts of conventions. Could be seen as helpfully clarifying, or increasing the chances that conventions will be acknowledged and upheld. But equally, could be evidence of a prior loss of faith in the effectiveness of conventions as tools of constitutional management. 

##### Legal entrenchment

1. Treaty and Acts of Union between Scotland and England: text appears to be self-entrenching. Parliament probably cannot interfere with an instrument in which its own authority is founded? Notable that it is generally accepted that a referendum is required for a break-up of the union. Doubtful that a court would stand in the way of full repeal. But these documents are not legally entrenched in this modern sense. 
2. Parliament Act 1911, as amended by Parliament Act 1949, provides for an inverted form of entrenchment. Made it easier for Parliament to legislate in most possible ways through creating a mechanism for the House of Commons to have the last word in a dispute with the House of Lords. But some bills are exempt from this process, such as that extending the life of a Parliament beyond 5 years. So in that sense maximum duration of Parliament is entrenched, since it is subject to the same protection of a potential Lords veto that once applied to all legislation. But the Commons could attempt to force through an amendment to this stipulation using the Parliament Acts themselves and then unilaterally postpone a General Election...
3. Fixed-term Parliaments Act: provides for early general elections following support from 2/3 or more of MPs  

#### Judicial review

The tendency for inclusion of conventions in published official codes may serve to make their justiciability more likely. But the idea that a court may void an Act of Parliament on the grounds that it conflicted with a fundamental constitutional principle is less plausible. 

Courts also play an adjudicatory role in another form of entrenchment, whereby in limited areas the doctrine of implied repeal does not apply - constitutionally important statutes, such as the Human Rights Act 1998. HRA is the closest equivalent to a 'Bill of Rights' that the UK possesses. 

European Communities Act 1972: courts could disapply Acts that are not compatible with European Law. This is the closest UK has come to constitutional review. Poses a greater legal challenge to parliamentary sovereignty than any other practice in the UK constitution. So this entrenchment has ended. Other challenges to parliamentary supremacy could manifest themselves in the future?

Some members of the judiciary have expressed a view that parliamentary sovereignty derives its force from common law (common law constitutionalism). Might decide that certain enactments are of a constitutional nature, and should be subject only to express amendment or repeal. Theory would seem to imply the courts reading an implicit intention into some intention. 

Extreme form: $\exists$ certain constitutional principles so fundamental that a court should refuse to recognise any attempt by Parliament to abrogate them. These could include the abolition of judicial review or the mandating of torture. Potentially also an attempt to bypass Parliament Act precaution against extensions, and using the same power to prolong a Parliament. Would amount to a constitutional crisis. 

There is a new common understanding that the written constitution is the ultimate source of authority. 

Some supporters of the use of popular votes have regarded them as a means of bringing about sweeping changes that might otherwise not been attainable: they are a means of driving change. But do referendums circumvent other entrenchment mechanisms?

#### Future entrenchment options

- New Zealand model
- Process of Parliament itself identifying legislation of constitutional significance
- Changes to the Standing Orders of one or both Houses of Parliament to establish procedures like supermajority requirements entrenching legislative provisions. But any change would be vulnerable to being overturned by a simple majority
- Added protected provisions in the Parliament Act. But vulnerable to reversal by a determined House of Commons
- Protection from implied repeal, with judiciary playing an enforcement role
- Self entrenchment, like how the Scotland Act requires a referendum to abolish Scottish Parliament and Government
- Rely on common law protections (excessive judicial discretion, invites constitutional conflict)
- New 'rule of recognition', supplanting notions of parliamentary sovereignty. Maybe some sort of convention separate from Parliament.
