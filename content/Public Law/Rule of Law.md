## Definition

The rule of law has become a more significant and constitutionally important concept in recent years: referred to as a 'constitutional principle' in s 1 [Constitutional Reform Act 2005](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/contents). The term is not defined in the Act, which was left to judges to interpret in each case. 

Lord Bingham:
> 'The core of the existing principle is that all persons and authorities within the state, whether public or private, should be bound by and entitled to the benefit of laws publicly made, taking effect (generally) in the future and publicly administered in the courts.'

## Schools of thought

#### Formal

Promoted by academics including Joseph Raz. Principles:

- Legal procedure must be clear and certain.
- The law must be prospective (i.e., law should not be applicable retrospectively).
- The law must be clear.
- It must be applied equally
- The judiciary must be independent.
	- The doctrine of the separation of powers is intrinsic to the rule of law, because the principle requires that the executive is prevented from exercising its power arbitrarily.

#### Substantive

- The same components as above, but a moral component is also necessary
- Without respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, a rule of law society cannot be said to exist
- e.g., Ronald Dworkin

## Aspects

In his book, '_The Rule of Law_', Lord Bingham, drawing on the work of Professor A.V. Dicey (from the late 19th century), set out eight fundamental principles. In his view these made up what, in liberal democracies, is recognised to be the 'rule of law':

1. The law should be accessible, clear, and predictable.
2. Legal issues should ordinarily be resolved through legal processes and not through the exercise of administrative discretion by government officials.
3. The law should apply equally to all.
4. The law should afford adequate protection for human rights.
5. There should be access to justice in the courts without inordinate delay or expense.
6. Public officials, including ministers, should exercise the powers they have been granted in good faith and within the limits of those powers.
7. Legal and adjudicative processes should be fair.
8. The state should comply with its obligations under international law.

This is a substantive view of the rule of law. 

#### Legality

The government must act 'in accordance with the law'. This means:

- Any government interference with persons or property must be sanctioned by a legal authority (whether in statute or the common law), giving an identifiable power to perform the action in question — this power must be exercised in a lawful manner ([[Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029]]).
- The presumption, when interpreting statutes, is that Parliament cannot be seen to have intended to restrict important rights and freedoms unless this is made clear. This has come to be known as the **legality principle** — ex p Simms.
- Many public (governmental) bodies are incorporated by statute, and so statutory provisions will define and limit their legal capacities.
- The independence of the judiciary is essential in this respect, because the courts determine whether government power is lawfully exercised, i.e., has been exercised within the powers given to it.

#### Judicial Review

The mechanism by which the rule of law is protected, and arbitrary use of government power protected. Administrative Courts determine whether an action was lawful, accorded to powers granted and rights protected by legislation. 

- The court cannot review primary legislation, but can assess whether any public body has complied with the provisions of the Act.            
- The court can review the legality of delegated legislation.
- The court can assess whether the government has breached a common law constitutional right, or lawfully exercised a prerogative power. 

#### Parliamentary sovereignty

Check on executive power, requires that executive only acts on lawful authority granted by Parliament. Sharp distinction between the British political system and systems of other countries.

There is an inherent tension between the principles of the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty because the latter, dominant principle permits Parliament to pass any law that it wishes to do so, including those that may undermine rule of law values.

- The judiciary uses rule of law to restrict the effect of legislation created by Parliament to protect individual rights and liberties. 
- In [[R v SoS Home Department ex parte Simms [2000] ]], Lord Hoffmann observed, as part of his legality principle, that Parliament could, if it wished, enact laws which undermine rights, but the language of the legislation must be completely clear:
> “Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual."

- See the Supreme Court judgment on the Black Spider Memos for more on this ambiguity. 

#### Legal certainty

Legislation should be clearly drafted. Lord Bingham identifies the “_torrent of legislation_”, particularly in the criminal field, as being a concern from the perspective of the rule of law. Quotes a judge describing the Criminal Justice Act 2003 as “deeply confusing” and writes: “legislation of this kind poses real problems of assimilation and comprehension, even to senior and seasoned professionals”.

In general, legislation should apply to future acts and not retrospectively. Retrospectively applicable legislation is sometimes passed when Parliament legislate to overturn decisions of the courts or give statutory effect to accepted procedure. 

Example of retrospective legislation | Details
---|---
[War Damage Act 1965](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1965/18) | Overrode the judgment of the House of Lords in [[Burmah Oil Company (Burma Trading) Ltd. v Lord Advocate [1965] AC 75]]. Therefore, the govt was not obliged to pay damages for property destroyed or damaged in the war, as the court had previously ordered.
[War Crimes Act 1991](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/13) | Empowered the UK courts to punish war crimes committed by persons who were not subject to British jurisdiction at the time when the crimes were committed, namely during World War Two.
[Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/17/contents) | Overrode the judgment of the Supreme Court in [[R (Reilly) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2013] UKSC 68]] which had required the Department of Work and Pensions to pay a rebate to claimants whose Jobseekers' Allowance had been withdrawn, when they refused to take part in an unpaid back-to-work training scheme.


## Authority for government power

- Courts: review determines if an executive power exists or not ([[Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029]])
- Other limitations can apply to the need for governmental bodies to use their power for their intended purpose ([[R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings [1995] 1 WLR 1037]])

#### Discretionary power

- Legislation should not be super restrictive: should not aim to prescribe a single lawful course of action in every situation
- So often confers a 'discretion' to courts to build in some flexibility. Discretionary power has greatly increased since ww2
- Dicey and Rule of Law thinkers have a natural suspicion of discretionary power, because of potential for abuse and arbitrary decision-making
- Judicial review comes in here: controls the exercise of discretionary power granted by legislation and can put decision-makers to the test about whether discretion was exercised properly

#### Changing attitudes to discretionary power

The willingness of the judiciary to intervene in the government's exercise of its statutory discretionary power increased considerably in the second half of the twentieth century:

- [[Liversidge v Anderson [1942] AC 206]] illustrates prevailing deferential judicial attitude at the time. All to do with the word reasonable
- [[IRC v Rossminster Ltd [1980] AC 952]] contradicted this earlier judgment

It has become very well established that the courts can quash decisions and actions taken by governmental bodies if they have taken these for purposes not specifically or, by implication, approved in the governing legislation. The 'Padfield principle' was established in [[Padfield v Ministry of Agriculture [1968] AC 997]]

## Tensions

Tensions between the Rule of Law and other aspects of the UK constitution are explored. 

#### Administrative discretion

Lord Bingham:

>“In practice, countless decisions are made every day by administrators charged with the duty of running our complex society, as, for example, on the allocation of housing to the homeless, the allocation of school places, the granting of planning permission, the granting of leave to enter the country, and so on.
>
>What matters is that the decisions should be made on stated criteria, that they should be amenable to legal challenge, although a challenge is unlikely to succeed if the decision was one legally and reasonably open to the decision-maker”.

It matters whether such decisions can be challenged. In many cases, due to the expense and risk of bringing claims in judicial review, they cannot be. 

#### Access to justice

Money is a barrier to accessing justice. Pro bono helps but only so much. The Government's legal aid budget cuts don't help → increase in the number of self-representing 'litigants in person'. Means that cases take longer and risk unjust outcomes. 

Other unwelcome developments include 'McKenzie Friends': non-legally qualified and unregulated advisors charging a fee for supporting someone in court. In 2019 the Chair of Parliament’s Justice select committee called for fee-charging McKenzie Friends to be banned after the High Court ruled that an unqualified “legal advisor" was negligent in his handling of a basic clinical negligence case. He had wrongly advised a 70-year-old claimant, who was left without evidence and subsequently faced with a five-figure legal costs claim.

#### Fees and costs

In civil courts, starting a case as a claimant costs money in court fees. Often the risk of having to pay a defendant's costs (if a claimant loses) deters people from pursuing long shot claims. 

In [[R (Unison) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51]] the Supreme Court found that the [Employment Tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal Fees Order 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2013/9780111538654/body) was unlawful under domestic and EU law for preventing access to justice. It asserted that the constitutional right of access to the courts was inherent in the rule of law. Courts existed to ensure the law was applied and enforced, which was valuable to society as a whole, not just the individuals involved.

#### Equality before the law

The Rule of Law requires that the law applies equally to everyone as far as possible. In the context of holding the Govt to account for its actions, there are exceptions:
- The monarch is, arguably, above the (criminal) law.
- Judges in higher courts are immune from civil litigation for acts done within their official jurisdiction.
- Parliamentary privilege — MPs cannot be sued for what they say in Parliament.
- Diplomatic immunity.
- Children are not subject to the same laws as adults.
- Are there now barriers to meaningful access to justice, caused by cuts to legal aid funding over the last decade or more?

Equality before the law qualified by Lord Bingham as “save to the extent that objective differences justify differentiation”. The differentiation must be relevant to the distinction, e.g., a non-British national can be deported, but a British national cannot. 

Not compatible with the Rule of Law to allow non-nationals suspected of international terrorism to be detained indefinitely without charge, but not apply the same restriction to nationals suspected of the same conduct (now-repealed [Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2001/24/contents)). 

#### Inequality of application

Schedule 7 of the [Terrorism Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/contents) is described by Liberty as a “breathtakingly broad and intrusive power to stop, search and hold individuals at ports, airports, and international rail stations”. The police, customs or immigration officer need not have any grounds for suspecting the person has any involvement in terrorism or any criminal activity at all. Under Schedule 7, the individual may be:

- Detained and questioned for up to nine hours.
-  Searched and have their belongings retained for up to seven days.
- The person has no right to a free legal representation while detained at the port or border, (unlike someone arrested and taken to a police station under normal police powers).
- It is a criminal offence if the person fails to answer questions or obstructs the exercise of the functions under the Act.
- If detained at a police station, officers can take the person’s biometric data – including fingerprints and DNA.

It is strongly arguable that the very wide discretion given to officers under Schedule 7 undermines the rule of law in its application, given that the powers are used disproportionately against particular racial groups.

#### Human Rights in the UK

The European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR') is the main source of human rights law in the UK. Incorporated into the domestic legal system by s 1 [Human Rights Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents). 

While HRA puts fundamental rights on a statutory footing and obliges public authorities to comply, there are long-standing equivalent rights under common law:
- the right to life
- the prohibition of torture
- no punishment without law
- right to freedom of expression
- right to public protest. 

The repeal of the Human Rights Act, possibly replaced by a British Bill of Rights would undermine the rule of law, for those subscribing to the substantive model. 

#### Unfair legal and adjudicative processes

Art 6 ECHR: right to a fair trial. This has been threatened by 
- UK signing up to 'fast-track' extradition treaties, preventing UK courts considering whether there is evidence justifying the extradition request. 
- Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) and other civil orders has blurred the line between criminal and civil law.
- Parallel system of secret courts and evidence to deal with those accused of terrorism. Hearings conducted under 'closed material procedure', allowing one party to present sensitive evidence to the judge which the other party cannot examine.
- Allows the court to appoint specially vetted counsel to communicate the interests of a party without risking the exposure of 'sensitive' national security details to that party.

#### Non-compliance with international law

International law contains generally agreed-upon standards of executive conduct. In June 2018, parliamentary Joint Intelligence and Security Committee (JISC) identified instances of government complicity in the unlawful treatment of detainees in its 'Report on Detainee Mistreatment and Rendition'. 

#### Government criticism of judges

The executive must respect the role of judges as the final arbiters of what the law means. But this has not always been respected: Boris Johnson said he 'profoundly disagrees' with UKSC's judgment in [[R (Miller) v Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41]] (Miller No. 2).

It is detrimental to the rule of law for government officials to express views on matters which are outside their constitutional remit. 

#### Further developments

The EU Withdrawal Act creates 'Henry VIII powers' allowing the government to change primary legislation by statutory instrument without recourse to Parliament. 

Oct 2019: one such SI was withdrawn following a legal challenge by the Public Law Project. This would have empowered officials to amend VAT on customs and excise law by public notice, rather than by law. 

Jo Hickman, PLP director:
> 'The use of public notices in this way has been likened to making law by proclamation, as in the time of Henry VIII. Introducing a power to change the law completely outside of the parliamentary process would set a dangerous and undemocratic precedent. The Statute of Proclamations 1539 was repealed after the death of Henry VIII for good reason.'

#### Automated decision-making

AI decision-making in public administration could undermine the principle of judicial transparency, accessibility and certainty. 

#### Parliamentary sovereignty

Remains the dominant constitutional principle in the UK. The judiciary upholds the rule of law in relation to the executive, but Parliament can pass any law it wishes. 

What would the courts do if Parliament passed an Act which fundamentally undermined the UK as a rule of law state? Addressed in [[Jackson v Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56]].

## Limits on executive power

Recall the requirement of legality: that government power can only be exercised on identifiable authority and in a lawful manner ([[Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029]]). There are two mechanisms for this restraint:
- Control by Parliament
	- Deciding whether government principles become law
	- Passing laws to give the executive powers within regulated restrictions
- Restraint by the courts
	- *Ultra vires* actions of executive are restrained by judicial review

#### Protection of Convention Rights

HRA is the principal source of protection against government interference with human rights. Redress can be sought in court, which will interpret UK law in a way which is compatible with convention rights. 

#### Proportionality

Some rights under the convention are absolute rights, which can never be restricted by the state; others are limited/ qualified. 

Qualified rights (e.g., privacy, freedom of expression) can be interfered with if there is a “legitimate aim” in restricting the right. Legitimate aims include protecting public safety, the prevention of crime, the protection of health, national security or the protection of other rights. 

The restriction is 'prescribed by' law and is necessary in a democratic society. It must be **proportionate** to the aim pursued. See [[Sunday Times v UK (1979-80) 2 EHRR 245]]. 

#### Derogation from Convention rights

The European Convention on Human Rights recognises that, in certain circumstances, member states may need to take measures which temporarily suspend certain human rights. Not all Convention rights can be derogated. 

Article 15 ECHR provides:
>“1. In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation any High Contracting Party may take measures derogating from its obligations under this Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.”

But such derogation can only be done in accordance with the law ([[A & Others v Secretary of State for Home Dept [2004] UKHL 56]] — Belmarsh case).

Such derogation must be both **reasonable** and **necessary**.

#### Constitutional statutes

Constitutional statutes are more difficult to repeal than ordinary legislation, and so afford an additional level of protection for constitutional rights.

Examples include:
- Bill of Rights, 1689; 
- Act of Settlement 1701
- Parliament Act 1911 
- Representation of the People Act 1918

and more recently:
- European Communities Act 1972
- Scotland Act 1998
- Constitutional Reform Act 2005

Constitutional statute defined in [[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin) 1]] by Laws LJ as a statute which
> 'conditioned the legal relationship between the citizen and state in some general, overarching manner, or enlarged or diminished the scope of what were regarded as fundamental, constitutional rights.'

The definition was further developed by Farrah Ahmed and Adam Perry in the Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol 37, Issue 2, Summer 2017, pp 461–481:

> "A constitutional statute is a statute at least a part of which
> (1) creates or regulates a state institution and
> (2) is among the most important elements of our government arrangements, in terms of (a) the influence it has on what state institutions can and may do, given our other governing norms, and (b) the influence it has on what state institutions can and may do through the difference it makes to our other norms.
> 
> Simplifying …, a constitutional statute is a statute that is about state institutions, and which substantially influences, … what those institutions can and may do."

#### Implied repeal

A doctrine saying that a new statute which is inconsistent with an existing statute will automatically supersede the existing law. An explicit provision to that effect (express repeal) is not needed. 

The doctrine of implied repeal does not apply to constitutional statutes. They may be repealed, but only by 
>“express words in a later statute or by words so specific that the inference of an actual determination [by Parliament] was irresistible.” 
>(Thoburn, per Laws LJ).

This was confirmed in [[H v Lord Advocate [2012] UKSC 24]] where the Supreme Court found that the Scotland Act 1998 is incapable of being altered other than by an express enactment. 

Observe that this is a soft restriction on executive power: to pass legislation inconsistent with the provisions of a constitutional statute, a government must confront the consequences, by making this very clear in the statutory language. 

The way in which constitutional statutes are interpreted nowadays by the courts has created some friction with the traditional principle of parliamentary sovereignty, as it is generally accepted that provisions in such legislation cannot be impliedly repealed.

#### Common law constitutionalism

Protection of important rights and freedoms comes from common law as well as statute. There has recently been a renaissance in the courts' attachment to using common law as a source of rights. 

Lord Toulson in [[Kennedy v. The Charity Commission [2014] UKSC 20]]:
> "What we now term human rights law and public law has developed through our common law over a long period of time. The process has quickened since the end of World War II in response to the growth of bureaucratic powers on the part of the state and the creation of multitudinous administrative agencies affecting many aspects of the citizen’s daily life.
> 
> The growth of the state has presented the courts with new challenges to which they have responded by a process of gradual adaption and development of the common law to meet current needs. This has always been the way of the common law and it has not ceased on the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998, although since then there has sometimes been a baleful and unnecessary tendency to overlook the common law. It needs to be emphasised that it was not the purpose of the Human Rights Act that the common law should become an ossuary."
