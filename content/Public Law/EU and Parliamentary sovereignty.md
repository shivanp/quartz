## UK as a dualist state

In the UK, domestic and international law obligations operate on different planes. Domestic law has a higher status in the UK legal system ([[Mortensen v Peters (1906) 8 F (J) 93]]) because it is created by the sovereign Parliament. 

If Parliament wishes international legal systems or standards to be enforced, these bodies of external law need to be first 'incorporated' into the UK legal system by passing a statute to this effect. 

This was done in 1972 with the passing of the European Communities Act, and in 1998 with the passing of the Human Rights Act, incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights. 

## EC/ EU Treaty obligations

The UK signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972 and became a full member of the European Communities from 01/01/73. To incorporate the Treaty of Rome 1957 into domestic law, Parliament passed ECA 1972. 

Note that Edward Heath signing the Treaty of Accession was a political commitment rather than a legal one; it was the implementation of the European Communities Act that really led to the incorporation of European Community law. 

A number of other treaties have since modified/ amended the original Treaty, including the Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union. These have been incorporated into UK law by statute amending the ECA.

Three key provisions relating to sovereignty:

Section | Effect
---|---
s 2(1) ECA 1972 | Gave effect to EU law within the UK. Provides that 'All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom, shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed, and followed accordingly…'
s 3(1) ECA 1972 | Provided that questions of law relating to the EU should be determined according to the principles laid down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This gave effect to the case law of that court (now the Court of Justice of the European Union — 'CJEU')

Most significant of all the principles of EU law that have been established — and one that was already laid down by the ECJ a decade before UK accession — was that of the supremacy of EU law over domestic law, (now known as the 'primacy' of EU law).

This principle was established in the case of [[Costa v E.N.E.L. (Case 6 of 64) [1964] ECR 585]]. It stipulates that EU law cannot be overridden by the national law of the Member States. In the event that the two are in conflict, EU law must prevail.

This contradicts the traditional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. 

s 2(4) ECA sought to accommodate the primacy of EU law more specifically. It provides that 

> '… any enactment passed or to be passed shall be construed and have effect subject to [EU Law].'

The application was straightforward in relation to any UK statutes enacted before ECA 1972: any pre-1972 statutes which were incompatible would be overridden by ECA itself. 

But s 2(4) ECA also required any statutes enacted after 1972 to have effect subject to EU law. This created a tension with the principle of parliamentary sovereignty as it appeared to run counter to the principle in [[Vauxhall Estates v Liverpool Corporation [1932] 1 KB 133]] and [[Ellen St Estates v Minister of Health [1934] 1 KB 590]] that Parliament cannot bind itself to prevent a later statute from impliedly repealing an earlier statute. 

Raised the question: did s 2(4) have the effect that EU law would override subsequent statutes?

## Primacy of EU law vs Parliamentary Sovereignty

#### Early cases

In early cases (1980s) mostly in relation to employment rights, courts managed to resolve issues by presuming that whenever it passed legislation, Parliament intended to comply with EU law. Any inconsistency between the two was put down to oversight of the draftsman ([[Macarthys Ltd v Smith [1979] All ER 325]]). The Court of Appeal accepted that by virtue of ss 2(1) and 2(4) ECA 1972, EU law would take precedence over the relevant statute, if it proved to be inconsistent with the statute. 

#### Factortame

This worked until 1990 and the [[Factortame]] dispute. Following the ECJ's response, law lords responded in [[R v Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Factortame Ltd. (No. 2) [1991] 1 AC 603]]. This is one of the most important cases in UK constitutional law. Established that the courts could now suspend an Act of Parliament where they were required to do so by EU law. 

Lord Bridge insisted that the principle of the supremacy of EU law was well established by the time that the UK had joined and that in enacting ECA 1972, Parliament had voluntarily signed up to a 'limitation' on its own sovereignty. 

Factortame put it beyond doubt that EU law could override or 'disapply' conflicting UK statutes enacted after 1972. Subsequent cases went further, disapplying provisions within statutes conflicting with EU law, even without reference to ECJ. 

#### Post-Factortame

The ability of courts to do this was highlighted in [[R v SoS Employment, ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1995] 1 AC 1]]. Case involved the rights of part-time workers under Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. 

[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin)]]: the 'metric martyrs' case. Laws LJ made orbiter comments for why the Diceyan doctrine of implied repeal no longer seemed to operate in relation to cases such as Factortame. 

He concluded that EU law was able to prevail over incompatible domestic statutes because an exception had been created to the doctrine of implied repeal.

Saw this to be a reflection of the existence of a hierarchy of statutes, which could be divided into 'ordinary' statutes and 'constitutional' statutes. 

Constitutional statutes included:
- ECA 1972
- HRA 1998
- Devolution Acts 1998
- Bill of Rights 1689
- Parliament Act 1911

This theory has been judicially approved elsewhere (e.g., [[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5]]). It clearly contradicts Dicey's view that all statutes have equal status.

## Brexit

Clear that the impact of the EU on parliamentary sovereignty was a significant but temporary one. Courts enforcing principles of EU law over domestic statutes shows that it is possible for one parliament (in 1972) to have bound future ones in a substantive way. But this only lasts as long as Parliament as a continuing institution wishes to be bound by it. 

So Parliament can impose limitations on itself, but it cannot prevent future parliaments from removing these restrictions.
