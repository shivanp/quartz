- Some ignored the [[Terms]] on which given land
- Common law courts did nothing

- Basis for modern law of trusts

## Equity became more popular

✔Greater flexibility
✔Broadly adhered to doctrine of precedent

Then in Earl of Oxford's Case (1615) Mich 13 Jac 1., King James I decided that equity should prevail over common law (but stressing that equity follows the law). 

But having two systems was a pain e.g. if an equitable remedy (like injunction) and damages both sought, two actions would have to be brought, one at common law and the other at Chancery. Judicature Acts 1873-75 abolished the division, creating single [[High Court]] and [[Court of Appeal]] to apply both common law and equity.

But the conceptual division in principle between common law rights and equitable (or beneficial) rights remains. [[Equitable remedies]] are still discretionary, whereas common law damages available as a right.
