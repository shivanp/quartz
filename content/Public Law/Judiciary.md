## Role of Judiciary

- To determine the outcome of legal disputes between individuals (natural or legal persons)
- Decide appropriate punishment in criminal cases
- Interpret proper meaning of legislation
- (for Administrative Court) to determine through judicial review whether the government has lawfully exercised its powers.
	- Appeals to this lie to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and then Supreme Court.

## Constitutional Reform Act 2005

Designed to address the separation of powers between the judiciary and other two bodies of state. Prior to 2005, Lord Chancellor was head of the judiciary, a government minister and also presiding officer in the chamber of the House of Lords. Until the 1990s, was also one of the 'law lords'. After the Act,
- Office of Lord Chancellor reformed, so judicial functions given to Lord Chief Justice
- Established Supreme Court as separate entity
- Created Judicial Appointments Commission for appointment of judges (previously appointed by Queen on 'advice' of Lord Chancellor)

#### Lord Chancellor

Lord Chancellor (appointed by PM via Queenie) now responsible for administration of the court system, and also holds post of Secretary of State for Justice. Statutory safeguards to prevent excessive influence by Lord Chancellor over judicial decision-making:
- LC has legal duty to uphold independence of judiciary (s3(1) CRA 2005)
- LC must not seek to influence particular judiciary decisions through any special access to judiciary (s 3(4) CRA)

Lord Chief Justice appointed by special panel convened by Judicial Appointments Commission. Role: Head of the Judiciary of England and Wales, and President of the Courts of England and Wales. Responsibilities include:
- Representing views of judiciary to Parliament and Govt
- Welfare, training and guidance of judiciary
- Deployment of judges and allocation of work in courts.

## Judiciary constitutional principles

Judges sworn in with two oaths:
- Allegiance to the sovereign
- Judicial oath: 
> I will do right by all manner of people after the laws and usages of this realm, without fear or favour, affection or ill will

Refers to judgement according to applicable law, and impartial and independent judgement. 

## Justiciability

Strong sensitivities over whether all Govt decisions are reviewable by the Administrative Court, or by a Tribunal with judicial review jurisdiction. Some Govt acts seen as non-justiciable (if purely political). In [[R (Miller) v Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41]] Court rejected Govt's argument that prorogation of Parliament was purely a political issue. 

Lady Hale on the Supreme Court:
> We have definitely become the guardians of the United Kingdom constitution

Reasons:
- Justices rule on validity of laws passed by devolved legislatures
- Restrict Govt to exercise of power within limits set by Parliament
- Protect fundamental rights of individuals against encroachment by the state

Note that the UK Supreme Court does not have 'strike down' powers over primary legislation passed by Parliament, so cannot directly judge the constitutionality of UK statutes.
