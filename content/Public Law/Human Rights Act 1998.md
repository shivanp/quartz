## Introduction

The [Human Rights Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents) (“HRA 1998”) came into force in England and Wales on 2 October 2000.

The Act incorporated most of the European Convention of Human Rights 1950 (“ECHR”) into UK domestic law. This meant that these rights could now be enforced by the UK courts.

#### Dualist system

The UK was one of the first signatories to the ECHR, having ratified it on March 1951. The ECHR came into force on 3 September 1953.

You will recall that the UK has a dualist system and therefore, international law can only be enforced against the UK state where either:

- A claim is made against it to an international court. Before the HRA 1998, persons wishing to enforce their rights under the ECHR against the UK had to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights (‘ECtHR’); or
- The UK has incorporated international law rules into its domestic law by passing a statute. If this is done, UK domestic courts are able, and duty-bound to enforce those rules. This has been the effect of the HRA 1998.


#### Rationale

The main function of the HRA was therefore to incorporate the body of law in the ECHR into UK law so that the standards and obligations within it could be enforced in our domestic courts. The HRA has therefore allowed for a more practical and efficient system of domestic rights protection, as well as creating a positive statement of values as a key part of the UK’s constitution.

The HRA was also important in remedying some of the perceived downsides of the previous system, where victims of human rights abuses had to apply to the ECtHR in Strasbourg, often after long delays. Until the 1990s, the UK was one of the leading states against which ECHR violations were found.

Though the UK had a good record in following judgments of the Strasbourg court, the process was nevertheless embarrassing politically – it was described as “washing our dirty linen in public”.

#### Structure

As we examine sections of the HRA 1998, we will also refer to provisions of the ECHR. It is therefore important to note where key ECHR provisions can be found. The ECHR is divided into three sections.

| Article        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Article 1      | The ECHR seeks to protect civil and political rights, as well as a limited number of social rights, by requiring that all contracting states to the ECHR must 'secure to everyone within their jurisdiction' the rights and freedoms defined in the ECHR. |
| Articles 2-14  | Lists those rights and freedoms (see below).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Article 15     | Applies to derogations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Article 57     | Applies to reservations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Articles 19-57 | Outline the procedural aspects of the operation of the ECHR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Protected ECHR rights

The protected ECHR rights, which the HRA has incorporated into UK law, can be divided into three main categories. (The substance of several of these rights will be considered in more detail in later topics).

These are rights that cannot be legitimately interfered with by the state.

#### Absolute rights

| Right     | Description                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Article 3 | Prohibition on torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.                  |
| Article 4 | Prohibition on slavery and forced labour; (it applies in relation to human trafficking.) |
| Article 7 | Provides that there shall be no punishment without lawful authority, with particular regard to retrospective criminalisation and punishment.                                                                                         |

#### Limited rights

| Rights    | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Article 2 | The right to life                          |
| Article 5 | The right to liberty and security of person |
| Article 6 | The right to a fair trial and fair legal process                                           |

#### Qualified rights

Within articles containing qualified rights, the first paragraph sets out the substantive right(s) and the second paragraph lists the circumstances and methodology by which the rights may be lawfully interfered with by the state. The qualified rights are set out on the next slide.

| Rights     | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Article 8  | Right to respect for private and family life |
| Article 9  | Freedom of thought, conscience and religion  |
| Article 10 | Freedom of expression                        |
| Article 11 | Freedom of assembly and association.                                             |


Generally, for the state to interfere legitimately with a qualified ECHR right, it must be shown that all three of the following requirements are met. They are contained in subsection (2) of each article:
(a) The interference was prescribed by, or in accordance with, the law.
(b) The interference was in pursuit of a legitimate aim.
(c) The interference was necessary in a democratic society (i.e., proportionate).

## Judicial principles

When the UK courts enforce the protections within the ECHR, through mechanisms provided by the HRA, they will necessarily make judgments about the correct interpretation of those protections. In so doing, the UK courts have a duty to ‘take into account’ relevant ECtHR case law as per s. 2 HRA 1998.

It is important, therefore, to consider some of the key principles and techniques developed by the ECtHR, which the UK courts consider and sometimes incorporate and develop (where relevant) in the domestic context.

#### Positive obligation

The primary obligation on states under the ECHR is a negative one, meaning that the state is required to abstain from interfering with a human right.

The concept of the positive obligation upon states was developed by the ECtHR in response to situations where the violating activity has been committed or could be committed not by the state, but by private individuals.

Under this principle, the state can, in certain circumstances, be under a duty to prevent the violation of human rights being carried out by the relevant non-state actors.

There are a variety of ways in which positive obligations upon the state can arise. One way in which a positive obligation may need to be fulfilled is by contracting states enacting laws in their domestic legal systems that prohibit, deter, and punish individuals who commit Convention violations.

An example of this is provided by [[X and Y v The Netherlands [1985] 8 EHRR 235]], where the lack of a specific criminal sanction in Dutch law allowed a man to evade conviction for the sexual assault of a girl with learning difficulties. The respondent state was held to have breached its positive obligation under article 8.

In  [[Osman v UK (2000) 29 EHRR 245]] it was held that the positive obligation on the state was for its authorities (in this case the police) to take preventative measures to protect an individual whose life was at risk from the criminal acts of another private individual. However, the court stated that this obligation on the authorities was subject to the following conditions:

> '[I]t must be established … that the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.’

The same issues were reflected again in the context of healthcare in the case of [[Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Trust [2012] UKSC 2]]. 

#### Margin of appreciation

The 'margin of appreciation' doctrine reflects the subsidiary role of the ECHR in protecting human rights. The overall scheme of the Convention is that the initial and primary responsibility for the protection of human rights lies with the contracting states parties themselves.

Contracting states are therefore allowed a certain measure of discretion when taking legislative, administrative, or judicial measures that restrict ECHR rights. The doctrine is based on the assumption that contracting states have a better knowledge of the political, social, and cultural traditions that influence their countries than the ECtHR does, and that this should be respected. Nevertheless, the exercise of state discretion is not unlimited; it is still subject to ultimate supervision by the ECtHR.

In [[Handyside v UK (1976) 1 EHRR 737]], which concerned an interference with freedom of expression under article 10(1), the ECtHR explained that:
> 'By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of those requirements [of morality] as well as on the “necessity” of a “restriction” or “penalty” intended to meet them …
> 
> Nevertheless, Article 10(2) does not give the Contracting States an unlimited power of appreciation. The court, which, with the Commission, is responsible for ensuring the observance of those States' engagements, is empowered to give the final ruling on whether a “restriction” or “penalty” is reconcilable with freedom of expression as protected by Article 10. The domestic margin of appreciation thus goes hand in hand with a European supervision.'

#### Application of the margin of appreciation

Areas where ECtHR affords the state a broader discretion

Decisions concerning:
- Morality and religion
- Public emergency
- National security
- Social, economic and environmental policies

Areas where less discretion is afforded to the state is where individual rights are affected. For example:
- A person’s existence or identity
- A person’s liberty
- Legal rights.


> [!note]
> The margin of appreciation, strictly defined, only applies to ECtHR cases. It will not apply to domestic UK cases, as these are being decided by a home court and not an international, supervisory one.
#### Principle of proportionality

In [[Soering v UK (1989) 11 EHRR 439]], the ECtHR said:
> '[I]nherent in the whole of the Convention is a search for a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights.’

Proportionality is a key principle of ECHR law. It is a standard that is expressly contained in the qualified rights in articles 8 to 11. It also features as the standard within the test for limiting the right to life in article 2, and it has been interpreted as the correct standard applying to limitations on other articles such as article 6.

The principle of proportionality is multi-faceted, and the ECtHR employs slightly different variations of the test with respect to the articles when considering whether a fair balance has been struck by the state between the general community interests on the one hand, and the protection of individuals' human rights on the other. Proportionality will be discussed further in the context of the individual articles.

## Obligations

The HRA 1998 created four key new obligations that have had a very significant impact on UK domestic law. These obligations are:

| Section    | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s 2 HRA    | In determining legal questions, including common law development, the courts must take into account relevant ECHR case law.     |
| s 3 HRA    | Legislation must be read and given effect (by the courts), so far as is possible, in a way that is compatible with ECHR rights. |
| s 4 HRA    | If the above (s. 3) is not possible, the court may make a declaration of incompatibility.                                       |
| s 6(1) HRA | It is unlawful for 'public authorities' (including courts and tribunals) to act in a way that is incompatible with Convention rights.                                                                                                                                |


#### s 2 HRA: ECHR decisions

Section 2(1) HRA states that:
> ‘A court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account any (a) judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights…’

The first case to consider the meaning and extent of s. 2(1) was [[R (Alconbury Developments Ltd) v Secretary of State for the Environment [2001] UKHL 23]], where the House of Lords held that, while the case law of the ECtHR is not binding, domestic courts should follow any clear and consistent jurisprudence unless there are special circumstances, or the decisions of the ECtHR would compel a conclusion fundamentally at odds with the UK constitution.

This was followed by [[R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator [2004] UKHL 26]], in which Lord Bingham stated: 
> “The duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less”.

This approach was sometimes called the ‘mirror principle’.

See [[Human rights]]. 

#### Departure from mirror principle

[[R v Spear [2002] UKHL 31]] was the first decision in which the House of Lords declined to follow the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, in relation to the question of whether UK military court-martials’ procedure was compliant with article 6.

The decision in [[R v Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14]] (which also related to article 6) also illustrates a departure from previous Strasbourg case law. In it, Lord Phillips made the following comments about the HRA 1998, s. 2(1):
> ‘There will, however, be rare occasions where this court has concerns as to whether a decision of the Strasbourg Court sufficiently appreciates or accommodates particular aspects of our domestic process. In such circumstances it is open to this court to decline to follow the Strasbourg decision, giving reasons for adopting this course. This is likely to give the Strasbourg Court the opportunity to reconsider the particular aspect of the decision that is in issue, so that there takes place what may prove to be a valuable dialogue between this court and the Strasbourg Court’.

#### Mirror to dialogue

In recent years the relationship between the UK courts and the ECtHR has increasingly been described as one involving 'dialogue', following Lord Phillips’ words in Horncastle.

UK judges and academics have argued that legal reasoning on ECHR issues in UK courts should have an influence in Strasbourg. In other words, the process should not apply in one direction only ([[Animal Defenders International v UK [2013] EMLR 28]], [[R (Hicks) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2014] EWCA Civ 3]]). 

In a joint judgment in the case of [[R (Haney) v SoS for Justice [2014] UKSC 66]], Lords Mance and Hughes boldly set out what can be understood as the current position of the UK courts regarding s. 2(1):
> “…Usually, domestic and Strasbourg jurisprudence march hand in hand, as contemplated by the “mirror” principle… More radically, the domestic court may conclude that such Strasbourg authority as exists cannot be supported and may decline to follow it in the hope that it may be reconsidered: R v Horncastle …”

#### s 6 HRA: public authorities

> [!statute]
> 
> (1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.
> 
> …
> 
> (3) In this section “public authority” includes-
> (a) a court or tribunal, and
> (b) any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature…
> 
> …
> 
> (5) In relation to a particular act, a person is not a public authority by virtue only of subsection (3)(b) if the nature of the act is private.
##### What is a public authority

As s. 6(1) imposes legal duties only on a 'public authority', it is important to know which bodies fall into that category. This has caused some difficulty as the concept of 'public authority' is not specifically defined in the HRA.

One body/group of persons is however, expressly excluded: the Westminster Parliament in its legislative roles and any person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament. This exclusion is designed to protect parliamentary privilege and sovereignty.

Section 6 effectively recognises three types of bodies: ‘core’ public authorities (s. 6(1)); ‘hybrid’ or ‘functional’ public authorities (s. 6(3)(b)); and private bodies (s. 6(5)). (No liability at all under s. 6 HRA falls on the third category).

#### Core public authorities

Core public authorities are bodies that are clearly, and inherently by their very nature, public authorities. They are potentially subject to the s. 6(1) obligation in respect of all their actions.

These authorities include, for example: central government departments; local authorities; the police; and the Inland Revenue (now HMRC). As to the question of determining whether a body is a core public authority, there is no definitive test. However, The White Paper, 'Rights Brought Home', presenting the Human Rights Bill in October 1997, set out a list of those that would be included, and some broader guidance. In Chapter 2.2 the paper stated that:
> 'Examples of persons or organisations whose acts or omissions it is intended should be able to be challenged include central government (including executive agencies); local government; the police; immigration officers; prisons; courts and tribunals themselves...'

As the White Paper did not provide a definitive list of core public authorities, determining this question has fallen to the courts. In the leading case of [[Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank [2003] UKHL 37]] the House of Lords issued guidance on what constituted the scope of the concept of a core public authority.

Lord Nicholls (para 7) suggested that the phrase 'public authority' is 'essentially a reference to a body whose nature is governmental in a broad sense. He further suggested that the following factors could be considered relevant in determining whether a body is a 'core' public authority:
(a) the possession of special powers
(b) democratic accountability
(c) public funding in whole or in part
(d) an obligation to act only in the public interest
(e) a statutory constitution.

#### Functional or hybrid public authorities

The notion of a ‘functional’ or ‘hybrid’ public authority (these terms are used interchangeably) originates in s. 6(3)(b), HRA 1998 which provides that the term ‘public authority’ includes ‘any person certain of whose functions are functions of a ‘public nature’.

These are distinguished from those acts performed by such bodies that are of a 'private nature': s. 6(5) HRA. A body which may be private in nature, but which is performing a function of a public nature may be liable under the HRA in respect of that particular public function. This issue has tended to arise in practice in relation to bodies such as housing associations and care homes, where provision of social and care services has been outsourced.

In [[Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley Parochial Church Council v Wallbank [2003] UKHL 37]] the House of Lords addressed the questions of core and functional public authorities.

The House of Lords stressed that it was the **nature of the function** being performed that should determine whether a body was a functional public authority. Lord Nicholls suggested that there should be a 'generously wide' interpretation of public function so as to further the statutory aim of promoting human rights protection. He stated (para 12) that the following factors may be relevant:

1. the extent to which, in carrying out the function, the body is **publicly funded**
2. exercising **statutory power**
3. **taking the place** of central government or local authorities
4. is providing a **public service**

[[Poplar Housing Association Ltd v Donoghue [2001] EWCA Civ 595]] preceded Aston Cantlow. One additional factor identified in Poplar, but not expressly discussed in Aston Cantlow, as relevant to assessing whether a function is public, was the **proximity** of the relationship between the private body and the delegating authority. In Poplar the housing association and the local authority, which had transferred its housing stock to the association, were described as ‘so closely enmeshed.’

In [[YL v Birmingham City Council [2007] UKHL 27]], the House of Lords held that privately run care homes for the elderly were not functional public authorities for the purposes of the HRA. Lord Scott stated that the care homes were owned by a private company, which entered into private law contracts with its residents and local authorities, and which received no public funding and enjoyed no special statutory powers. Note, however, the strong dissenting opinions in this case from Lord Bingham and Lady Hale in the minority.

Contrast YL with the less restrictive approach taken in [[R (Weaver) v London and Quadrant Housing Trust [2009] EWCA Civ 587]] where a housing association was found to be a hybrid public authority in relation to the actions it had carried out, which had impacted on the claimant’s article 8 rights.

#### Statute and private bodies

This more liberal line in Weaver has been further reflected in the coming into force of a specific statutory provision, designed to remedy the difficulties presented to the courts in care home cases like YL.

Section 145 of the [Health and Social Care Act 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/14/contents) specifically provides that a care home provider is to be taken (for the purposes of s. 6(3)(b)) to be exercising a function of a public nature when providing accommodation together with nursing or personal care. (This provision does not apply, however, to acts carried out before the Act came into force in July 2008).

The case law of the higher courts is still relevant to cases which do not concern care falling under s.145, and to cases which concern an entirely different context, such as in Aston Cantlow.

The final category recognised by the HRA 1998 are private bodies with no public functions at all (HRA 1998, s. 6(5)). Although private individuals do not owe obligations under the ECHR, their conduct may be regulated in a Convention compatible way under the indirect horizontal effect of the HRA.

#### s 7 HRA: standing

Just as a person bringing a claim under the HRA 1998 must satisfy the court that it is against a ‘public authority’ for the purpose of s. 6(1), the applicant must also show that they have standing to bring the claim.

Under s. 7 (1) HRA an applicant must show that s/he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act. Section 7(7) HRA states that 
> ‘…a person is a victim of an unlawful act only if he would be a victim for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention…’

So, the HRA has effectively incorporated the victim test from Article 34, ECHR. This provides that:
> ‘The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights…’

In addition, in order to satisfy the victim test under article 34, the ECtHR has held that applicants must show that they are directly affected by the state action: [[Klass v Germany (1978) 2 EHRR 214]]. This can be seen as a narrower test for standing than the ‘sufficient interest’ test in judicial review.

##### Scope of standing test

Applicants must be a 'person' in the legal sense and therefore can be natural or legal persons, such as corporate bodies - see, for example, the case of [[Sunday Times v UK (1979-80) 2 EHRR 245]]. Other organisations with legal personality include trade unions and political parties.

However, such organisations or groups can only bring an action when they are claiming that their rights (as an organisation) have been violated.

For instance, a non-governmental organisation (‘NGO’) cannot bring actions on behalf of people whose rights may have been violated by a contracting state. A good example of this came in the case of [[Re Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission [2018] UKSC 27]], in which the Supreme Court found that the NIHRC did not have standing to challenge the compatibility of the highly restrictive law in N. Ireland relating to abortion.

An NGO can only bring an action when it can claim that a state is violating the rights that it enjoys itself as an organisation. Thus, in [[Liberty v UK (2009) 48 EHRR 1]], the pressure group successfully complained that the interception of its communications under the Interception of Communications Act 1985 conferred a virtually unfettered discretion on the Ministry of Defence. This represented a breach of article 8.

#### Indirect victims

An applicant may, however, be an indirect victim of a violation in exceptional circumstances, for instance close relatives of a deceased person where complainants allege a violation of the right to life.

It is possible in very exceptional circumstances for a ‘person’ without close relative status to be given standing to challenge a particularly egregious violation of the ECHR, as occurred in the case of Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of [[Valentin Campeanu v. Romania (2014) ECHR 222]]. 

Note that the concept of what a 'person' is has also raised some difficult issues for the ECtHR. The question of the 'right to life' of the foetus in relation to article 2 has proven almost impossible to resolve, and the court has arguably avoided the issue in order to take account of regional and religious sensitivities relating to abortion: [[Vô v France (2005) 40 EHRR 12]].

#### Time limits

Actions under the HRA 1998 must be commenced within one year of the date of the act complained of: HRA 1998, s. 7(5).

An extension of time may be granted in exceptional cases where the court considers it 'equitable' to do so in all the circumstances.

If the alleged violation of a right is considered to be a continuing matter rather than a single incident, time will not start running until the violation ceases to operate. This point was made by the Supreme Court in the case of [[O’Connor v Bar Standards Board [2017] UKSC 78]] in over-turning an order to strike out the claimant’s case.

Note, however, that if a HRA claim is being brought within a wider judicial review application, the stricter JR time limits will apply ([[Al-Saadoon v Secretary of State for Defence [2016] EWHC 773 (Admin)]]).

#### Article 1 EHCR jurisdiction

The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in this convention.

Note that, under the terms of Article 1, there is no requirement of citizenship or residency of a contracting state in order to benefit from the Convention protections. The test is whether the person is within the jurisdiction of the state. For example, an American tourist in the UK could be a victim under the Convention and therefore, make a claim under the HRA 1998.

#### Extended jurisdiction

In certain exceptional circumstances, a person could make a claim for acts that have occurred outside the geographical jurisdiction of the relevant contracting state.

In [[Bankovic v Belgium (2001) 11 BHRC 435]], which concerned the bombing of Belgrade by NATO forces, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR observed that, while Article 1 reflects an essentially territorial notion of jurisdiction, extra-territorial jurisdiction could be recognised in some very limited circumstances.

These could include matters arising from the activities of diplomatic staff abroad, for instance, or when the state has effective control of the relevant territory and its inhabitants abroad as a consequence of military occupation, or because the government of that territory had consented or acquiesced to the exercise of its powers.

A number of important cases have arisen as a result of UK military involvement in Iraq since 2003. 

- [[R (Al-Skeini and Others) v Secretary of State for Defence [2007] UKHL 26]] - generally, the UK did not have sufficient control over Iraq.
- Conversely, in [[Al-Skeini and Others v UK [2011] ECHR 55721 07]] the ECtHR found that in the special circumstances which applied in Iraq in 2003–4, when the UK and USA were effectively occupying powers with responsibility for security, the extent of control and power exercised by the UK military was sufficient to render the actions of its armed forces subject to regulation under the ECHR and HRA, whether on or off UK bases. Thus, the scope of the concept of jurisdiction was significantly widened.

In relation to the rights of UK armed forces personnel serving overseas, domestic law initially fell in step with the earlier ECtHR decisions in Bankovic and the House of Lords decision in Al-Skeini. For instance, in [[R (Jason Smith) v Secretary of State for Defence [2010] UKSC 29]], the Supreme Court found that jurisdiction under the ECHR and HRA did not extend to the protection of the deceased soldier’s rights because he died in an area seen to be outside the UK’s control. (He died of heatstroke whilst he was serving in the field of combat in Iraq in 2003.)

In the conjoined appeals of [[Smith, Ellis and Allbutt v Ministry of Defence [2013] UKSC 41]], however, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that the so-called 'Snatch Land Rover claims', similarly relating to the deaths of British services personnel operating in the field of combat in Iraq (in 2005 and 2006), did attract the protection of the Convention.

Lord Hope found that the ECtHR’s position in Bankovic had been partly redefined in Al-Skeini v UK. The key element was the degree of control and authority exercised by the relevant state over the individual. When considering the way in which the armed forces operate, he held that serviceman relinquish almost total control over their lives to the state. Accordingly, deaths of servicemen in the battlefield fall within the jurisdiction of Article 1. R (Jason Smith) was departed from, as it was inconsistent with Al-Skeini.

#### Derogations

The technical rules concerning the operation of derogations can be found in sections 14 and 16 of the HRA. However, we are more concerned with the provision that covers the circumstances in which contracting states are able to derogate from (or ‘opt out of’) the rights protected by the ECHR. Article 15 ECHR provides that:

> In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation any High Contracting Party may take measures derogating from its obligations under this Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation …
> No derogation from Article 2, except in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war, or from Articles 3, 4 (para 1) and 7 shall be made under this provision’.

The test in article 15(1) as to the extent of any derogation constitutes a proportionality approach. When the derogation right is invoked, the last word as to the lawfulness of the derogation rests not with the state but with the courts of that state, and finally, if necessary, the ECtHR. You will recall that a derogation from article 5(1) was at issue in [[A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56]], the ‘Belmarsh case’.

#### Reservations

As with derogations, the provisions in the HRA 1998 (sections 15 and 17) concern the procedure and operation for reservations. The key provision is found in article 57 of the ECHR.

Reservations can be made under article 57. Any contracting state may, at the time of signing or ratifying the ECHR, make its acceptance subject to a condition, which limits or varies the application of the ECHR to that state. The UK has a reservation to article 2 of the First Protocol to the Convention (the 'right to education’).

Note that, as with derogations, the ECtHR will not always passively accept a reservation. In [[Belilos v Switzerland (1988) 10 EHRR 466]], the ECtHR removed (or 'severed') elements from a 'declaration' made by the Swiss government that the government claimed amounted to a reservation. This was held to be so vague as to amount to a 'reservation of a general character' (prohibited by article 57). The ECtHR has taken the view that it alone has responsibility for deciding what is or is not a reservation.
