## Introduction

Judicial review is concerned with checking the exercise of public power. From a constitutional perspective, the courts should not be concerned with the merits of a decision, but rather with whether such a decision has been correctly made and implemented according to law.

It is important to appreciate that judicial review is not the same as appeal. The courts do not substitute their own decision for that of the decision-maker but can direct, for example, that the decision be made again in the correct manner.

## Limitations

There are limitations on the availability of judicial review. Five main preliminary issues need to be considered before a judicial review claim can be pursued:

- Amenability
- Procedural exclusivity
- Standing
- Time limits
- Ouster clauses

## Amenability

Only public law decisions are amenable to judicial review. 

> [!defn]
> **The Civil Procedure Rules Part 54.1(2)(a)(ii)** defines judicial review in terms of
> 
> > ‘a claim to review the lawfulness of…a decision, action or failure to act in relation to the exercise of a public function’.

The archetypal situation, in which judicial review is the appropriate legal course of action, is when the decision relates to a public body carrying out a public function, almost always through the exercise of some form of statutory power. Such bodies include central government departments, local authorities, inferior courts, statutory tribunals, and statutory bodies such as the Highway Agency. 

> [!note]
> Since the decision in [[Council for the Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374]] (GCHQ), decisions taken in the exercise of prerogative powers are also amenable to judicial review.
#### Broadened scope

$\exists$ other situations in which judicial review can be the appropriate route for a legal challenge. 

Historically, the courts looked at the source of a body’s power when deciding whether it would be subject to judicial review. If the body was created by or exercised power pursuant to statute, as with classic public bodies, its decisions would normally be amenable to judicial review. The potential scope of judicial review has expanded, however, following the lead case of [[R v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin [1987] QB 815]] [^1].

[^1]: N.B. This case predates the Civil Procedure Rules, but it remains a very important authority in understanding the courts’ approach to amenability.

#### Regulatory authorities

The decisions of regulatory authorities are generally found to be amenable to JR if the functions they are carrying out have a sufficiently public and governmental character. One way in which this issue is addressed is by the courts applying a form of *‘but for’* test.

For example, a decision of the Advertising Standards Authority ([[R v Advertising Standards Authority Ltd, ex parte Insurance Services plc (1989) 9 Tr LR 169]]) was deemed to be amenable to JR. The court considered that, had there not been a self-regulatory authority already in existence, Parliament would almost certainly have needed to intervene and regulate the activity in question. The function played by the ASA was therefore sufficiently public in nature.

Similarly, in[[ R v Bar Council ex parte Percival [1990] 3 All ER 137]] a decision of the Bar Council was found to be subject to review.

However, the decisions of some regulatory authorities have been found not to be amenable to judicial review, particularly in the field of sporting and religious regulation. The next slide considers some cases in these areas.

In [[R v Disciplinary Committee of the Jockey Club, ex parte Aga Khan [1993] 2 All ER 853]] Sir Thomas Bingham MR stated:

> ‘While the Jockey Club’s powers may be described as, in many ways, public they are in no sense governmental… the powers which the Jockey Club exercises over those who (like the applicant) agree to be bound by the Rules of Racing derive from the agreement of the parties and give rise to private rights on which effective action for a declaration, an injunction and damages can be based without resort to judicial review’.

Similarly, in [[R v Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregation of GB and Commonwealth, ex parte Wachmann [1993] 2 All ER 249]] the court was of the opinion that internal matters within a religion were of a private nature and therefore could not be subject to judicial review.

#### Contracting out

The policy of ‘contracting out’ services to private service providers, introduced since the 1980s, has complicated the amenability question. Two key cases can be compared.

- [[R v Servite Houses & London Borough of Wandsworth, ex parte Goldsmith [2001] LGR 55]], 
- [[R (on the application of A) v Partnerships In Care [2002] EWHC (Admin) 529]]

## Procedural exclusivity

Closely related to the more general question of amenability is the sub-issue of procedural exclusivity. The House of Lords decisions in [[O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] 2 AC 237]] and [[Cocks v Thanet DC [1982] 3 All ER 1135]] established a general procedural rule. The Lords determined that:

- Judicial review was the exclusive procedure for challenging public law decisions
- Private law matters were to be dealt with by ordinary action
- To bring a public law challenge in any other way than by JR would amount to an abuse of process of the court.

#### Exceptions

In the case of [[O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] 2 AC 237]] itself, Lord Diplock stated that two exceptions to the principle could apply

1. When neither party objected to the use of private law procedure and 
2. when the contested decision was collateral, i.e., it arose out of or was incidental to some other legal claim. 

The decision in O’Reilly has been widely criticised because potentially ‘genuine’ cases could be struck out if incorrect procedure was used.

A body of case law has built up around mixed claims, which are claims where the applicant’s public and private law rights are affected. 

#### Mixed claims

 Case law authorities show that where a claim involves both public and private law rights the courts are willing to be flexible.

One of the most important decisions in this area is [[Roy v Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster Family Practitioner Committee (FPC) [1992] 1 AC 624]]. 

The Civil Procedure Rules have further diluted the strictness of the courts’ initial approach to procedural exclusivity. In the case of [[Clark v University of Lincolnshire and Humberside [2000] 3 All ER 752]], the applicant was permitted to pursue her private claim even though it involved public law issues as well as private ones. The court identified that a key question was not so much strict adherence to procedural technicalities but rather whether the proceedings were being conducted justly in accordance with the general principles contained in [Part 1 Civil Procedure Rules](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part01).

Note also that public law grounds can also potentially be used as a defence in private law proceedings – see for example [[Wandsworth London BC v Winder [1985] AC 461]].

## Standing

Even if the relevant decision is amenable to judicial review, not everyone nor every organisation can make an application. A necessary pre-condition for bringing a judicial review application is that the particular applicant has standing (or locus standi).

The [Senior Courts Act 1981, s. 31(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/31) stipulates that:

> 'No application for judicial review shall be made unless the leave of the High Court has been obtained in accordance with the rules of court …'

Furthermore, it provides that:

> '… the court shall not grant leave unless it considers that the applicant has sufficient interest in the matter to which the application relates.'

#### ‘Fleet Street Casuals’ case

Standing was considered by the House of Lords in [[IRC v National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses [1982] AC 617]] (often known as the 'Fleet Street Casuals' case). The case lacks a clear ratio, but a series of principles can be taken from the various opinions of the law lords.

Lord Scarman described the ‘sufficient interest’ test as being a mixed question of **law and fact**, and emphasised the importance of the **connection** between the applicant’s degree of interest and the matter in contention.

Lord Diplock endorsed a liberal approach to standing, including for groups, not simply directly affected individuals:

> 'It would, in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group, like the Federation, or even a single public-spirited taxpayer, were prevented by outdated technical rules of locus standi from bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the rule of law and get the unlawful conduct stopped.’

#### Two stage approach

In *Fleet Street Casuals*, the House of Lords took the view that standing was not just a preliminary issue. The merits of the case and issues of standing should be considered together at the main hearing, too. A two-stage approach has since developed:

##### Initial permission stage

At this stage the standing test is designed to turn away those with little hope of success or vexatious litigants – these were described by the court in the *Fleet Street Casuals* case as ‘busybodies, cranks and other mischief-makers’.

##### Full hearing stage

Standing can be re-considered. At this stage, the court could consider in more detail whether the applicant can show a strong enough case on the merits, taking into account the proximity of his connection to the issue in the case.

#### Application of the standing rules

The *Fleet Street Casuals* case did not provide a definitive answer to the sufficient interest test in circumstances where groups and individuals are not immediately affected by a decision but are clearly not ‘busybodies’ or ‘mischief-makers’ either. A body of case law has developed concerning the standing rules and different categories of claimants.

#### Associations
When it comes to associations of individuals, who would themselves all be seen to have sufficient interest, the courts are generally content to allow that association standing in order to challenge a matter in the communal interest.

A good example of this can be seen in [[R v Liverpool Corporation, ex parte Liverpool Taxi Fleet Operators' Association [1972] 2 QB 299]].

#### Pressure and interest groups

The courts treat pressure groups differently from associations because they are unlikely to be in a position where all the membership is directly affected. Notwithstanding the liberal approach endorsed by Lord Diplock in Fleet Street Casuals, a restrictive view was adopted by the High Court in [[R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Rose Theatre Trust Co Ltd [1990] 1 QB 504]].

Subsequent cases have seen the reassertion of a more liberal approach. Standing was given to pressure groups in the following two cases:
- [[Ex parte Greenpeace Ltd (No 2) [1994] 4 All ER 329]]
- [[Ex parte World Development Movement Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 386]]

#### Individuals: concerned citizens

An individual who is directly affected by a public law decision should have little difficulty satisfying the sufficient interest test. The courts have, however, had to consider those who seek to challenge decisions because they are concerned as a citizen about a particular issue, not because they are directly affected by it. The liberalising trend in the courts’ approach to standing is well reflected in this area.

In [[R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Rees-Mogg [1994] QB 552]], the former editor of The Times newspaper, who had frequently written about EU membership, was held to have standing to challenge the signing of the Treaty of European Union ('the Maastricht Treaty') because of his 'sincere concern for constitutional issues’.

In [[R v Somerset County Council ex parte Dixon [1998] Env LR 111]], Sedley J disagreed with the approach of the court in [[R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Rose Theatre Trust Co Ltd [1990] 1 QB 504]]. 

In his view, it was not necessary for a claimant to establish that he had a greater right or expectation than any other citizen in order to be granted leave. 

Judicial review was not about rights: it was about wrongs, in the context of the misuse of public power. Dixon, who wished to challenge a planning permission decision was not a busybody or a trouble-maker. He was entitled to be concerned about illegality in the planning permission process.

#### The Worboys case

It is notable, however, that the courts will not necessarily allow standing if there are other better placed challengers.

In the case of [[R (DSD and NBV) v The Parole Board [2018] EWHC 694 (Admin)]], the Mayor of London was one of the parties seeking to challenge the Parole Board’s decision to allow the release of the convicted rapist, John Worboys.

The court accepted that the Mayor had a genuine concern for the potential danger that may be faced by women in London. Statutory duties attached to his office, and he had an interest in tacking crime and supporting its victims in the capital. However, his interest was not specific enough to the workings of the Parole Board. The Mayor’s interest was distinguished from that of William Rees-Mogg because there were more directly impacted challengers to the Parole Board’s decision, notably the individuals, DSD and NBV, who claimed to be Worboys’ victims. The court stated:

> ‘The Mayor is, of course, entitled to comment on Parole Board decisions, and any concerns he might express would attract public attention, but, in our view, he is in no different position from any other politician or, indeed, any member of the public.’

## Time limits

The time limit for a judicial review application is short and strictly applied. [CPR Part 54.5(1)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part54) states that:

> 'a claim must be filed (a) promptly and (b) in any event no later than **3 months** after the grounds to make the claim first arose’.

Therefore, judicial review can sometimes be refused if a claim is not filed promptly, even if it was filed within three months.

CPR Part 54.5(2) stipulates that time cannot be extended by agreement between the parties, although it can be extended by the court pursuant to its general power under CPR Part 3.1(2)(a).

The [Senior Courts Act 1981, s. 31(6)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/31) makes it clear that, where there has been undue delay, judicial review can be refused if the court 
> 'considers that the granting of the relief sought would be likely to cause substantial hardship to, or substantially prejudice the rights of, any person or would be detrimental to good administration'.

## Ouster clauses

See [[Parliamentary sovereignty and the Common Law#Ouster clauses and sovereignty]].

An ouster clause is a legislative provision which, on its face, appears to exclude (to 'oust') the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court to conduct a judicial review.

Such clauses are rare. However, if they do appear to apply, the courts are generally hostile towards them.

They are seen, in constitutional terms, as representing an insult to the rule of law. Judicial review is seen by the courts as a vitally important constitutional function, designed to ensure that the executive is kept legally to account. Moreover, it is seen as an important right for all citizens.

The modern judiciary has responded to such threats to its jurisdiction by developing, as part of its constitutional duty of interpreting statute, a very strong presumption that Parliament does not intend to exclude judicial review.

Recall the key cases:
- [[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 2 AC 137]]
- [[R (Privacy International) v Investigatory Powers Tribunal [2019] UKSC 22]

#### Time limit ousters (partial ousters)

 A partial or time limit ouster clause is a legislative provision that excludes the jurisdiction of the court once a time limit has expired. If one applies, it is therefore even more restrictive for claimants than usual, but it does not remove access to judicial review entirely.

The courts have therefore responded to these provisions by taking them at face value and enforcing them. This was made clear by the House of Lords in [[Smith v East Elloe RDC [1956] 1 All ER 855]]. Although there was some criticism of the East Elloe decision in Anisminic, the approach was reaffirmed by the [[R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Ostler [1977] QB 122]].

It has more recently been reinforced by [Civil Procedure Rule 54.5(3)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part54) which provides that the normal time limit does 'not apply when any other enactment specifies a shorter time limit for making the claim for judicial review’.

For example, the Civil Procedure (Amendment No 4) Rules 2013 provide shorter time limits for challenges to planning decisions and public procurement decisions. The limitation periods are now six weeks and 30 days respectively for these two areas of judicial review.

## Reform of judicial review

In recent years, there has been a significant degree of governmental criticism about the scope of judicial review. Some changes have been made, in addition to the Civil Procedure (Amendment No 4) Rules 2013, and others are planned.

#### ‘Not substantially different test’
(see [s. 31(2A) Senior Courts Act 1981](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/31) as amended by the [Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/2/contents/enacted)). 

The provision states that the court must refuse to grant relief on an application for judicial review 
> “if it appears to the court to be highly likely that the outcome for the applicant would not have been substantially different if the conduct complained of had not occurred”. 

This affects a claimant’s standing and access to remedies.

#### Independent Review of Administrative Law

This reported in March 2021. It did not propose the wide-scale changes that some in government wished for, but it appears that calls for change have not ended. To date, further reform is restricted to clause 1 of the [Judicial Review and Courts Bill 2021](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3035) relating to the effect and timing of quashing orders.
