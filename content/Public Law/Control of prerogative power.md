## Control of prerogative power

Four ways to control prerogative power:
- By the application of public law (judicial review jurisdiction of the courts)
- Over-riding effect of statute (legislation 'trumps' the prerogative)
- Informally, by political pressure in government and public life (e.g., the media)
- Informally, by changes to convention over time

The potential for prerogative power to be abused is high. Certain political mechanisms can be adopted to modify this effect, but it is primarily controlled through the courts. 

#### Degree of control

Development of the courts' ability to check and review the executive's use of prerogative power has been growing since 17th Century. The flashpoint came in 1980s with the GCHQ case. 

Recall for brownie points, 1640s Charles I imposed 'Ship Money' taxes, Chief Justice Coke established that royal prerogative represented a finite stock of power. 

Crown power was legitimated through recognition in common law: a particular form of prerogative power could not be said to exist unless the courts accepted that there was a precedent for it having been used in the past. 

> 'The King hath no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him.'
> _Case of Proclamations_ (1611) 12 Co Rep 74.

[[Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029]]: government claimed to have the legal authority to enter and search Entick's premises under a 'general warrant'. He was later suspected of association with radical leader John Wilkes. Entick challenged as trespass on his property. 

[[BBC v Johns [1965] Ch 32]]: Lord Diplock said
> 'It is 350 years and a civil war too late for the Queen's courts to broaden the prerogative.'

#### Prerogative and statute

[[Attorney-General v De Keyser's Hotel Ltd [1920] AC 508]]: dispute between the government and hotel owners about whether compensation should be payable for the requisitioning of a hotel for use by the Army Council during WW1. 

#### The De Keyser principle

The Attorney-General claimed that the government could effectively choose to use its historic prerogative power to take emergency action during war 'defence of the realm', even if the Parliament had legislated on same ground. 

Law lords decisively rejected this contention and stated that the Crown was bound in this situation by the statutory regime applying under the Defence of the Realm Act and associated Regulations. 

#### Effect of prerogative

Lord Atkinson explained that the statutory had 'abridged' the older prerogative powers and that the prerogative was considered 'in abeyance', i.e., suspended, if not necessarily permanently extinguished. 

> 'When a statute, expressing the will and intention of the King and of the three estates of the realm, is passed, it abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force to this extent: that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions, and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance.'

#### Implied suspension by statute

[[Laker Airways v Dept of Trade [1977] QB 643]]: government sought to justify a reversal of aviation policy through use of prerogative power to negotiate international treaties. 

[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p. Fire Brigades Union [1995] 2 A.C. 513]].

Also think about [[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5]]. Can be seen as a 'legality' case, as the challengers' argument was that the PM simply did not have the power to trigger Art 50 using the prerogative. The Admin Court and the majority in the UKSC ultimately agreed.

The majority decision centred around the conviction that it was constitutionally inappropriate for the process of leaving the EU to be triggered by use of the prerogative when the effects and consequences of this process would be so significant for the UK.

It was felt that a step of such magnitude, leading to a notable change in the law of the land and in individual rights, could only be sanctioned by Parliament through primary legislation.

A complete withdrawal represents a change which is different not just in degree but in kind from the abrogation of particular rights. 

The case of Miller v S o S for Exiting the EU can be seen to fit broadly in a line from De Keyser through the Laker and FBU cases as it confirmed that significant changes to statutory rights and, on a higher plane, to the UK’s constitutional arrangements could not be prompted solely by use of prerogative power.

#### Limit to De Keyser

One controversial case suggests a limit in certain situations involving over-lapping statutory and prerogative powers. 

[[R v S o S for the Home Department ex p Northumbria Police Authority [1998] 1 All ER 556]]. 


## GCHQ and substantive review

Until mid-80s, senior UK courts had not reached a point where they were prepared to review how the government used its prerogative powers. 

There were some developments at a lower level ([[R v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex parte Lain [1967] 2 QB 864]]) but these were minimal. 

> Key case: [[Council for the Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374]]: known as 'GCHQ'. 

#### Orbiter

The judges' bold main line on reviewability in the case came with a notable word of caution.

They pointed out that, even though there should be no future differentiation between prerogative and statutory powers, a number of notable prerogative powers governed areas that broadly involved matters of high policy.

These comments, expressed most clearly by Lord Roskill, have assumed considerable subsequent influence on the development of the law, though it's important to note that they were obiter rather than being part of the main ratio in GCHQ.

The prerogative powers that Lord Roskill listed were, in his view:

> “… not … susceptible to judicial review because their nature and subject matter are such as not to be amenable to the judicial process.”

They included:
- The making of treaties
- Defence of the realm
- Mercy
- Granting of honours
- Dissolution of Parliament (note that this power is now governed by statute)
- Appointment of ministers ('and others…')

When Roskill referred to the 'amenability' of such matters to the process of judicial review, he demonstrated how the judiciary regulate the extent of their own involvement in the more political areas of public law. This is an attempt by the judiciary to respect appropriate informal lines of responsibility in the UK's delicate constitutional balance. Areas in which the judiciary have no jurisdiction are called 'non-justiciable' (though it is debatable how useful this term is).

## Post-GCHQ

The courts have increasingly tailored the degree of their interventionism based on the **nature** of the power that the government has used, rather than its **form**. 

The pattern of development in judicial review has been towards greater promotion of a substantive conception of the rule of law. One of the elements of this is a drive towards **greater accountability** in government. Judicial review is the main mechanism for this. But this is conditioned by separation of powers considerations. 

In matters involving substantive issues, the approach applied by the judiciary is contextual. This applies equally to situations in which the judiciary are asked to review the exercise of prerogative/ statutory power. 

There is a spectrum in the intensity of review; if the matter is of high policy, the degree of review is low. 

Key case: [[R v SoS for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Everett [1989] 1 All ER 655]]

This demonstrated a willingness by the courts to consider the substance of the issue, rather than being restricted by pre-conceived limitations. 

Similarly, the government's argument that a matter was entirely non-justiciable was dismissed in [[R v SoS for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley [1993] 4 All ER 442]]. 

These are examples of issues coming before the court in which the nature of the powers used were relatively low-level/ administrative. 

#### Foreign policy and diplomacy

Matters touching on the diplomatic relationships between the UK and other states are clearly matters of higher policy. Such challenges have been nonetheless been accepted by the Administrative courts, in the sense that challengers have been allowed standing to bring the matter before court. 

[[R (Abbasi) v Foreign Secretary [2002] EWCA Civ 1598]]

A UK national, Feroz Abbasi was detained at Guantanamo Bay. His family sought to challenge the UK Foreign Office on the basis that it had not done enough to try to extricate him from this predicament, which the US declared was not subject to international law. Lord Phillips MR put it as follows:

> ‘To what extent, if at all, can the English court examine whether a foreign state is in breach of treaty obligations or public international law where fundamental human rights are engaged? To what extent, if at all, is a decision of the executive in the field of foreign relations justiciable in the English court?’

The court ultimately found for the Foreign Office. However, this was seen to be an area in which the courts had minimal competence and in which the executive were the primary decision-makers. As Lord Diplock had put it in GCHQ:

> “the kind of evidence that is admissible … and the way in which it has to be adduced tend to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which, if the Executive discretion is to be wisely exercised, need to be weighed against one another — a balancing exercise which judges by their upbringing and experience are ill-qualified to perform.”

#### Lower intensity review

> "Whether to make any representations in a particular case, and if so in what form, is left entirely to the discretion of the Secretary of State. That gives free play to the “balance” to which Lord Diplock referred in GCHQ. The Secretary of State must be free to give full weight to foreign policy considerations, which are not justiciable. However, that does not mean the whole process is immune from judicial scrutiny. The citizen's legitimate expectation is that his request will be “considered”, and that in that consideration all relevant factors will be thrown into the balance."
> Per Lord Phillips MR

#### Defence of the realm

Military action and how to conduct such operations are matters of high policy and the executive has sole competence over such areas. This approach was highlighted in a number of cases relating to the legality of the Iraq war. 

- In [[R (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) v Prime Minister of the UK (2002) EWHC 2759 QB]] Simon Brown LJ stated that it was: 
> 'accept[ed] that the decision to take military action is beyond the court's purview'.

- In [[Smith, Ellis and Allbutt v Ministry of Defence [2013] UKSC 41]] the Supreme Court held that the doctrine of combat immunity (which excludes liability for negligence in relation to military combat) should be construed narrowly. The decisions taken by military commanders in relation to military engagements should be non-justiciable, but failings remote from the battlefield should be subject to judicial review. 

#### Membership of the armed forces

In [[R v Ministry of Defence, ex parte Smith [1996] QB 517]], the MoD's policy of not employing homosexuals in the armed forces was challenged.

#### Colonial governance

Prerogative power is still relevant to the governance of British Overseas Territories: [[R (Bancoult) v SoS for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2008] UKHL 61]]

## Justiciability revisited

Post-GCHQ, we are drawn towards a functionalist rather than formalist interpretation of constitutional principle. 

[[Chandler v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 763]] offers an example: the Court held that the question of evaluating threats to national security was not justiciable. The gravity of any claimed threat to national security was a claim which could only be evaluated by the government. Evidence was required, at least technically, but an affidavit from an Air Commodore stating that any intrusion to the air strip was 'prejudicial to the safety of the state' was considered sufficient. 

Result similar to that in GCHQ: in theory the government is subjected to a burden of proof to demonstrate it was motivated by national security considerations. In practice, that requirement is a formality, discharged by flimsy evidence. 

Note that even if the GCHQ civil servants derived their employment from statute rather than prerogative, national security would still have been considered a non-justiciable issue. 

There may perhaps come a point where there seems to be no justification for claiming that national security issues arise. But this has not currently been tested. 

An issue: is the concept of non-justiciability defined too widely? In [[R (Bancoult) v SoS for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2008] UKHL 61]] the conclusion seem to imply in jurisprudential terms that the government is on equal footing as Parliament as a sovereign law-maker. It is for the citizen to persuade Parliament to prevent the government from depriving her of even so basic an entitlement as the right to live in her homeland, rather than the government to persuade Parliament to allow it to do so. 

Key takeaway: the courts are not the only means to regulate the government's use of prerogative or statutory powers. There are also political methods of control.
