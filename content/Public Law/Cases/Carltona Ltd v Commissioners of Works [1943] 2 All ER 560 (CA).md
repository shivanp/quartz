### Summary

The whole system of departmental organisation and administration was based on the constitutional notion that the decision of a government official was constitutionally that of his Minister, who alone was answerable to Parliament. This case gives its name to the "Carltona principle".

### Abstract

The appellant company (C) appealed against a decision dismissing a writ against the Commissioners of Works (W) for requisitioning C's factory and reallocating its workforce.

The Government was faced with a wartime shortage of accommodation and labour and under the Defence (General) Regulations 1939 reg.51(1) requisitioned a factory owned by C, a food manufacturer.

C submitted that 
(1) the notice was bad because it gave as a reason that the requisition was "essential in the national interest" whereas such wording was not contained in the Regulation; 
(2) the requisitioning authority W had failed to properly consider each alternative head individually; 
(3) the decision was one that no requisitioning authority could have come to.

### Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The notice was not mandatory and the evidence of the assistant secretary, to whom the decision had been delegated, was that its wording was a comprehensive phrase used as shorthand for the actual text of the Regulation.

(2) The Commissioners of Works was a body that never met but its powers were statutorily exercised by the Minister of Works and Planning. Public business could not be carried on if the responsible Minister had to personally consider every decision. The powers and duties of a minister were normally exercised by responsible officials in his department. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration was based on the constitutional notion that their decisions were his and he alone was responsible to Parliament. The minister was obliged to ensure that important duties were taken by appropriately qualified officials and he was answerable to Parliament if that were not the case. The particular heads in the Regulation were not mutually exclusive but overlapped so that many matters would fall under more than one head and it would have been a waste of time to determine under which particular head a case fell. It was quite clear that W had considered whether to requisition the property for some, or all of, the purposes in the Regulation.

(3) In the absence of bad faith, no court could interfere with the discretion of the executive to make decisions under legislation authorised by Parliament. The court was confined to ensuring that the power that the executive claimed to exercise was legitimately given by the legislature and to establish that power had been exercised in good faith.
