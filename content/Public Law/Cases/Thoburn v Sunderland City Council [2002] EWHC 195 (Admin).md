The case of Thoburn v Sunderland City Council [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin) involved market traders — the self-named 'Metric Martyrs' — who were convicted for using imperial measures (i.e., pounds and ounces) contrary to legislation enacted to implement a European directive.

They alleged in their appeal that the ECA 1972 (through which the directive had been implemented into UK law) was incompatible with the later Weights and Measures Act 1985, which allowed for the use of both metric and imperial measurements.

Their point was that the 1985 Act impliedly repealed the relevant aspect of the ECA 1972.

On the facts Laws LJ found no incompatibility, but he proceeded to make a number of obiter points which have been very influential in the modern debate over sovereignty.

> 'Ordinary statutes may be impliedly repealed. Constitutional statutes may not. For the repeal of a Constitutional Act … the court would apply this test: is it shown that the legislature's actual — not imputed, constructive or presumed — intention was to effect the repeal or abrogation? I think the test could only be met by express words in the later statute, or by words so specific that the inference of an actual determination to effect the result contended for was irresistible. The ordinary rule of implied repeal does not satisfy this test. Accordingly, it has no application to constitutional statutes.'
