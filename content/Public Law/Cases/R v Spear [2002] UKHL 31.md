### Abstract

In conjoined appeals, 12 defendants challenged two decisions ([2001] EWCA Crim 2311, Times, October 8, 2001 and [2001] EWCA Crim 2, [2001] Q.B. 804). The issue before the court was whether the trial of civil offences by courts martial was compatible with the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c34f27de98114fb5ba0fb868699e0397&contextData=(sc.Default)). 

The defendants contended that 
(1) the permanent presidents (PPCMs) of the courts martial lacked the impartiality and independence required by Art.6(1); 
(2) junior officers serving on the courts martial, being subject to army discipline and reports, also lacked the requisite independence and impartiality; 
(3) the role of the reviewing authority was, in itself, sufficient to undermine the independence and impartiality of the courts martial system, and 
(4) the culture and ethos of the services was such as to incline those who took part in courts martial to attach excessive weight to values of discipline and morale, to the point of rendering the trial unfair.

Held, dismissing the appeals, that the decision in _[Morris v United Kingdom (38784/97) (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 52, [2002] 2 WLUK 670](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I058ECB80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c34f27de98114fb5ba0fb868699e0397&contextData=(sc.Default))_ established that, in principle, a trial by court martial did not infringe an accused's rights under Art.6. The question as to whether the court was possessed of the requisite independence and impartiality depended upon the existence of satisfactory safeguards. In assessing the defendants' challenges to those safeguards, the court held that 

(1) the impartiality and independence of the PPCMs could not be impugned in the light of the judgment given in Morris. PPCMs were appointed towards the end of their service careers and had no effective hope of promotion and no effective fear of removal. They were answerable to no one for the discharge of their decision making function; 

(2) the rules governing the role of junior officers as members of the courts martial effectively protected the accused against the risk that they might be subject to "external army influence". Although Morris supported the contention that junior officers lacked the requisite degree of independence, the instant court felt sure that the European Court of Human Rights would have come to a different conclusion had the position been more fully explained to them; 

(3) the provision for review could only act to the benefit, and not to the detriment, of someone who had been convicted. In any event, a convicted person retained the right to appeal a review decision to the Court of Appeal. Thus, the role of the reviewing authority did not interfere with the defendants' rights under Art.6, and 

(4) in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the court could not accept that any modern officer would exercise his judgment otherwise than independently and impartially or be thought by any reasonable and informed observer to be at risk of doing so, Morris considered.
