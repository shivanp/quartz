The case concerned a journalist's Freedom of Information Act request in relation to a charity set up by the controversial politician, George Galloway.

The court's view was that it was the role of the judiciary, through the common law, to determine the application (or otherwise) of disclosure requirements in light of the above common law presumption.

Here again one can see the centrality of common law constitutional principles in determining such an issue.

### Summary

The [Freedom of Information Act 2000 s.32(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I37C5BA40E45111DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) provided an absolute exemption from any duty of disclosure under the Act of documents created by a public body or placed in its custody for the purposes of an inquiry conducted by that body. That exemption continued until the documents became historical records. The [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.10](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAE7756732A7B4BBC93274BDE4496FB0F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) did not require s.32(2) to be interpreted differently.

### Abstract

The appellant journalist (K) appealed against a decision (_[[2012] EWCA Civ 317, [2012] 1 W.L.R. 3524](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID35BC28072EC11E186A3FF676EA0C302/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default))_) that the respondent Charity Commission was not required to disclose under the [Freedom of Information Act 2000](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FACCF40E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) documents concerning an inquiry it had conducted.

The Commission had refused disclosure on the basis that the documents were exempt from disclosure under [s.32(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I37C5BA40E45111DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) and it was not required to disclose them until they became historical records 30 years after their creation.

K argued that the exemption only subsisted for the duration of the relevant inquiry; if a natural construction of s.32(2) did not produce that result, the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.10](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAE7756732A7B4BBC93274BDE4496FB0F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) required it to be read down to produce that result.

### Held

Appeal dismissed.

(Lords Wilson and Carnwath dissenting as to the effect of art.10) 

(1) The critical phrase in s.32, "for the purposes of â€¦" was repeated in relation to and placed at the end of each head of documents identified. Read naturally, it qualified each head. To read it as referring back to the initial words of each sub-section was far-fetched. Further [s.63(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I37DC2870E45111DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)), dealing with historical records, mentioned s.32: the natural inference was that it was contemplated that information falling within s.32 would continue to be exempt for 30 years. 

The scheme of the [Inquiries Act 2005](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5D1BEB30E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) was different from that which applied under the 2000 Act in respect of a Charity Commission inquiry; in any event, the position under the 2005 Act could not affect the construction of the earlier Act. 

Section 32 had been intended to provide an absolute exemption which would not cease at the end of the court, arbitration or inquiry proceedings, but would continue until the relevant documents became historical records. That did not mean that the information held by the Commission as a result of its inquiries could not be required to be disclosed outside s.32 under other statutory and/or common law powers preserved by [s.78](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I37E59E50E45111DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) (see paras [28-34](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment). 

As s.32 left open the position regarding disclosure outside the 2000 Act, that directed attention to the [Charities Act 2011](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6DC8D490286D11E1AB96C6B9D162ADDD/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)); if that Act put K in a position no less favourable regarding disclosure than that which he contended should be provided under art.10, there was no basis for requiring s.32 to be read down in the light of art.10. Even if the 2011 Act appeared to not fully satisfy K's art.10 rights, it did not follow that the fault lay with s.32, or that s.32 should be remoulded by the courts to provide such rights. In view of the clarity of the absolute exemption in s.32, the focus would be on the 2011 Act. Article 10 would not add anything significant to such rights to disclosure as could be enforced under the 2011 Act. Further, reading down s.32(2) so that it ceased to apply at the end of an inquiry would mean that the public interest test in [s.2(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I37AA9120E45111DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=60e64a71898f43189066730005dbde45&contextData=(sc.Default)) would also cease to apply. It followed that, were K's art.10 rights not catered for, the most that could be contemplated would be a general declaration of incompatibility. K's claim failed (paras [35-42](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). 

(2) (Obiter) The 2011 Act did not put K in any less favourable a position than he would be if art.10 imposed on public authorities a general duty of disclosure of information. In any event, art.10 did not contain so general a duty (para.[101](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). 

(3) (Per Lords Wilson and Carnwath) The absolute exemption from disclosure for 30 years produced by the natural reading of s.32(2) was not compatible with art.10. The sub-section should be given an unnatural alternative construction with the result that it had no effect following the end of the Commission's inquiries (para.[200](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
