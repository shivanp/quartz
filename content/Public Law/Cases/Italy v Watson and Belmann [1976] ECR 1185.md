The Pretura of Milan referred several questions to the European Court under the Treaty of Rome 1957 Art.177 for a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of the Treaty of Rome 1957 Art.48 and the Treaty of Rome 1957 Art.66. A Mr Belmann had given accommodation to a Miss Watson, a British citizen, without notifying the local authority in Milan. Miss Watson had not made a declaration of residence. Both these acts were required by Italian law.

Held, national courts must decide if and to what degree citizens of other Member States are covered by the EEC provisions allowing freedom of movement of workers, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. Arts 48 to 66 EEC are self-executing provisions. The requirements such as were imposed on Mr. Belmann and Miss Watson are compatible with these articles in principle provided that the time set out in which to report is reasonable and that penalties for non-compliance are not too severe and do not include deportation. Where there is no infringement of these articles and the rights they grant and residence rules are objectively determined there is no case of discrimination on grounds of nationality within the meaning of the Treaty of Rome 1957 Art.7.
