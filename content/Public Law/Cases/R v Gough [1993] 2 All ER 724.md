The correct test in cases where bias of a jury member is alleged, is whether there is a real risk that the accused might have been denied a fair trial.

The court dismissed the accused's claim that there had been a serious irregularity.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the test to be applied in all cases of apparent bias is whether there was a real danger that the appellant had not had a fair trial, and on that test the Court of Appeal had been entitled to decide as they did ( _[R. v Spencer (Alan Widdison) [1987] A.C. 128, [1986] 7 WLUK 227](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6A8E33E0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2512296200a34f7593ee6fe7a4163fe7&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[R. v Sussex Justices Ex p.
