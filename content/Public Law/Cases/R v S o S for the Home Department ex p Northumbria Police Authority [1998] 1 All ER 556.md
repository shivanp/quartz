 The Home Secretary sought to establish a central store for providing plastic baton rounds and other riot-control equipment to the various national police forces.

Northumbria P.A. argued that the Police Act 1964 gave it a monopoly over the supply of equipment to the police force in its area. The Court of Appeal held that the P.A.'s power to supply equipment under the Act did not give it a monopoly and that the Act did not override the Home Secretary’s prerogative power to keep the peace within the realm.

The rationalisation behind this varied to an extent between the judges.

Croom-Johnson LJ held that the Home Secretary’s use of the prerogative was not incompatible with the police authority’s powers under the Act.

Purchas LJ took the view that a prerogative power may still apply if it is directed to the benefit or protection of the individual — as opposed to restricting the rights of the individual (as could be argued was the case in _De Keyser_ or _Fire Brigades_, for instance) — and if the statute does not unequivocally deprive individuals of that benefit or protection.

This remains a **much-disputed decision**, but arguably it is less functionally significant in the modern day, now that in principle (following the _GCHQ_ case) the courts do not distinguish between judicial review of statutory and prerogative powers.

Recognition of the British Parliament’s jurisdiction in permitting any action deemed necessary for the maintenance of the nation’s peace.

### Facts

Public disturbances some years earlier resulted in the Home Office opting to create a stock of CS gas (commonly known as riot control gas) alongside a store of plastic crowd control batons, for easy access by the authorities in times of need. An internal circular memo stated that the Home Secretary would be authorised to give access to such stores where necessary, which the Northumbria Police Authority contested on the grounds that it amounted to the issuing of _ultra vires_ powers to the Home Secretary, i.e., that they would be empowered to utilise powers beyond that which their position ought entail.

### Issues

Was the Home Secretary empowered to supply the crowd control equipment in question as part of their greater prerogative of keeping peace within the realm.

### Decision/Outcome

At first instance, the Court found for the claimant, with the view being held that prevention and management of threats to the peace did not require such strong Governmental intervention powers. This was overturned on appeal and it was subsequently recognised that Parliament held the prerogative power in determining the nation’s approach to disruption management, which it was entitled to delegate to the Home Secretary. Further, this prerogative should not be viewed as ‘surrendered’ simply because of ‘assent to the modern system of keeping the peace through the agency of independent police forces’ per Purchas LJ.

The case recognised a never-before discussed prerogative power; while creating prerogative powers violates precedent, it was found that this power had existed but had not been used. The court's decision was criticised; academic Robert Ward writes in the _[Cambridge Law Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Law_Journal "Cambridge Law Journal")_ that it has 

> "Full marks for creative thinking, but the result looks distinctly like that constitutional solecism, the recognition of a new prerogative … the impact of the prerogative power to maintain the peace is potentially so far-reaching as to make the decision look rather like a Pandora's box – from which a host of evils were loosed upon the world." (Ward, "Baton rounds and circulars" [1988] 2 CLJ 155 pp. 156–157)

Argument of Police Authority:
1. There was no mention in nineteenth-century textbooks or case law of a prerogative power to keep the peace. 
2. Whatever prerogative powers to keep the peace may have existed between 1688 and 1800 would have been superseded by any overlapping statutory provisions. s 4 of the Police Act 1964 granted police authorities the power to provide clothing and equipment to the police

Court of Appeal on each of these points:
1. Rejected; Nourse LJ:
> [The] scarcity of reference in the books to the prerogative of keeping the peace within the realm does not disprove that it exists. Rather it may point to an unspoken assumption that it does.
2. Court held that s 4 did not 'expressly grant a monopoly' in respect to equipment provision to the Police Authority, but created a situation in which the Police Authority's statutory power co-existed with the Home Secretary's prerogative power. Unlike the situation in *Laker*, the co-existence appeared to be contradictory rather than interlocking. The court is apparently suggesting that Parliament can only abolish or curtail the prerogative through express statutory provisions??

But post-GCHQ this is arguably unproblematic. Since the nature of the Crown's prerogative power to keep the peace, and the powers afforded to the Home Secretary by the Police Act 1964 is the same, whichever method the government chose to apply its preferred policies would receive the same degree of judicial scrutiny. 

Therefore, no longer seems to be any functionalist justification, from a rule of law perspective, for assuming that the grant of statutory powers impliedly suspends analogous prerogative authority. 

Northumbria vs royal prerogative: de Keyser no longer relevant, thinking about royal prerogative emanating from the throes of history. So the Act of Parliament always came later, so impliedly repeals (“abridges” to be PC) the prerogative power of the Crown.
