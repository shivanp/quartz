Oil fields in Burma had been destroyed by British forces during the Second World War. The law lords decided that compensation should be paid to Burmah Oil, on the basis that the destruction was equivalent to an act of requisitioning in wartime, for which compensation should be payable.

Following this judgment, however, Parliament passed the War Damage Act 1965, which exempted the Crown from paying compensation for property damage or destruction in war.
