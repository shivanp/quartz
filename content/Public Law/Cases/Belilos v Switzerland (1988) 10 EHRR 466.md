Switzerland had violated the European Convention of Human Rights 1950 Art.6(1) as the police board, which fined Mrs. Belilos for participating in an unauthorised demonstration, could not be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal. The Lausanne Police Board fined Mrs. Belilos for participating in an unauthorised demonstration in Lausanne. Her appeals were dismissed. She alleged that Switzerland was in breach of Art.6(1).

Held, that 

(1) Art.6(1) was violated; Mrs. Belilos could legitimately have doubts as to the independence and organisational impartiality of the police board; the single member of the police board was a civil servant, who was liable to move to other departments' duties; a member of the public would tend to regard him as a member of the police force subordinate to his superiors and loyal to his colleagues; further, the available forms of appeal were insufficient; 

(2) An "interpretative declaration" made by Switzerland could not be regarded as a "reservation" under Art.64 of the Convention as 
(i) reservations of a general kind were prohibited and 
(ii) States were obliged, when making a reservation, to append a brief statement of the law in issue.
