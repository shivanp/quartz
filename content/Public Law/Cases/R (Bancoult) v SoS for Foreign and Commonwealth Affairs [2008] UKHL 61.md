Concerned the Chagossian people, the indigenous inhabitants of the British Indian Ocean Territory ('BIOT'), who had been removed from their home islands in the 1960s and 1970s, so that the main island, Diego Garcia, could be used as a United States military base.

In the Court of Appeal, which found for Bancoult, Sedley LJ stated that:

This issue has been the subject of protracted litigation and considerable criticism academically, as well as disagreement within the judiciary â€“ it is notable that there was only a 3-2 majority judgment in the end in favour of the Foreign Secretary in the House of Lords, with Lord Bingham finding against the government.

The majority effectively deferred to the government in stressing that it was a matter of executive competence as to what was conducive to the 'peace, order, and good government of the BIOT', as required in the original Order in Council which established the Territory in 1965.

Nevertheless, it was significant that this highly contentious political decision was seen as justiciable in spite of predictable government arguments to the contrary.
