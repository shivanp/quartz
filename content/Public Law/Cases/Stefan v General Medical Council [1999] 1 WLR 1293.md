Held, that, whilst there was no express or implied provision in either the [Medical Act 1983](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60244930E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4467a7ba20a46528ef3cebde9a1cac5&contextData=(sc.Default)) or the [General Medical Council Health Committee (Procedure) Rules Order of Council 1987](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7E011781E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4467a7ba20a46528ef3cebde9a1cac5&contextData=(sc.Default)), as amended, which placed the health committee of the General Medical Council under a duty to give reasons for its decisions, the judicial character of the committee and the fact that its decisions were open to appeal and were concerned with a doctor's fitness to work as a registered practitioner led to the conclusion that in all cases there was a common law obligation on the committee to provide at least a short statement of the reasons on which its decision was founded.
