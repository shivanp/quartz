The court acknowledged, in view of the operational choices that must be made in terms of priorities and resources, that the positive obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an excessive burden on states and public authorities. It was found, on the facts, that the police could not be taken to have known that the lives of the Osman family were at real and immediate risk from the perpetrator who shot and killed Mr Osman. There was, therefore, no breach of article 2.

---

O, a teenage boy, was seriously injured and his father, F, was killed after being shot by P, O's former teacher, who had become obsessed by O. Prior to the shooting, a number of disturbing incidents had occurred, including damage to O's home, in respect of which P had been interviewed by the school authorities and the police. P, who had also shot and injured a deputy headmaster and killed his son, was convicted of manslaughter. O and his mother, M, brought an action for negligence against the police in respect of their conduct of the investigation into P's activities, but the Court of Appeal ordered the action to be struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause of action on the ground that, following the House of Lords' ruling in _[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] A.C. 53, [1988] 4 WLUK 228](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC049A400E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=31b8c760422a4e3a88d5c7836f59e14b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , for reasons of public policy, no action in negligence could lie against the police in respect of the investigation and suppression of crime. O and M applied to the ECHR, contending that the state had failed to protect the lives of O and F and to protect the family from harassment contrary to the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.2 and Art.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1B58031DEC86485FA3AEEFBD8980CD10/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=31b8c760422a4e3a88d5c7836f59e14b&contextData=(sc.Default)) , and that O and M had been denied access to a court in respect of that failure, contrary to Art.6(1).

Held, that 

(1) there had been no violation of Art.2. The state was not in breach of its positive obligation to take preventative measures to protect an individual whose life was at risk from another, as the requirement that the police knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate threat to O and F's lives from P was not met, since none of the incidents prior to the shootings were life-threatening, there was no proof that P was responsible for those acts and there was no evidence that P was mentally ill or prone to violence; 

(2) for the same reasons the state was not in breach its positive obligations under Art.8, and 

(3) there had been a violation of Art.6(1). The fact that the Court of Appeal, in applying the exclusionary rule in Hill , dismissed O and M's claim as disclosing no cause of action did not preclude the application of Art.6(1). The rule in Hill , which appeared to act as an absolute defence to an action in negligence and thereby prevented a court considering the competing public interests in a case before it, constituted a disproportionate interference with a person's right to have a determination on the merits of an action against the police in a deserving case in breach of Art.6(1).
