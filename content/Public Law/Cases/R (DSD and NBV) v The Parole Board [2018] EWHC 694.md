**Facts:** The case involved a challenge by a number of interested parties to the decision by the Parole Board to release the convicted rapist and former taxi-driver, John Radford, (previously known as John Worboys).

**Held:** The court accepted that the Board had not acted irrationally during the parole hearing, in failing to probe the evidence presented to it rather more thoroughly than it had done. However, it did find that the Board had acted irrationally by failing to follow this up by making further inquiries, given the evidence it possessed of significant further criminal offending that had been carried out by Worboys. This evidence was seen as ‘so obviously material’ that no reasonable Parole Board should have failed to carry out further investigations before making its final decision.
