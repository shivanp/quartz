The Secretary of State for Transport concluded that a Romanian organisation was in breach of the condition requiring it to ensure compliance with the Romanian Civil Aviation Authority's licence requirements. The organisation's permit to operate charter flights to and from the UK was provisionally suspended. The Queen's Bench Division held that the requirement of natural justice that a party affected by an administrative action should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case could be waived where the action contemplated was merely the provisional suspension of a licence or permit in an emergency situation which might result in the loss of many lives if action was not taken. The Secretary had good cause for alarm about the competence of the organisation's pilots and the safety of aircraft operated by it and passengers flying in them. Accordingly, he was justified in taking swift action to suspend the organisation's permit provisionally pending further inquiry.
