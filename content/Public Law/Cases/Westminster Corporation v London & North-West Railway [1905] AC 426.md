Facts:

Westminster Corporation, a local authority, constructed public lavatories and other sanitary conveniences under the ground of the Parliament Street. On the one side of the Parliament Street is a building owned by the claimant railway company. The railway company sought to have the lavatories removed. On trial court found that due to some mistake, the corporation encroached on the footway. 

Issues:

The first instance judge, Joyce J, ordered the removal of encroachment but made no order about the costs. Court of Appeal reversed his decision and therefore, plaintiffs appealed.

Held:

In Westminster Corporation v London & North Western Railway, the House of Lords allowed an appeal. Lord James dissented. Lord Macnaghten held that :’apart from the encroachment on the footway, it is impossible to contend that the work is in excess of what was authorized by the Act of 1891 (Public Health (London) Act).’ As to whether the decision of contruction was made in good or bad faith, Lord Macnaghten concluded: ‘I entirely agree with Joyce J. that the primary object of the council was the construction of the conveniences with the requisite and proper means of approach thereto and exit therefrom.’ Since the decision was made bona fide and not in excess of the local authority’s powers, the claimants’ appeal was successful.
