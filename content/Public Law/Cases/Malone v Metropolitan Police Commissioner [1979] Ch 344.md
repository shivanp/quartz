Malone was charged with handling stolen property. The prosecution admitted that there had been prior interception of his telephone conversations. Malone sought declarations against the Metropolitan Police Commissioner ('MPC') to the effect that the police conduct was unlawful.

The Court found for the MPC and held, in summary:

• There was no prohibition on the interception of telephone calls in English law.
• There was no right to privacy in English law. (The European Convention on Human Rights was at that time not directly enforceable in English law).

> "No new right in the law, fully-fledged with all the appropriate safeguards, can spring from the head of a judge deciding a particular case: only Parliament can create such a right." (per Sir Robert Megarry, VC).
