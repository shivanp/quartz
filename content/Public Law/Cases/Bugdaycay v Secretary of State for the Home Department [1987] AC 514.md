### Summary

A court will not determine a refugee's status. A visitor from convention country A may seek asylum in convention country B from repatriation to country C in case of doubt as to how far A observes the convention.

### Abstract

The prohibition against appeals against refusal of leave to enter by a person in the UK contained in the [Immigration Act 1971 s.13(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0D6E2A00E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a1694c3fe064ba0966f4202222aebe8&contextData=(sc.Search)) extends to persons claiming refugee status. There were four consolidated appeals: in the first three the immigrants sought political asylum as refugees having lied to immigration officers to gain entry to the UK, and then remained here for a long period of time. They were treated as illegal immigrants under s.33(1) of the Immigrant Act 1971. In the fourth appeal, the immigrant appealed for asylum on the ground that on his return he would be killed and had a statement from an African Consular official in support. The Secretary of State did not attempt to verify the statement, but refused leave on the ground that he was not a genuine refugee.

### Held

Judgment accordingly.

(1) So far as the prior three were concerned, whether they were entitled to asylum fell to be determined by the immigration officers and the Secretary of State, and a claim to refugee status was no exception to the prohibitions against appeals under s.13(3) of the Immigration Act 1971; 

(2) in the fourth appeal, although the question of whether or not there was a danger was exclusively for the Secretary of State, the question had not been adequately considered, and the order to remove the immigrant would be quashed (_[Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 K.B. 223, [1947] 11 WLUK 26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I68410501E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a1694c3fe064ba0966f4202222aebe8&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied; _[R. v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p.
