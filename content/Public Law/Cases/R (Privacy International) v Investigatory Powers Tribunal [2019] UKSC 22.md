## Summary
The judicial review jurisdiction of the High Court was not excluded by the ouster clause contained in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 s.67(8) in relation to decisions of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.

## Abstract
The appellant, Privacy International, appealed against a ruling that decisions of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) were not amenable to judicial review.

The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 s.67(8) provided as follows: 
>“Except to such extent as the Secretary of State may by order otherwise provide, determinations, awards and other decisions of the Tribunal (including decisions as to whether they have jurisdiction) shall not be subject to appeal or be liable to be questioned in any court”. 

In 2016, the IPT had given a judgment (Privacy International v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2016] Info. T.L.R. 71, [2016] 2 WLUK 351) about the correct interpretation of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 s.5. The appellant obtained permission to seek judicial review of that decision, but the High Court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the claim. It found that s.67(8) prohibited judicial review of the decision, and the Court of Appeal upheld that ruling.

The issues were 
(1) whether s.67(8) of the 2000 Act ousted the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a judgment of the IPT for error of law; 
(2) whether, and if so, in accordance with what principles, Parliament might by statute oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court to quash the decision of an inferior court or tribunal of limited statutory jurisdiction.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

Did s.67(8) oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court? (Lords Sumption, Reed and Wilson dissenting) The court reviewed the authorities concerning the supervisory role of the High Court and its relationship with other adjudicative bodies (see paras 31-101 of judgment). 

The decision in Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 2 A.C. 147, [1968] 12 WLUK 81 had been interpreted as confirming first that there was a strong presumption against statutory exclusion of review by the High Court of any decision of an inferior court or tribunal treated as made without jurisdiction and so a “nullity”, and second that a decision which was vitiated by error of law was, or was to be treated as, made without jurisdiction and so a nullity. 

The correct interpretation of s.67(8) had to be informed by the close parallel with the provision under review in Anisminic. The drafter could have had no serious doubt about the far-reaching effect of that decision: a determination vitiated by any error of law, jurisdictional or not, was to be treated as no determination at all. The reference to such a determination was to be read as a reference only to a legally valid determination. The common law presumption against ouster was critically important. 

If the IPT's decision were found to have been reached on an erroneous interpretation of s.5 of the 1994 Act, the words in parenthesis in s.67(8) would not save it from intervention by the courts. The exclusion contained in the words in parentheses applied only to a legally valid decision relating to jurisdiction. That did not mean that the words were otiose: there would be decisions as to jurisdiction which might well involve issues of fact to which the exclusion could be said to apply without engaging the presumption against ouster. In any event, judicial review could only be excluded by the most clear and explicit words. A more explicit formula might have excluded challenges to any determination or “purported” determination as a nullity by reason of lack of jurisdiction, error or law or any other matter. 

Further, in the case of the IPT, the potential for overlap with legal issues which might be considered by the ordinary courts made it all the more important that it was not able to develop its own “local law” without scope for further review, Anisminic,O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] 2 A.C. 237, [1982] 11 WLUK 222 and R. (on the application of Cart) v Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28, [2012] 1 A.C. 663, [2011] 6 WLUK 519 followed (paras 43, 54, 105, 107, 109-112).

(Per Lord Sumption) The effect of s.67(8) was simply to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a challenge to the IPT's decisions on the merits. It excluded judicial review on grounds which would be tantamount to an appeal. The IPT acted as a court. Its function was to exercise powers of judicial review which would otherwise have been exercisable by the High Court. The rule of law was sufficiently vindicated by the judicial character of the tribunal. For that reason, s.67(8) was not an ouster of any jurisdiction which constitutional principle required the High Court to have (para.172).

(Obiter) Did Parliament have power to oust the supervisory jurisdiction of High Court? (Per Lord Carnwath (Lord Kerr and Lady Hale agreeing, Lords Lloyd-Jones, Reed and Sumption declining to give a view, Lord Wilson dissenting)) 

It was strictly unnecessary to determine the second issue, but some comment might be of value. There was no disagreement about the need for an independent judicial interpretation of a question of legal interpretation on a point directly within the apparent scope of the IPT's statutory remit. The dispute was as to the power of the legislature, consistently with the rule of law, to entrust that task to a judicial body such as the IPT, free from any possibility of review by the ordinary courts. It was ultimately for the courts, not the legislature, to determine the limits set by the rule of law to the power to exclude review. 

That was a natural application of the constitutional principle of the rule of law, and an essential counterpart to Parliament's power to make law. There was a strong case for holding that, consistently with the rule of law, binding effect could not be given to a clause which purported wholly to exclude the supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court to review a decision of an inferior court or tribunal, whether for excess or abuse of jurisdiction, or error of law, Cart considered. In all cases, it should remain ultimately a matter for the court to determine the extent to which such a clause should be upheld, having regard to its purpose and statutory context, and the nature and importance of the legal issue in question. It was also a matter for the court to determine the level of scrutiny required by the rule of law (paras 113, 127, 131-132, 144).

The minority of judges said that this was a specialist tribunal considering an area of national security. Why should we challenge this?

Only the Supreme Court by a slim majority decided not to follow the ouster clause.
