**Facts:**

A fisherman, registered in Norway, was prosecuted in Dornoch Sheriff Court for using a particular method to fish in the Moray Firth. However, he objected to the conviction on the ground that was that he was not subject the court’s jurisdiction as he was a foreigner. Further, he held statute should be construed impliedly. Therefore, the ban on fishing in Moray Firth should only apply to British fishermen.

**Issue:** 

Above all, did the Act only apply to British fishermen?

**Held:** 

In Mortensen v Peters, the fisherman’s defence failed. The court held that the Act applied to British and foreign fishermen. The defendant was also subject to jurisdiction of Dornoch Sheriff Court and therefore, his conviction and sentence were lawful. This case also indicates Parliament’s sovereignty.
