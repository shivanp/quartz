M, an army sergeant, had pleaded guilty before a court martial to a civil offence of wounding, but had adduced evidence that his 20 years of service had been otherwise exemplary and that the offence was completely out of character, being due either wholly or partly to the effects of taking an antimalarial drug. M applied for judicial review of the court martial's decision to reject his evidence on the cause of his behaviour and to sentence him to six months' imprisonment, reduction to the ranks and dismissal from the army. Neither the court martial nor the confirming officer and reviewing authorities who had rejected M's appeals gave any reasons for their decisions.

Held, allowing the application, that while the [Armed Forces Act 1996](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FC44EE0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c5052287642e4d6e893c0b1f9a5f6b8f&contextData=(sc.Default)) had effected a number of changes to court martial procedures, at the relevant time there was no statutory provision for the giving of reasons nor any right to apply for leave to appeal against sentence to the Courts Martial Appeal Court. While there was no general duty in law for decision making bodies to give reasons, in some cases fairness would require that reasons were given, although an application for judicial review would be unlikely to succeed where the reasons for the decision could be readily inferred or where the outcome of the case was inevitable. However, in the instant case, fairness demanded that the court martial give reasons for rejecting M's evidence and for sentencing him to imprisonment, rather than detention, which would not have necessitated M's dismissal from the army. The decisions would be quashed.
