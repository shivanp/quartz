**Facts:** After a planning application to build houses was refused, a public inquiry was set up, and listed for three days. One of the objectors was to present evidence on the second day, but when he turned up to do so, he found that the hearing had been closed on the previous day. A complaint was made to the Secretary of State who, without consultation, ordered a completely fresh inquiry. The developers applied for judicial review of the decision because of the delays this would cause.

**Held:** The Secretary of Stateâ€™s decision was so unreasonable as to verge on the irrational because there was no logical reason why the objector's views could not have been considered in writing.

A local inquiry was set up following the refusal of planning permission to F. It was arranged that the local ratepayers should give evidence of their objections on the second day of the inquiry. However, the inquiry was closed at the end of the first day. Following representations to the Secretary of State, a new inquiry was ordered. F applied for judicial review of that decision.

Held: Application granted. The Secretary of State failed to explain to the ratepayers' association that closure of the inquiry was due to innocent oversight or to consider alternative methods of receiving their evidence. Further, the Secretary of State failed to obtain views regarding reopening the inquiry from the other parties involved nor to take into account the fact that the local elected representatives supported the application for judicial review. These failures were serious and rendered his decision unreasonable.
