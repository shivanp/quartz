Claims were made as regards deaths of alleged terrorists in clashes with the UK armed forces and police. In some cases the investigations necessary to justify the taking of life had been inadequate. Statements made to the inquiry as to the circumstances of the deaths had not been subject to cross examination.  

Held: The right to life is the most fundamental of human rights, and no derogation is to be allowed outside times of war. Where the circumstances of a death are exclusively within the power of the authorities, the burden of proof could be regarded as falling on the authorities. The right could be infringed by a failure to investigate such deaths properly. The inadequacies were such as to lead the court to conclude that that the right to life had been infringed. ‘there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure accountability in practice as well as in theory. The degree of public scrutiny required may well vary from case to case. In all cases, however, the next-of-kin of the victim must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests.’
