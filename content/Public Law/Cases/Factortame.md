This involved a dispute between the Secretary of State for Transport and a number of companies, headed by Factortame Ltd, over the application of restrictive provisions in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988.

The UK government had introduced this legislation specifically to cut back on a practice known as "quota hopping" which was seen as damaging to the UK's national fishing industry, as it allowed foreign-based ships to take advantage of UK fish quotas, if the companies were registered in the UK.

## Facts

The applicant companies, which were incorporated under UK law, owned 95 fishing vessels. They were mainly owned and managed by Spanish nationals, but their vessels had previously been registered as British under an Act of 1894.

When the law was changed with the passing of the Merchant Shipping Act ('MSA') 1988, these vessels had to be re-registered.

The applicantsâ€™ vessels failed to qualify under the new regime because they were largely managed and controlled from Spain. The companies therefore sought to challenge the legality of the relevant new statutory provisions on the ground that they contravened the provisions of the EEC Treaty and other aspects of EU law, as incorporated by the ECA 1972.

Unlike in the earlier line of cases, where it had generally been possible for EU law and UK law to be harmonised, this was not an option in relation to the MSA 1988.

This was because the new statute operated in direct contravention of key principles in EU law, notably freedom of establishment.

Initially, the law lords refused the granting of interim financial relief to the companies, as they did not believe they had jurisdiction in the circumstances where domestic law appeared to preclude it.

The matter was then referred to the ECJ for a ruling.
