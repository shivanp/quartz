The local authority ordered the compulsory purchase of 23 acres of land consisting of a large house and 35 acres of land surrounding it pursuant to Pt V of the [Housing Act 1936](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251936_51a_Title%25&A=0.41235479508015294&backKey=20_T437047069&service=citation&ersKey=23_T437047060&langcountry=GB). The owners expressed their objections under s 72 of the Act claiming that it was part of a park. The minister affirmed the order after conducting an inquiry. The owners filed a motion under the RSC Ord 55b, r 71 asking that the order be quashed as being outside the powers of the Act. 

The Court of Appeal held that the word 'park'; in that section bore, not its original legal meaning, but its wider popular meaning. Land did not cease to be parkland merely because it was let for grazing. In the instant case, the land in question was part of a park. The compulsory order for its purchase was not within the powers given by the Act, and there was no jurisdiction to make or confirm such an order. Therefore, the order of the minister would be quashed.
