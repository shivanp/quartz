A, a citizen of Bangladesh, appealed against a decision ([1998] Imm. A.R. 375) refusing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Secretary of State refusing leave to remain on the basis of marriage. Having entered the UK on a false passport he married here in 1995 and his wife had indefinite leave to remain, a daughter was born in 1996. The refusal, based on Home Office Policy DP/3/96, was due to the fact that the marriage had not subsisted for more than two years before enforcement action commenced and the decision letter stated that, as the family had been invited to return together to Bangladesh, the family unit would not be split. A contended that the decision breached the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I13AEBA7190CB4FD6878845F048D2A987/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4b56838f39f441868e89131fb74dea86&contextData=(sc.Default)), arguing that, as it was not part of domestic law, it should be accorded greater effect in the exercise of a discretion under prerogative power than under a statutory discretion, and it was accepted that the Secretary of State would be acting under prerogative powers if granting an extra statutory concession under policy DP/3/96 or its predecessor, policy DP/2/93, by virtue of the [Immigration Act 1971 s.33(5)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0DB08A30E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4b56838f39f441868e89131fb74dea86&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, dismissing the appeal, that in making the policies the Secretary of State had clearly stated his approach to such matters and it could not be said that by entering into a treaty the executive would create legitmate expectations at odds with its own policies. The fact that the Secretary of State exercised his discretion exceptionally in ways contrary to written policy showed that the Secretary of State had not fettered his discretion, _[R. v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p.
