### Summary

The DPP had no statutory power to give an undertaking not to prosecute under the Suicide Act 1961 s.2(1) the husband of P, a terminally ill patient, if he were to assist P's suicide and any possible interference with P's Convention rights stemming from the existence of that criminal offence was a legitimate and proportionate response.

### Abstract

P appealed against the refusal ([2001] EWHC Admin 788) of her application for judicial review of the DPP's refusal to grant her husband immunity from prosecution if he assisted her suicide. P suffered from motor neurone disease, a terminal illness. She wished to end her life prematurely so as to avoid the inevitable pain and indignity she would have to bear in the final stages of her condition. Although she was mentally competent her physical disabilities prevented her ending her own life. Her husband was prepared to assist her suicide provided he received an undertaking from the DPP that he would not be prosecuted under the [Suicide Act 1961 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8B9E3330E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7dcef581457047b7bae549268e7ee163&contextData=(sc.Default)) . P contended that s.2 of the 1961 Act, by making her husband's complicity in her suicide a criminal offence infringed her rights under the [Human Rights Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FB840F0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7dcef581457047b7bae549268e7ee163&contextData=(sc.Default)) Sch.1 Part I Art.2, Art.3, and Art.8.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that 

(1) the DPP had no power to give an undertaking not to prosecute in respect of a crime to be committed in the future. Any such undertaking would be a breach of the prohibition, on the suspension or execution of laws without Parliament's consent, contained in the Bill of Rights 1688. Any possible interference with P's Convention rights was legitimate and proportionate; 

(2) Art.2 did not confer a right to die. To establish a breach of her right under Art.2, P would have had to have shown not merely that allowing assisted suicide was not a breach of Art.2, but, that failing to allow it was, and 

(3) failure to provide proleptic immunity did not fall within the negative prohibition in Art.3. P's suffering was the consequence of her disease and not the DPP's decision. The state was not in breach of any positive obligation under Art.3 or of Art.8 in failing to decriminalise assisted suicide.
