### Summary

The "starring system" introduced by the Court of Appeal giving the trial judge the power to identify essential milestones in a care plan requiring the local authority to take action if they were not achieved within a reasonable time was contrary to the principle of non intervention by the court under the Children Act 1989. The 1989 Act was not incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8.

### Abstract

Two local authorities appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal ([2001] EWCA Civ 757, [2001] 2 F.L.R. 582, [2001] C.L.Y. 2562) that the court had the power to identify essential milestones in a care plan and to require local authorities to take action if they were not achieved within a certain time. The issue before the House was whether such a "starring system" could be justified as a legitimate interpretation of the [Children Act 1989](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FF1A070E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e18c64fc196b4180a106478598b35ae4&contextData=(sc.Default)) pursuant to the [Human Rights Act 1998 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B25DFF0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e18c64fc196b4180a106478598b35ae4&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, dismissing the appeal in the first case and allowing the appeal in part in the second case, that the 1998 Act reiterated the constitutional boundaries circumscribing the interpretative role of the judiciary. It was a cardinal principle of the 1989 Act that the courts were not empowered to intervene in the discharge of a local authority's parental responsibilities under a final care order. Given that the 1989 Act contained no provision which could be interpreted so as to confer the supervisory function proposed in the court below, it was clear that the judicial innovation within the Court of Appeal's decision had passed beyond the boundaries of interpretation. The introduction of the new system went far beyond the concept of judicial remedy provided by s.7 and s.8 of the 1998 Act. The effect of the decision was potentially to deprive a parent of an effective remedy where the mishandling of a child's care by a local authority constituted a breach of the parent's rights under Sch.1 Part I Art.8 of the 1998 Act. However, the failure to provide a remedy did not, of itself, constitute a breach of Art.8 rights and, in spite of possible infringements to a parent's rights under Art.6, the Court of Appeal provided an appropriate forum for parents to express their concerns. Furthermore, having regard to the guidelines issued by the Court of Appeal giving judges a wider discretion in making interim care orders, it was appropriate in deciding whether to make a care order that the court normally have before it a care plan which was sufficiently firm and particularised for all concerned to have a reasonably clear picture of the likely way ahead for the foreseeable future. However, in the light of the inevitable uncertainties inherent in the process, it was necessary to maintain a proper balance between the need to determine the appropriateness of the care plan and the avoidance of overzealous investigation into matters which were properly within the administrative discretion of the local authority, _[J (Minors) (Care: Care Plan), Re [1994] 1 F.L.R. 253, [1993] 10 WLUK 248](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6B05CC80E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e18c64fc196b4180a106478598b35ae4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed.

The Court of Appeal erred in propounding a new procedure, by which at the trial of care proceedings, the essential milestones of a care plan would be identified and elevated to 'starred' status.

 The milestones are laid down by the court. If these are not hit, the court can step in. 

In the Court of Appeal, Lady Justice Hale gave the lead judgment. They used the approach from [[R v A (Complainant's Sexual History) [2001] UKHL 25]]. 

The House of Lords said, please don't do this. There would be big practical ramifications. Legislature would need to assess this, not the court through an interpretation. Also, the fact that the court would be stepping in is an issue. Lords said it was contrary to a fundamental feature of the Children's Care Act, which was that the local authority alone looks after children, and the court does not interfere unless the LA does something illegal. This is a 'cardinal principle' of the Care Act. 

What provision is being interpreted? Trick question: Court of Appeal had not identified any provision in the statute, they can't just read in a new scheme to the whole statute. So for these reasons, Court of Appeal went too far. 

Judgment of Lord Steyn is never criticised, only its application by the Court of Appeal. 

Lady Hale cares about these kids. Before she was a judge, she was an academic lawyer specialising in family law. She was on the commission which created the Children Act, so she's doing this as one of the architects of the Children's Act in the first place. 

HoL decided that there was no violation of the rights. But specifically dealt with CoA's approach too.
