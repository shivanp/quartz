The case concerned the death of an 18-year-old, who was HIV positive and suffering from a severe mental disability, in a neuropsychiatric hospital. In this case the application was lodged by CLR, a non-governmental organisation, on his behalf even though this organisation was not itself a victim of the alleged violations.
