The court has jurisdiction to review the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy. In 1952 B's brother (D) was convicted with a co-accused of the murder of a policeman. The co-accused, aged 16, who fired the fatal shot, received life imprisonment, D was hanged. In 1992 the Secretary of State for the Home Department refused a posthumous free pardon, on the grounds that it ought not to be given where the innocence of the deceased had not been established. B applied for judicial review, contending that the Secretary of State for the Home Department had erred in his approach to the issue.

Held, allowing the application and inviting the Secretary of State for the Home Department to reconsider his decision, that 
(1) the court had jurisdiction to review the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy; 
(2) his decision was flawed in that he had failed to recognise that the prerogative could be exercised in many different circumstances, and he had failed to consider the form of the pardon that might be appropriate (_[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] A.C. 374, [1984] 11 WLUK 193](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8F0974B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f791143cb5434c6a8550117c921d4ce1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
