T, a child who was receiving five hours of home tuition per week as she was unable to attend school due to ill health, brought proceedings through her mother and next friend for judicial review of ESCC's decision in 1996 to set a maximum of three hours per week home tuition and to reduce T's hours accordingly. ESCC's decision, taken in the light of financial constraints, was quashed on the ground that, in making arrangements for "suitable education" under the [Education Act 1993 s.298(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I490D5641E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=08e9c5bc5c0b4139ae9b2e529514961c&contextData=(sc.Default)) , a local education authority must determine what was suitable by reference only to the educational needs of the child. T appealed against a Court of Appeal ruling ([1997] 3 W.L.R. 884, [1997] C.L.Y. 2089) allowing ESCC's appeal and holding that ESCC was entitled to take available resources into account in determining what was "suitable education".

Held, allowing the appeal, that a local authority, faced with the need to make savings by reducing expenditure, had to make difficult decisions in determining priorities with scarce resources, but the provision of suitable education to children who were ill was not an area in which discretion could be exercised. In enacting s.298(1), Parliament had not conferred a power but had clearly imposed a duty and, whilst other parts of the 1993 Act made express reference to the efficient use of resources, the factors in s.298(7) relevant to the definition of "suitable education" related exclusively to educational considerations and there was nothing to indicate that resources were to be taken into account. Thus, ESCC's decision to reduce T's hours of home tuition was unlawful.
