O and C appealed against the decision that immigration inspectors made lawful decisions to deport them under the [Immigration Act 1971 s.35(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0DB93CC0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=42d176fa9d2c4394860131a1600e6a02&contextData=(sc.Default)) (Times, March 16, 1990). They sought judicial review of the accepted practice of allowing immigration inspectors to decide to deport an immigrant on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.

Held: Appeal dismissed. It was impractical for the Secretary of State for the Home Department to investigate each case of deportation individually. The 1988 Act ensured that an inspector of requisite experience could make a decision to deport which the Secretary of State for the Home Department reviewed before signing the deportation order. Thus, the Secretary of State for the Home Department could lawfully delegate this power first recognised in _[Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E.R. 560, [1943] 10 WLUK 5](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7186580E57011DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=42d176fa9d2c4394860131a1600e6a02&contextData=(sc.Default))_ . The Secretary of State for the Home Department remained ultimately responsible and inspectors could not take such decisions where they were personally involved in an individual case.
