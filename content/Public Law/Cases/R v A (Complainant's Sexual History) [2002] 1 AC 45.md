The Defendant claimed that his Article 6 rights to a fair trial were compromised by very restrictive provisions that had been introduced in s. 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 ('YJCEA').

These had the apparent effect of preventing him from bringing in any evidence about the complainant's past sexual history, which he needed to do in order to put forward his defence of consent.

Lord Steyn, who gave the lead judgment, emphasised that the interpretative obligation in s. 3(1) of the HRA 1998 was a strong one. He gave effect to this by reading a new provision into s. 41 of the 1999 Act that evidence or questioning, which was required to ensure a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR, should not be treated as inadmissible.

### Summary

The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 s.41(3)(c) should be construed where necessary by having regard to the interpretative obligation under the Human Rights Act 1998 s.3 and by giving consideration to the need to seek to protect a complainant from indignity and humiliating questions. Evidence of a complainant's previous sexual history was admissible where that evidence, and questioning concerning it, was so relevant to the issue of consent that by not including it the fairness of the trial would be brought into question.

### Abstract

Following the decision of the Court of Appeal ([2001] EWCA Crim 4) as to the admissibility of evidence, in a rape trial, concerning the alleged previous sexual relationship between a complainant and a defendant in relation to the issue of consent, the House of Lords was asked to determine whether the exclusion of such evidence under the [Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 s.41](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7F617160E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ef3527f0e24849798abc3019a678a004&contextData=(sc.Default)) would contravene a defendant's right to a fair trial under the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ef3527f0e24849798abc3019a678a004&contextData=(sc.Default)) .

Held, dismissing the appeal, that s.41(3)(c) of the 1999 Act should be construed where necessary by having regard to the interpretative obligation under s.3 of the 1998 Act and by giving consideration to the need to seek to protect a complainant from indignity and humiliating questions. Evidence of a complainant's previous sexual history was admissible where that evidence, and questioning concerning it, was so relevant to the issue of consent that by not including it the fairness of the trial would be brought into question. The relevance of the previous sexual experience was a matter for the trial judge to determine. On the basis of this approach it was unnecessary for the House to answer the certified question.
