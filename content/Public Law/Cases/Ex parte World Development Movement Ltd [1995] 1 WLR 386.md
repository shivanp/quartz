### Abstract

The question of legal standing is not to be treated as a preliminary issue but is to be taken in the context of the whole case. Once the court has determined that that particular conduct is within the statutory purpose, the weight to be given to competing factors is a matter for the Secretary of State. A British consortium sought aid and trade provision for a project to construct a hydro-electric power station on the Pergau river. Despite advice from the Overseas Development Administration that the project was an abuse of the overseas aid programme in that it was uneconomic and was not a sound development project, the Secretary of State decided to approve support for the project and the UK and Malaysian Governments signed a financial agreement. The applicants, a non-partisan pressure group, sought an assurance from the Secretary of State that no further funds for the project would be furnished, but he refused to give such an assurance. The applicants sought judicial review of the Secretary of State's decision to grant funding and to refuse to withhold outstanding payments.

Held, granting the application, that 

(1) that since standing went to jurisdiction it was not to be treated as a preliminary issue but was to be taken in the legal and factual context of the whole case; 

(2) the merits of the challenge were an important factor when considering standing and significant factors in support of the conclusion that the applicants had sufficient interest for the purposes of the application were the importance of vindicating the rule of law, the importance of the issue raised, the likely absence of any other responsible challenger, the nature of the breach of duty against which relief was sought and the prominent role of the applicants in giving advice, guidance and assistance regarding aid (_[R. v Inland Revenue Commissioners Ex p.

(3) it was for the court to determine on the evidence whether particular conduct was within the purpose of the [Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6035D560E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=87b40f2527744c3dadda86ad985e3bd2&contextData=(sc.Default)) but, once it was so determined, the weight to be given to competing factors was a matter for the Secretary of State; and 

(4) the power under the Act to furnish assistance related to economically sound development and, although the Secretary of State was entitled when making decisions whether to grant assistance under the Act to take into account political and economic considerations, on the evidence, no developmental promotion purpose within s.1 existed at the time the financial agreement was signed and the Secretary of State's decision was therefore unlawful.
