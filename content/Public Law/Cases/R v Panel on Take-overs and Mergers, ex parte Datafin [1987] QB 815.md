**Facts:** The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers was a self-regulatory body created by the financial services industry in the City of London. It was an unincorporated association with no legal personality and had no direct statutory powers.

**Held:** The Panel’s decision should be subject to judicial review. The court’s approach, reproduced later in the CPR, was that decisions, taken by bodies performing 'public law functions', could be subject to judicial review. **Lloyd LJ** did not fully explain what he meant by this type of function, but he pointed to the fact that the Panel regulated an important aspect of national, economic life and so deemed it to be exercising a governmental-type function. He stated:

> ‘If the source of power is a statute, or subordinate legislation under a statute, then clearly the body in question will be subject to judicial review … if the body is exercising a public law function, or if the exercise of its functions have public law consequences, then that may be sufficient to bring the body within the reach of judicial review’.

### Abstract

Decisions of the Panel on Take-overs and Mergers are susceptible to judicial review. A Co, who were bidding against B Co to take over X Co, complained to the Panel on Take-overs and Mergers that B Co were acting in breach of the City Code. A Co sought orders of mandamus and certiorari but the High Court refused on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.

Held, that the High Court had supervisory jurisdiction over any body performing public law duties, supported by public law sanctions, and under a duty to act judicially, whose power was not simply by consent of those over whom it was exercised. On the facts, the panel operated as an integral part of a governmental framework for the regulation of the City with statutory powers and penalties, and did not exist simply by consent of those whom it controlled; accordingly, the courts had power to interfere (_[R. v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board Ex p.
