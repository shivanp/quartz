## Summary

Immediate custodial sentences could be appropriate for non-violent crimes committed as part of a peaceful protest and such sentences did not breach ECHR art.10. In the instant case, however, the immediate custodial sentences imposed on three protesters who had sat on the cabs of lorries delivering equipment to a fracking site were manifestly excessive. Community orders with a significant requirement for unpaid work would have been appropriate.

## Abstract

The appellant protesters appealed against immediate custodial sentences imposed following their convictions for offences of public nuisance contrary to the common law.

The appellants had been protesting against an authorisation which had been granted to an oil and gas exploration company to begin fracking at a site near Blackpool. The appellants sat on top of the cabs of lorries, which had been delivering equipment to the site, for between two-and-a-half and three-and-a-half days. As a result of their actions, one of the carriageways of the road was blocked and substantial disruption was caused to thousands of people. The first two appellants were sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment, and the third was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. 

In passing sentence, the judge noted that each of the appellants was of good character, but found that the custody threshold had been crossed and that he could not suspend the sentences. His decision was based on 
(i) the widespread harm caused to many people as a result of the extended length of the protest; 
(ii) his evaluation that the appellants were culpable because they persevered in their protest despite it being obvious that the impact was severe; and 
(iii) the fact that the appellants were unrepentant and adhered to their underlying views and convictions.

It was the appellants' case that an immediate custodial sentence was never appropriate for a non-violent crime committed as part of a peaceful protest, and that such a sentence would breach ECHR art.10.

## Held

Appeals allowed.

Appropriateness of custodial sentences â€” It could not be said that those convicted of any offence in the course of peaceful protesting should not receive a custodial sentence. A wide range of offences could be committed in the course of peaceful protest, and those offences were of differing seriousness and carried various maximum sentences. 

The essential approach to sentencing remained in play and judges had to look at harm and culpability and consider the three aims of sentencing, namely punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation. The conscientious motives of protesters would be taken into account when they were sentenced for their offences, but there was in essence a bargain or **mutual understanding** operating in such cases. **A sense of proportion on the part of the offenders in avoiding excessive damage or inconvenience was matched by a relatively benign approach to sentencing**, R. v Jones (Margaret) [2006] UKHL 16, [2007] 1 A.C. 136, [2006] 3 WLUK 781 applied (see paras 32-34 of judgment). 

The UK valued peaceful protest, and the common law attached importance to the right to protest and free speech. The importance of freedom of speech and freedom of association was also reflected by ECHR art.10 and art.11, and direct action protests fell within the scope of those articles. The Strasbourg jurisprudence did not support the proposition that detention was necessarily disproportionate for conduct such as that in the instant case. On the contrary, the Strasbourg court had accepted as proportionate both immediate sentences of imprisonment and suspended sentences in cases where the conduct caused less harm and was less culpable. The underlying circumstances of peaceful protest were at the heart of the sentencing exercise; there were no bright lines, but particular caution attached to immediate custodial sentences, Taranenko v Russia (19554/05) 37 B.H.R.C. 285, [2014] 5 WLUK 514 considered (paras 37-43).

Appropriate sentences - Custody was only appropriate if the court considered that, in the light of all the circumstances, the offence was so serious that neither a fine nor a community sentence could be justified. Having regard to the good character of the appellants and the underlying motivation for their criminal behaviour, even taking into account the widespread disruption for which they were responsible, the custody threshold was not crossed. A community sentence, with a punitive element involving work or a curfew, would have been appropriate (paras 45, 52).

However, by the time the instant appeals came to be heard, the appellants had spent three weeks in custody, the equivalent of serving a sentence of six weeks. In those circumstances, it would not be appropriate to impose a community order with a punitive element. The time in custody represented adequate punishment. Accordingly, a conditional discharge would be imposed for two years. That sentence introduced no additional active element of punishment, but provided some protection to the public against repeat offending (para.54).
