The applicant's car collided with the vehicle of another, who sustained injuries. The police took a summons against the applicant for having driven his vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public. The firm of solicitors, which was acting for the injured person, claimed for damages against the applicant for the injuries received in the collision. At the hearing, the acting clerk to the justices was a member of the firm. At the conclusion of the evidence, the justices retired to consider a decision, the acting clerk retiring with them in case they should desire to be advised on any point of law. The justices convicted the applicant, and it was stated on affidavit that they came to that conclusion without consulting the acting clerk. The King's Bench Division held that the conviction should be quashed because it was improper for the acting clerk, having regard to his firm's relation to the case, to be present with the justices when they were considering their decision.
