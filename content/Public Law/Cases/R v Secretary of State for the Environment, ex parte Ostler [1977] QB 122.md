### Abstract

A person aggrieved by a proposed road scheme made under the Highways Act 1959 must apply to the High Court within six weeks of the date of publication of notice of confirmation thereof; the court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application made outside such time limit, whatever the grounds of the application. Stopping-up and compulsory purchase orders were confirmed by the Secretary of State in May 1974. 

In December 1975 the applicant applied to quash the orders, explaining his delay in objecting as being due to a belief that the scheme would not affect his premises and alleging that the orders were invalidated as contrary to natural justice by reason of a secret agreement made with another landowner which adversely affected the applicant. A preliminary objection was taken by the Secretary of State that the application was out of time, there being a six-week time limit upon such applications.

Held, that in each case the application was barred by the limitation period; that even if the decisions sought to be questioned were voidable, after expiry of the six-week period their validity could not be challenged.
