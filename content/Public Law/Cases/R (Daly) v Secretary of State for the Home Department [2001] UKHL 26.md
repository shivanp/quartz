### Summary

The Home Secretary's blanket policy requiring correspondence between a prisoner and his legal advisers to be examined in the prisoner's absence was unlawful and constituted a breach of the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8.1.

### Abstract

D, a long term prisoner, appealed against the refusal by the Court of Appeal ([1999] C.O.D. 388) of his application for judicial review of the blanket policy introduced by the Home Secretary which authorised cell searches in prisons and in particular, required correspondence between a prisoner and his legal advisers to be examined in the prisoner's absence. It was submitted that the examination of legal correspondence in a prisoner's absence was not authorised by the [Prison Act 1952 s.47(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I664DBD80E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1b86165647934501802b1012f8a4be01&contextData=(sc.Default)) and constituted a breach of the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1b86165647934501802b1012f8a4be01&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, allowing the appeal, that the blanket policy infringed D's common law right to legal professional privilege, _[R. v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p. Simms [1999] Q.B. 349, [1997] 12 WLUK 94](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I693310B0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1b86165647934501802b1012f8a4be01&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The only way in which a prisoner's right of access to legal advice and to communicate confidentially with a legal adviser could reasonably be curtailed would be by express words to that effect and that curtailment had to be justified. In the instant case, the infringement was greater than could be shown to be justified and no support for the intrusion could be found in either s.47(1) of the 1952 Act or in the 1998 Act. Lord Steyn observed that the comments of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, M.R. made in _[R. (on the application of Mahmood) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 1 W.L.R. 840, [2000] 12 WLUK 249](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7A424880E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1b86165647934501802b1012f8a4be01&contextData=(sc.Default))_ concerning the review of executive decisions that interfered with human rights required clarification. The intensity of review was greater under the proportionality approach. Whilst not exhaustive, he set out three concrete differences in approach.
