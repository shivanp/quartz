Jackson's case (as the Chairman of the Countryside Alliance) was that the Hunting Act 2005 — which banned fox-hunting — was invalid, because it had been passed under the accelerated procedure laid down in the Parliament Act (“PA”) of 1949.

The root of his case was that the 1949 Act was invalid because the House of Commons alone had amended the original Parliament Act of 1911.

Parliament Act 1911 allows the Commons to pass legislation if blocked for 2 years. Then in 1949, changed this to 1 year using their own procedure (?!).

This was huge because courts considering the validity of two Acts of Parliament. 

He argued that this was not permissible because there was an implied exception to the use of the procedure set down in the 1911 Act, which originally established an accelerated process for passing legislation that could involve bypassing the House of Lords.

This exception, he said, meant that a “delegate body” (i.e., a Parliament comprising only the Commons) could not increase its own powers on its own authority. It had not been able to do so, he reasoned, in 1949 and so the 1949 was effectively null and void.

**Jackson — obiter**

The law lords did not accept the main arguments put forward by Jackson — they found that the 1949 Act was a valid form of legislation and so the Hunting Act as well as other Acts passed under the terms of the 1949 Act procedure were entirely valid too.

However, in developing a number of obiter points, the court arrived at some more challenging ideas on the relationship between courts and Parliament.

Initially, as a spin-off from Jackson's argument about an 'implied exception' to the use of the PA procedure, the majority of the law lords made an important point about an implied exception that _they_ thought existed. This related to the democratic safeguard that had been written into the original PA 1911.

The issue mooted was whether it would be possible for a future House of Commons to extend its own lifetime (beyond the 5-year limit) by adopting a two-stage process using the accelerated PA procedure — i.e., bypassing the House of Lords on both occasions.

Firstly, by removing the express exception against doing this in s. 2(1) PA 1911, and then by passing an Act to increase the lifetime of the current Parliament to, say, 10 years?

The majority answer to this hypothetical but important question was that this would not be possible. In other words there was an implied exception to this extent (though not to the extent that Mr. Jackson argued.)

The reason given was that it was vital to maintain the very important democratic safeguard in s 2(1) by ensuring that the House of Commons could not extend its own time in power without being checked by the House of Lords as the second chamber.

#### Wider obiter discussion

Clear judicial concern about the potential constitutional dangers of a system in which a strong central executive can use its majority in Parliament to pass legislation that may undermine fundamental rights and values. Referred to by Lord Steyn as a “complaisant House of Commons”

Remains a key anxiety of the judiciary, and is reflected in the modern emphasis on protection of fundamental rights through the common law. 

Judges such as Steyn, Hale and Hope looked to the principle of the rule of law (in its modern substantive form) as the vital safeguard in establishing a balance in the constitution between its political and legal foundations. 

#### Lord Hope on Rule of Law

Saw the rule of law as having a key functional role in providing the necessary balance between the different bodies of state:

> “The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. The fact that your Lordships have been willing to hear this appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament’s legislative sovereignty.” 

It was seen as part of the court's role as 'guardians' of the rule of law to define these limits. 

> “Our constitution is dominated by the sovereignty of Parliament. But Parliamentary sovereignty is no longer, if it ever was, absolute. … It is no longer right to say that its freedom to legislate admits of no qualification whatever. Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament which Dicey derived from Coke and Blackstone is being qualified.”

#### Lord Steyn

The view that parliamentary sovereignty was not controlled was reflected more radically by Lord Steyn. Mooted the possibility of passing 'oppressive and wholly undemocratic legislation'. Warned that courts may have to consider whether to recognise such legislation, based on an alternative reading of constitutional balance. 

Steyn saw the principle of parliamentary supremacy as a product of common law. Remains an unorthodox view. 

> "The classic account given by Dicey of the doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament, pure and absolute as it was, can now be seen to be out of place in the modern United Kingdom. Nevertheless, the supremacy of Parliament is still the general principle of our constitution. It is a construct of the common law. The judges created this principle. If that is so, it is not unthinkable that circumstances could arise where the courts may have to qualify a principle established on a different hypothesis of constitutionalism. In exceptional circumstances involving an attempt to abolish judicial review or the ordinary role of the courts, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or a new Supreme Court may have to consider whether this is a constitutional fundamental which even a sovereign Parliament acting at the behest of a complaisant House of Commons cannot abolish."

---

 It is interesting that so much judicial oversight was applied to an argument that essentially questioned the validity of an Act of Parliament. However, the law lords, notably Lord Bingham as the senior judge, steered the emphasis away from any comparison with older “rules” such as that in Pickin v BRB. Instead he justified the case being fully heard because it ultimately boiled down to an exercise in statutory interpretation (of the original 1911 Parliament Act) which was the responsibility par excellence of the judiciary.
 
 Basically Lady Hale and Lord Steyn saying that in the future some form of entrenchment might be recognised, even if it isn't currently.
