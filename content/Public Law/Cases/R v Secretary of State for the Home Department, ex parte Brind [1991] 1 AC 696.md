Northern Ireland:

A direction of the Secretary of State prohibiting the broadcasting of direct speech from those representing proscribed terrorist organisations was not ultra vires. By directions issued under the [Broadcasting Act 1981](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I765B17B0A8E611DFAB80E46B36969239/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ac3d0d125cfe46f1a3ed66894cc5525e&contextData=(sc.Search)) and the licence and agreement the Secretary of State required broadcasters to refrain from broadcasting any matters by or from persons who represented proscribed terrorist organisations where the "matter" supported or encouraged support of the organisation. A, broadcasters, sought judicial review of the decision, arguing that it contravened the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38C9C0AD773A4385868CB431E132B1A7/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ac3d0d125cfe46f1a3ed66894cc5525e&contextData=(sc.Search)) and conflicted with their duty under the Act and the licence and agreement to preserve impartiality. The Divisional Court and Court of Appeal dismissed the application.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the Convention was not part of English law and the wording of the Act was clear so that there was no presumption that the Secretary of State had to exercise his powers in conformity with the Convention. It was not possible to say that the restrictions imposed were not justified by the public interest in combating terrorism, and so it could not be said that the Secretary of State exceeded his discretion or power (_[Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 K.B. 223, [1947] 11 WLUK 26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I68410501E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ac3d0d125cfe46f1a3ed66894cc5525e&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied).
