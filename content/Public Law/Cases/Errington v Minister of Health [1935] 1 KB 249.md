A local authority made a clearance order under s 1 of the Housing Act 1930, and submitted the order to the Minister of Health for confirmation. The owners objected. The Minister complied with the provisions of para of Sch 1 to the Act and held a public local inquiry. He considered objections not withdrawn and the report of the person who held the inquiry. In deciding whether or not he should confirm the clearance order, the Minister occupied a quasi-judicial function and did not consider any matters other than those mentioned in para 4 of Sch 1 to the Act. 

The Court of Appeal held that if the Minister held a private inquiry where the owners were not invited or considered ex parte statements with which the owners had no opportunity of dealing, he did not act according to the correct principle of justice. His confirmation would not be within the powers conferred on him. Thus, the owners would be entitled as persons aggrieved to have the order quashed.
