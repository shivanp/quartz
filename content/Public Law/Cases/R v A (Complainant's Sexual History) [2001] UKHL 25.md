#### Facts

The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, s. 41 was designed to restrict the circumstances in which evidence and questioning about a complainant's prior sexual history could be permitted in trials concerning sexual offences. The issue was whether this new provision prejudiced the defendant's right to a fair trial under article 6 of the ECHR.

#### Decision

The House of Lords held that s. 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 was incompatible with the right to a fair trial. As a consequence of their judgment, their Lordships went on to consider their obligations under s. 3, HRA.

Lord Steyn, who gave the lead judgment, advocated for a bold approach to interpretation using the new, s. 3 power under the HRA. He reasoned that:
> '[T]he interpretative obligation under section 3 of the 1998 Act is a strong one. It applies even if there is no ambiguity in the language, in the sense of the language being capable of two different meanings … Parliament specifically rejected the legislative model of requiring a reasonable interpretation. Section 3 places a duty on the court to strive to find a possible interpretation compatible with Convention rights … In accordance with the will of Parliament as reflected in section 3 it will sometimes be necessary to adopt an interpretation which linguistically may appear strained. The techniques to be used will not only involve the reading down of express language in a statute, but also the implication of provisions. A declaration of incompatibility is a measure of last resort. It must be avoided unless it is plainly impossible to do so.'

On this basis, Lord Steyn felt able to read an implied provision into s. 41 of the 1999 Act that evidence or questioning which is required to ensure a fair trial under Article 6, ECHR should be treated as admissible.

Lord Hope, though not dissenting, took a more cautious approach than Lord Steyn to the use of this new court power. His concern about a possible over-extension of the judicial role can be clearly seen in the following statement from his speech:
> ‘The rule of construction which section 3 lays down is quite unlike any previous rule of statutory interpretation. There is no need to identify any ambiguity or absurdity. Compatibility with Convention rights is the sole guiding principle. That is the paramount object which the rule seeks to achieve. But the rule is only a rule of interpretation. It does not entitle the judges to act as legislators.'

Lord Hope found it difficult to accept that it was permissible to read in the implied provision as advocated by Lord Steyn. In his view, the entire structure of s. 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 contradicted such an implied provision. He was more sympathetic to the idea that s. 41 could be read down to render it compatible, although he thought that it would be necessary to identify precisely what words were incompatible with article 6 and how those words were to be construed to make them compatible.

Under s 41(3)(c) of the [Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999,](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251999_23a_Title%25&A=0.3897798232738653&backKey=20_T471262133&service=citation&ersKey=23_T471262119&langcountry=GB) construed where necessary by applying the interpretative obligation under s 3 of the [Human Rights Act 1998,](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251998_42a_Title%25&A=0.35462258605487895&backKey=20_T471262133&service=citation&ersKey=23_T471262119&langcountry=GB) and due regard always being paid to the importance of seeking to protect the complainant from indignity and from humiliating questions, the test of admissibility was whether the evidence, and questioning relating to it, was nevertheless so relevant to the issue of consent that to exclude it would endanger the fairness of the trial under art 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. If that test was satisfied, the evidence should not be excluded.

In criminal trials, need to only sow reasonable doubt. Lawyers were effectively putting the complainant on trial. 1970s: law saying that permission of court must be sought before sexual history could be taken into account. But lawyers were good at this, so the statute tightened.

s 41(3)(c) says he can't disclose past sexual history with him. Argues breach of Art 6 – right to fair trial. HoL says it 'could be' a breach of Art 6. 

Lord Steyn: strong interpretative obligation, even if there is no ambiguous language. 

There is an age-old presumption for statutory interpretation that, when Parliament passes legislation, intend to comply with international obligations. But this only applied when language was ambiguous. This now goes further than the old presumption. 

Can read in implied provisions, or 'read down' provisions to read them narrowly. Focuses on:
1. Purpose is to stop peeps going to Strasbourg, so need a strong interpretation to stop people from doing that
2. We copied New Zealand's model, but they used the word reasonable. But we don't have 'reasonable' in s 3, meaning Parliament intended s 3 to be stronger. 

Lord Hope said Steyn was overstepping the constitutional boundary. Lord Hope only has a problem with the way of applying the strong approach in this case. Did not like that Steyn had read in a new provision, rather than narrowing the provision.
