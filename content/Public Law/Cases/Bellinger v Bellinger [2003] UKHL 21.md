#### Facts

This case concerned a person who had been born male but had undergone gender reassignment to become female. She had subsequently been through a marriage ceremony with a man, and the issue was whether the marriage certificate was valid.

The problem revolved around the use of the phrase ‘male and female’ in s. 11(c) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 which had been interpreted by the courts on the basis of the biological sex of a person at birth.

The ECtHR had already established in Goodwin v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 18 that the failure of the UK to recognise reassignment of gender for the purpose of marriage was a violation of Articles 8 and 12, ECHR. The issue which the House of Lords had to decide in Bellinger was whether it was possible under s. 3(1) to interpret the phrase ‘male and female’ in s. 11(c) of the 1973 Act as extending to those who had undergone gender reassignment.

#### Decision

The House of Lords held that it was not possible to use s. 3 to interpret s. 11(c) of the 1973 Act in this way. Lord Nicholls provided three reasons.

First, it was far from self-evident what criteria and procedures should be satisfied before a person can be legally recognised as having acquired their new gender. The court did not have the medical expertise and was not in a position to give guidance on this.

Second, the recognition of gender reassignment for the purposes of marriage cannot be sensibly made in isolation from other areas where a distinction is drawn between people of the basis of gender. A clear and coherent policy would be required in relation to this.

Third, marriage is an institution deeply embedded in the culture of the UK as being between two persons of the opposite sex. It would involve a fundamental change in the traditional concept of marriage, which ought to be considered as part of an overall review of the most appropriate way to deal with the difficulties confronting transgender people.

#### s 4 issue

In Bellinger, the defendant’s Counsel argued that the House of Lords should not make a declaration because, following the ECtHR judgment in Goodwin v UK the government had accepted that UK law was not compatible with articles 8 and 14, and had announced forthcoming legislation to remedy the incompatibility. Lord Nicholls stated:
> ‘Nevertheless, when proceedings are already before the House, it is desirable that in a case of such sensitivity this House, as the court of final appeal in this country, should formally record that the present state of statute law is incompatible with the Convention’.

### Summary

Appellant male at birth but underwent gender reassignment surgery and went through marriage ceremony with man - Marriage not valid under Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 s 11(c) which required parties to be male and female - Those words did not include post-operative transsexual persons - Section 11(c) incompatible with European Convention on Human Rights Arts 8, 12 - Human Rights Act 1998 s 4.

### Abstract

The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 s.11(c) is incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8 and Art.12. W, a post-operative male to female transsexual, appealed against a decision ([2001] EWCA Civ 1140, [2002] Fam. 150) that W was not validly married to her husband, H, by virtue of the fact that, at law, W was a man. Furthermore, W sought a declaration that the [Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 s.11(c)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B069C50E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=66d11e82cc0344258418445a1ced66f5&contextData=(sc.Default)) was incompatible with the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=66d11e82cc0344258418445a1ced66f5&contextData=(sc.Default)) and Art.12. W contended that (1) she should be recognised as female within the meaning s.11(c)of the 1973 Act and consequently, that the marriage was valid at its inception and was subsisting, and (2) in the light of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in _[Goodwin v United Kingdom (28957/95) [2002] I.R.L.R. 664, [2002] 7 WLUK 347](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB2850350E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=66d11e82cc0344258418445a1ced66f5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , the court should declare s.11(c) of the 1973 Act to be incompatible with her rights under Art.8 and Art.12.

Held, dismissing the appeal but giving a declaration of incompatibility, that 

(1) recognition of B as female for the purposes of s.11(c) would necessitate giving the expressions “male” and “female” in the 1973 Act a novel and extended meaning. Thus, a declaration which conferred validity upon W's marriage would represent a major change in the law relating to gender reassignment which would have far-reaching ramifications, necessitating extensive enquiry and the widest possible consultation. The recognition of gender reassignment for the purposes of marriage was not to be dealt with in a piecemeal fashion, but should form part of a coherent policy. These issues were ill-suited for determination in the courts and were pre-eminently a matter for Parliament, the more especially where the government had announced an unequivocal intention to introduce primary legislation on the subject, _[Corbett v Corbett (otherwise Ashley) (No.1) [1971] P. 83, [1970] 2 WLUK 3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8E7F3610E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=66d11e82cc0344258418445a1ced66f5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered, and 

(2) it was not possible to construe s.11(c) of the 1973 Act so as to give effect to W's rights under Art.8 and Art. 12. Given the decision in Goodwin the court was compelled to make a declaration of incompatibility under s.4 of the 1998 Act, Goodwin followed.

Note that the two parties are not in dispute: the two parties have a perfectly happy marriage. Just brought as a point of law. 

Before Bellinger, legally it is your chromosomes which determines whether you are male or female. This was a problem for one of the Bellingers. 

So for a boy who goes through gender reassignment surgery to have female genitals and attributes, still have male chromosomes, so legally still male. This is a violation (Goodwin). The question is whether s 11 could be reinterpreted. The House of Lords felt that this was not possible, despite linguistically this seeming very possible. There were three reasons for this; see above. 

Today, the modern debate is can you just self-identify without having undergone gender reassignment surgery. Before, had to have surgery to be recognised. The court looked at wider ramifications. And final reason: traditional idea of marriage. 

Lord Nicholls gives the lead judgment: Karl reckons reasons 1 and 2 are the main reasons for him. But for Lord Hope, the traditional idea of marriage is the centrepiece of his reasoning. 

Takeaway: there is a lot more than language at stake. 

Note the courts don't like hypotheticals, but don't mind artificial cases raising genuine issues. 

Court issued declaration of incompatibility: govt response was Gender Recognition Act. This allowed people to change their legal gender following gender reassignment surgery. The Govt had already said it would publish a bill following Goodwin, but the Govt had not taken any action to that date. Perhaps this made the courts comfortable.

The case concerned the use of the phrase ‘male and female’ in s 11(c) Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The ECtHR had previously found the failure of the UK to recognise reassignment of gender for the purpose of marriage to be a violation of Arts 8 and 12 ECHR (right to family and private life; right to marriage).

The House of Lords found that it was not possible to use s 3 to interpret the legislation to extend to those who had undergone gender reassignment surgery. This was because:
- It was not obvious what criteria had to be satisfied for a person to be legally recognised as having acquired their new gender
- The decision could not be made in isolation, without a reassessment of isolation of gender in other areas of policy
- Marriage as an institution being between two people of the opposite sex.

The court made a declaration of incompatibility, following the assessment of the ECtHR. It was seen as desirable that the court of final appeal in the country formally recorded the incompatibility, in recognition of the political influence of such a declaration.
