This case was decided during the Second World War and illustrates the prevailing deferential judicial attitude of the time. The Home Secretary was empowered under Reg.18B of the Defence Regulations to imprison any person, if he had _'reasonable cause to believe_' that such a person had 'hostile intentions'. Liversidge was detained without trial under this regulation. He sued the Home Secretary for false imprisonment, claiming that 'reasonable cause to believe' imputed an objective factual standard, which the Home Secretary had not met, as no evidence of his intentions had been shown.

The majority of the House of Lords disagreed and accepted the Home Secretary's interpretation of the regulation. They held that there was no objective requirement, enabling him to take this action, as long as his belief was an honest one. Thus, the courts could not inquire into the grounds for the detention, unless there was evidence to suggest that the Home Secretary had not acted in good faith.

In the minority was Lord Atkin. Famously accusing the majority of being 'more executive minded than the executive', he concluded that, had Parliament wished to give the Home Secretary unlimited discretion, it would not have qualified the grant of power with the word 'reasonable'. In his view, the word purported the existence of facts or a state of facts; therefore, the Home Secretary needed to show some evidence for his justification.
