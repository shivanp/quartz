The applicants were conscript soldiers serving in the Netherlands armed forces. They had various penalties imposed on them for offences against military discipline. The applicants contended that the proceedings held before the military authorities and the Supreme Military Court were in breach of their right to a fair trial. The European Court of Human Rights held that there was a violation of art 5(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, because the provisional arrest of one of the applicants exceeded the maximum period of 24 hours as laid down by the relevant legislation.Â In respect of three of the applicants, there was a breach of art 6(1) of the Convention which required that judicial proceedings be conducted in public. However, the fact that the disciplinary proceedings of which the applicants complained were not attended by as many guarantees as criminal proceedings brought against civilians, did not result in a breach of art 14 of the Convention.
