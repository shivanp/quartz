CDHA appealed from the decision of Laws, J. (Times, March 15, 1995) to quash its decision not to fund further treatment for a ten year old girl (B) suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia. The proposed treatment consisted of chemotherapy, costing GBP 15,000 with an estimated chance of success of 10 to 20 per cent and, if successful, a second bone marrow transplant costing GBP 60,000, with the same estimated chance of success.

Held, allowing the appeal, that a decision which affected a young patient's life was of the utmost importance, but the court must confine itself to ruling only on whether CDHA's decision was lawful. To find that CDHA failed to consider the wishes of B's family in making the decision was clearly wrong, because CDHA's director, under considerable pressure, was fully aware of the family's views. To require CDHA to make a decision on the basis that only part of the funding might be required if the chemotherapy was unsuccessful was unrealistic. CDHA's decision was not flawed by the use of the word "experimental" to describe the proposed course of treatment. The treatment had no proven record of success and, while in an ideal world all treatment would be funded at whatever cost, it was essential in reality to make agonising decisions on the most effective use of limited resources.
