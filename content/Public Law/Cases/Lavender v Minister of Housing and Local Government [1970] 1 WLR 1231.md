The Minister of Housing and Local Government refused Lavender's application for planning permission to develop land for use as a quarry, after hearing objections from the Minister of Agriculture.

The decision was challenged on the grounds that the Minister of Housing and Local Government had effectively abdicated his decision to the Minister of Agriculture. The House of Lords held therefore that the minister had wrongly delegated his discretion.

### Abstract

On an appeal to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Minister cannot be said to have properly exercised his discretion where he has effectively delegated the decision to the Minister of Agriculture. The Advisory Committee on Land and Gravel 1948-53, recommended that certain high quality agricultural land should be protected against disturbance by gravel working and reserved indefinitely for agriculture. L had applied for planning permission to work such land, but the Minister of Agriculture strongly objected. The County Planning Committee recommended the granting of permission subject to conditions as to restoration which were agreed by L, but the Minister of Agriculture still maintained his objection, and on that ground the planning authority refused permission. This was upheld by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the ground that it was at present his policy not to release such land unless the Minister of Agriculture was not opposed to such working.

Held, allowing the appeal, 

(1) that the courts had no authority to interfere with the way in which the Minister carried out his planning policy; 

(2) that the Minister might obtain the views of other Government Departments, but 

(3) that the Minister had by his stated policy improperly delegated to the Minister of Agriculture the effective decision when there was no real chance that he would waive his objection, and consequently the Minister had failed to exercise a proper or indeed any discretion.
