Rooke’s Case, decided in 1598, concerned the power of the Sewers Commissioners to levy charges for the repair of river banks. The Commissioners charged one nearby landowner for the repair of an entire section of bank. His neighbours were equally vulnerable to flooding, and thus benefited from the repairs without bearing any of the cost. The court held that the Commissioners’ decision was arbitrary and unlawful. According to Chief Justice Coke, although the Commissioners had an apparently unbounded discretion under the statute, ‘their proceedings ought to be limited and bound with the rule of reason and law’.
