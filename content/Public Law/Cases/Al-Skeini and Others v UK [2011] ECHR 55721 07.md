**Facts:**

Al-Skeini and Others v United Kingdom (2011) 53 EHRR 18 is a case which concerns six civilians who were killed by British soldiers in Iraq in 2003. Moreover, four were killed as a result of British military operations. However, one was beaten up and drowned by British soldiers. Furthermore, one was suffocated whilst in custody of the British army. 

As Iraq is not a signatory to the ECHR, the UK argued it did not need to uphold the ECHR in Iraq.

**Issue:**

An issue was raised regarding whether or not there was a violation of [Article 2 ECHR](https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf) 

**Held:**

In conclusion, the Court held that that the UK must still uphold the ECHR in Iraq. This was due to having de-facto control over the country. Therefore, the Court ruled a violation of the procedural obligations under Article 2 ECHR. 

Moreover, in general, an English court would have no jurisdiction over deaths abroad at the hands of British troops in a war situation. However,Â  one of the deaths had occurred whist the deceased had been in the custody of the British Forces whilst they were the occupying power. Here sufficient jurisdiction and duties of care arose. Thus, the family were entitled to a proper investigation of the circumstances of the death.
