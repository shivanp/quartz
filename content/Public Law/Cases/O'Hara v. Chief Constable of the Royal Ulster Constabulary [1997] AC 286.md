## Abstract
O, who had been arrested without warrant under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 s.12, appealed against the dismissal of his appeal in an action for unlawful arrest and false imprisonment where it was found that the arresting officer, S, had reasonable grounds for suspecting that O had been involved in acts of terrorism. S had acted upon information given to him at a briefing attended by other police officers which was held admissible and sufficient to constitute the state of mind required of an arresting officer under the Act.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that under s.12 an arresting officer had to have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person he was arresting had been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The test involved was twofold, requiring the arresting officer to have formed a genuine suspicion in his own mind, but also that a reasonable man would have also reached the same conclusion based upon the information available. As the Act vested responsibility and accountability upon individual officers, merely acting upon the instructions of a superior officer was not capable of amounting to grounds for the necessary suspicion. Although information need not be based upon an officer's own observations, there had to be some further basis for suspicion, such as a report from an informer or information from an anonymous source. O's arrest and detention was not unlawful as S was entitled to form a suspicion, based upon the briefing, which would be regarded as reasonable by an independent observer.

The plaintiff had been arrested on the basis of the 1984 Act. The officer had no particular knowledge of the plaintiff’s involvement, relying on a briefing which led to the arrest.

Held: A reasonable suspicion upon which an arrest was founded need not be based on the arresting officer’s own observations. All that is required is a genuine and reasonably based suspicion in the mind of the officer. The test as to whether there are reasonable grounds for suspicion to justify an arrest is partly subjective, in that the arresting officer must have formed a genuine suspicion that the person being arrested was guilty of an offence, and partly objective, in that there must be reasonable grounds for forming such a suspicion. Such grounds can arise from information received from another, even if it subsequently proves to be false, provided that a reasonable man, having regard to all the circumstances, would regard them as reasonable grounds for suspicion.

Lord Hope considered what was the level of suspicion necessary to found a valid arrest under the section, saying: 
> ‘My Lords, the test which s 12(1) of the 1984 Act has laid down is a simple but practical one. It relates entirely to what is in the mind of the arresting officer when the power is exercised. In part it is a subjective test, because he must have formed a genuine suspicion in his own mind that the person has been concerned in acts of terrorism. In part also it is an objective one, because there must also be reasonable grounds for the suspicion which he has formed. But the application of the objective test does not require the court to look beyond what was in the mind of the arresting officer. It is the grounds which were in his mind at the time which must be found to be reasonable grounds for the suspicion which he has formed. All that the objective test requires is that these grounds be examined objectively and that they be judged at the time when the power was exercised.’

Lord Steyn said: ‘Certain general propositions about the powers of constables under a section such as section 12(1) can now be summarised. 

(1) In order to have a reasonable suspicion, the constable need not have evidence amounting to a prima facie case. Ex hypothesi one is considering a preliminary stage of the investigation and information from an informer or a tip-off from a member of the public may be enough: Hussien v. Chong Fook Kam [1970] A.C. 942, 949. 

(2) Hearsay information may therefore afford a constable a reasonable ground to arrest. Such information may come from other officers: Hussien’s case, ibid.

(3) The information which causes the constable to be suspicious of the individual must be in existence to the knowledge of the police officer at the time he makes the arrest. 

(4) The executive ‘discretion’ to arrest or not as Lord Diplock described it in Mohammed-Holgate v. Duke [1984] A.C. 437, 446, vests in the constable, who is engaged on the decision to arrest or not, and not in his superior officers.’ and

> ‘For obvious practical reasons, police officers must be able to rely upon each other in taking decisions as to whom to arrest or where to search and in what circumstances. The statutory power does not require that the constable who exercises the power must be in possession of all the information which has led to a decision, perhaps taken by others, that the time has come for it to be exercised. What it does require is that the constable who exercises the power must first have equipped himself with sufficient information so that he has reasonable cause to suspect before the power is exercised.’
