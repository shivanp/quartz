Travellers faced eviction from local authority land in circumstances where the local authority was under a statutory duty to provide sites in their area. It had failed to do so, and it had not even attempted to provide temporary sites.

Held: It was found that no reasonable local authority would have placed more weight on the fact that there would be a delay in reclaiming the land, while temporary sites were found, over 
(i) the effects of eviction on the travellers themselves, and 
(ii) the impact on those who were likely to be affected elsewhere by the travellers trespassing in the meantime.
