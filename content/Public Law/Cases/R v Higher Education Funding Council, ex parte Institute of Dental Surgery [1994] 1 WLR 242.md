Academic judgments such as those made by the Higher Education Funding Council are not in that class that normally require reasons to be given. The Higher Education Funding Council decided to allocate research grants by rating institutions on a scale of 1 to 5. The Council invited submissions, and set out how it would conduct the review procedure, indicating that there would be no appeal from the individual ratings given to the institutions by the Council. The Institute was rated at level 2, but given no reasons as to why its rating had been reduced. The difference meant a reduction in grant of GBP 270,000. The Institute applied for judicial review of the Council's decision.

Held, dismissing the applications, that academic judgments were not in that class of case which required reasons to be given as a routine aspect of procedural fairness, but were in a class where it might be shown that in the circumstances of the particular decision, fairness required reasons to be given. Further, there was nothing inexplicable about the decision itself which might have obliged the Council to furnish reasons (_[R. v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p.
