### Facts

Bland was injured in the Hillsborough disaster when he was seventeen and a half years old and was left in a persistent vegetative state. He remained in this state for over two years with no sign of improvement, whilst being kept alive by life support machines. Bland could breathe by himself but required feeding via a tube and received full care. The doctors that were treating Bland were granted approval to remove of the tube that was feeding him. This decision was then appealed to the House of Lords by the Solicitor acting on Bland’s behalf.

### Issues

A patient that is in a persistent vegetative state cannot withhold or offer consent for treatment. This requires the doctors to act in the best interests of the patient, which in this case was whether the continuation of Bland being on life support was in his best interests. It was important to understand whether life support can ever be withdrawn from an individual who cannot provide medical professionals with informed consent on a specific issue.

### Decision/Outcome

Doctors have a duty to act in the best interests of their patients but this does not necessarily require them to prolong life. On the basis that there was no potential for improvement, the treatment Bland was receiving was deemed not to be in his best interests. It is not lawful to cause or accelerate death. However, in this instance, it was lawful to withhold life-extending treatment which in this instance was the food that Bland was being fed through a tube. Appeal dismissed.

The Official Solicitor's appeal to the House of Lords was eventually dismissed, as it was considered that the issues involved – namely the best interests of the patient and the established distinction between actions and omissions in the law on homicide – could legitimately be adjudicated upon by the courts.

It is notable in this case that the law lords emphasised the desirability of Parliament legislating on novel matters of policy, given continuing significant technological advances in the medical field:

> "Where a case raises wholly new moral and social issues, in my judgement it is not for the judges to seek to develop new, all embracing, principles of law in a way which reflects the individual judges' moral stance when society as a whole is substantially divided on the relevant moral issues.”
> Lord Browne-Wilkinson

In this instance the law lords appeared content that they were working from existing principles in relation to the distinction between acts and omissions. They were ‘allowing nature to take its course’ rather than condoning a positive act allowing life to be brought to an end. But the issue was a narrow one and one can see a tendency here towards deference to Parliament on novel and contentious matters.

>“The function of the court in these circumstances is to determine this particular case in accordance with the existing law, and not seek to develop new law laying down a new regimen"
>Lord Browne-Wilkinson
