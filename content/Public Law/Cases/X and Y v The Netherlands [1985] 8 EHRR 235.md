A mentally handicapped girl, while in a children's home, was sexually assaulted. Her father lodged a complaint with the police because the girl was mentally incapable of doing so in person. The authorities decided not to prosecute the offender because the criminal law, under which acts of that kind were punishable, applied only if the victim herself took action, and a complaint by her father was insufficient. The father claimed that that amounted to a violation of art 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights held that the protection afforded by the civil law was insufficient in a case which affected the fundamental values of private life. Only the criminal law could produce the deterrent necessary. Thus, in the instant case, since the girl did not receive the protection of the criminal law which was required to secure respect for her private life, there was a breach of art 8 of the Convention.
