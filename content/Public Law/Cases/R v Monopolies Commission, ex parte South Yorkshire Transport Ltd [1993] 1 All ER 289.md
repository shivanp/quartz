The House of Lords considered how to interpret the phrase 'a substantial part of the United Kingdomâ€™.

Lord Mustill observed that 'substantial' accommodates a wide range of meanings and warned of the dangers of attaching a spurious degree of precision on an inherently imprecise word. His view was that the wording was so broad and imprecise that different decision-makers might reach differing conclusions when applying it to a given case.

He held that the court should not intervene unless the decision-maker's conclusion was irrational. (Note, the potential overlap between error of law and the JR ground of unreasonableness).

SYT, a bus company formed by the merger of 5 bus companies, challenged the MMC's jurisdiction to decide that the merger was against the public interest. The Court of Appeal found in SYT's favour. MMC appealed.

Held: Appeal allowed. The [Fair Trading Act 1973, s.64(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3208BD30E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=708420cd4da9490eaab003b1f0fcecba&contextData=(sc.Default)) gave the MMC jurisdiction to investigate a merger if the geographical area affected was a "substantial part" of the UK. What amounted to "substantial" could not be a hard and fast rule and did not depend solely on geography or arithmetic, but should be construed in such a way that it did not limit the MMC. An area was substantial if its size, character and importance made it worth considering for the purposes of the 1973 Act. The Commission had decided what criteria to apply and had applied them to the area under consideration. The court could not impugn its decision as irrational, and the Commission's decision must therefore stand
