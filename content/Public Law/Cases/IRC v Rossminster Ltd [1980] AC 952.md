This case concerned the use by the Inland Revenue Commissioners (‘IRC’) of powers to enter and search premises, and seize documents, if they had 'reasonable grounds' for suspecting an offence and 'reasonable cause to believe' that the items seized would be required as evidence in relation to tax fraud. Suspecting tax fraud, the IRC officials obtained search warrants, entered Rossminster’s premises, and seized documents without informing its directors of the particulars of what they suspected.

In notable contrast to Lord Denning M.R. in the Court of Appeal, the law lords did not find that the IRC’s actions were unlawful for lack of specificity about the details about the fraud suspected. This was because no such specifics were expressly required on the face of the relevant Act.

Significantly, though, they found that the use of the phrase 'reasonable cause to believe' was a question of objective fact, to be tried on evidence. Lord Diplock stated: 
>“the time has come to acknowledge openly that the majority of this House in Liversidge v Anderson were expediently and, at that time perhaps, excusably wrong and the dissenting speech of Lord Atkin was right".

### Abstract

Where the Revenue acts under a warrant issued under the [Taxes Management Act 1970 s.20C](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFE8D1CD0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d0e7c164f61a4dfbadca5d36c3f774da&contextData=(sc.Default)) the warrant need not contain particulars of the offences suspected and the occupant of the premises searched has no rights to be told what offences were alleged to have been committed. On July 13 1979, officers of the Inland Revenue entered and searched the offices of Rossminister Ltd and AJR Financial Services Ltd and the homes of Mr Roy Tucker and Mr Ronald Plummer. They seized and removed large quantities of documents. They were acting under warrant issued the previous day under the Taxes Management Act 1970 s.20C, by the Common Sergeant. It was claimed that 

(1) the warrants were invalid because they did not sufficiently particularise the alleged offences, and 
(2) the action taken was unlawful since the officers had not had, or could not have had, reasonable cause to believe that the documents seized might be required as evidence in proceedings for "tax fraud.".

Held, (Lord Salmon dissenting), reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, that 
(1) the warrants were issued in accordance with, and in the form prescribed by, Taxes Management Act 1970 s.20C, and were valid, and 
(2) the evidence fell very far short of showing that the action actually taken by the officers of the Inland Revenue was in excess of their powers.
