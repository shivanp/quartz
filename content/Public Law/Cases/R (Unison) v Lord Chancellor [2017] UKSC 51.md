## Summary
The Employment Tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal Fees Order 2013, which introduced a fees' regime for bringing and continuing claims in employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal, was unlawful under both domestic and EU law as it effectively prevented access to justice. The Order was unlawful ab initio and had to be quashed.

## Abstract

The Supreme Court had to determine whether fees charged under the Employment Tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal Fees Order 2013 were unlawful.

The Order, which had been made by the Lord Chancellor in the exercise of statutory powers, introduced a fees regime for bringing and continuing claims in employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Under the regime, claimants had to pay an issue and hearing fee, unless otherwise exempted. The poorest claimants qualified for full remission of the fees and, in exceptional circumstances, the Lord Chancellor could exercise his discretionary power to remit fees paid by other claimants. Since the introduction of the fees, there had been a 66-70% reduction in the number of claims brought in employment tribunals.

The appellant trade union argued that the fees interfered unjustifiably with the right of access to justice under both the common law and EU law, and discriminated unlawfully against women and other protected groups who typically brought “Type B” claims which attracted higher fees.

## Held
Appeal allowed.

(1) Constitutional right of access to the courts — The constitutional right of access to the courts was inherent in the rule of law. Courts existed in order to ensure that the law was applied and enforced. In order for the courts to perform that function, people, in principle, had to have unimpeded access to them. That right of access was valuable to society as a whole, not just to the particular individuals involved. It had long been recognised and any hindrance or impediment by the executive to that right required clear authorisation by Parliament (see paras 66, 68-69, 71, 74, 78 of judgment).

(2) Whether the Fees Order effectively prevented access to justice — The Order would be ultra vires if there was a real risk that persons would effectively be prevented from having access to justice. The fall in the number of claims since the introduction of the fees had been so sharp, substantial and sustained that it warranted the conclusion that a significant number of people who otherwise would have brought claims had found the fees to be unaffordable. Persons whose employment rights had been breached, or who believed them to have been breached, were often under a practical compulsion to apply to a tribunal for redress. That practical compulsion made the fall in the number of claims indicative of something more than a change in consumer behaviour. 

The question of whether the fees effectively prevented access to justice had to be decided according to the likely impact of those fees on behaviour in the real world. Fees, therefore, had to be affordable not in a theoretical sense, but in the sense that they could reasonably be afforded. Where households on low-to-middle incomes could only afford fees by sacrificing the ordinary and reasonable expenditure required to maintain what would generally be regarded as an acceptable standard of living, the fees could not be regarded as affordable. 

The court could not be deflected from that conclusion by the Lord Chancellor's discretionary power of remission: the effects of the Order had occurred notwithstanding the existence of the remission scheme. Furthermore, it was not only where fees were unaffordable that they could prevent access to justice. They could equally have that effect if they rendered it futile or irrational to bring a claim, for example where the reward sought was not financial, such as claims to enforce the right to regular work breaks or to written particulars of employment. If the financial award was for a modest amount, no sensible claimant would pursue the claim unless he could be virtually certain he would succeed and that the award would include the reimbursement of fees. In practice, the Order had had a particularly deterrent effect on the bringing of claims of low monetary value. The Order effectively prevented access to justice and was therefore unlawful (paras 87, 90-98).

(3) Could the Fees Order be justified as a necessary intrusion on the right of access to justice? — The primary aim of the Order was to transfer some of the cost burden from taxpayers on to the users of the tribunal system. That objective had been achieved to some extent, but it did not follow that fees which intruded to a lesser extent upon the right of access to justice would have been any less effective. The fees had not been set at the optimal price: the price elasticity of demand was greatly underestimated (paras 99-100).

(4) EU law — Many of the rights asserted before employment tribunals were rights contained in EU law. Given that the fees imposed by the Order were in practice unaffordable by some people, and that they were so high as to prevent even people who could afford them from pursuing claims for small amounts and non-monetary claims, it followed that the Order imposed limitations on the exercise of EU-derived rights which were disproportionate. It was therefore unlawful under EU law (paras 105-117).

(5) (Per Hale LJ) Indirect Discrimination — The Order was indirectly discriminatory within the meaning of the Equality Act 2010 s.19. Charging higher fees for Type B claims had not been shown to be a proportionate means of achieving the stated aims of the fees regime (paras 121-134).
