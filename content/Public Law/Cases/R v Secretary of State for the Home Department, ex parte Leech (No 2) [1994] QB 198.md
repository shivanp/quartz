 Concerned prison rules permitting the interception of legal correspondence between a prisoner and his lawyers. 
 
The Court of Appeal held that these interfered with a constitutional right to the free flow of communications between a solicitor and a client about contemplated legal proceedings. And it also made clear that this interference could only be authorised by express words in the statute or by necessary implication.

### Abstract

The [Prison Rules 1964 r.33(3)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9DCD32E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3da72303af7e4e2a975d9603b4e8668e&contextData=(sc.Default)) is ultra vires in so far as it applies to correspondence between a prisoner and his legal advisor. L was a prisoner engaged in and contemplating various civil actions. Not wishing to have his correspondence with his legal advisors subjected to censorship he applied for judicial review and sought to quash the governor's power to censor his correspondence with his solicitor as being ultra vires the [Prison Act 1952 s.47(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I664DBD80E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3da72303af7e4e2a975d9603b4e8668e&contextData=(sc.Default)) . The judge refused his application. L appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that it was a fundamental principle that a citizen had unimpeded access to court and to a solicitor and s.47(1) did not authorise the making of a rule that created an impediment to that process. Section 47(1) conferred a power wide enough to permit the reading of such correspondence to ensure it was bona fide but no more. Rule 33 was ultra vires in so far as it purported to apply to correspondence between a prisoner and his legal advisor (Raymond v Honey [1982] C.L.Y. 2613, R. v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p. Anderson [1984] C.L.Y. 2762 applied).
