U, a Filipino seaman who had deserted his ship, applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State's decision to detain him with a view to deportation. In 1993 U jumped ship whilst in the UK and in 1994 married a woman with indefinite leave to remain. The Secretary of State claimed that, although Home Office Policy Document DP/2/93 para.2 provided a general rule against proceeding with deportation where an illegal entrant was in a genuine and subsisting marriage and the marriage pre-dated the enforcement action, U's status as a deserting seaman took him outside the provision, as enforcement against him began when his desertion was notified, not when the detention was authorised.

Held, allowing the application, quashing the decision and ordering re-determination of U's application for leave to remain, that the [Immigration Act 1971 s.11(5)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0D6A5970E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=322e79d35bda4f50acf90b4e4afc943d&contextData=(sc.Search)) provided that U, as a deserter, was an illegal entrant and he was therefore covered by the wording of DP/2/93. It was anomalous that a marriage contracted prior to enforcement action should benefit from protection, whereas one contracted afterwards did not, especially as marriage could be entered into purely to forestall anticipated enforcement. However, U was entitled to the same treatment as other illegal entrants and the Secretary of State erred in seeking to exclude him from the benefits of the policy which clearly applied to him.
