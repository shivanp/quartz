P, a British national who had received treatment for drug addiction, was arrested and detained in Greece for drug-related offences. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and on appeal he was ordered to be expelled from Greece. P complained about the conditions of his detention, the Greek authorities' failure to differentiate between remand and convicted prisoners and the opening of his correspondence from the Commission by the prison authorities.

Held, that 

(1) the court relied on the findings of the Commission following a visit to the prison where P was detained. P shared a cell with no ventilation which consequently became unbearably hot and in which there was no privacy when using the toilet. Although there was no evidence of a positive intention to humiliate P nevertheless the prison conditions diminished P's human dignity and amounted to degrading treatment within the meaning of the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38C9C0AD773A4385868CB431E132B1A7/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=018b9a0c011a40d8b5575ce9dc8bebb5&contextData=(sc.Default)) Art.3; 

(2) the failure of the prison authorities to provide a separate regime for remand prisoners did not violate the presumption of innocence and accordingly there had been no violation of Art.6(2), and 

(3) (by a majority) the opening of the Commission's letters to P had a legal basis in Greek law but could not be justified as being necessary in a democratic society. Accordingly there had been a violation of Art.8.
