The Minister refused to refer a complaint to a committee of investigation because he believed he could be embarrassed by an unfavourable report, despite the fact that he had a power to direct such an investigation. The House of Lords held that this decision was unlawful because he was exercising his discretion not to refer, for a wrongful or improper purpose.

Lord Reid stated:

> 'The Minister's discretion … must be conferred from a construction of the Act read as a whole, and for the reasons I have given it would infer that the discretion … has been used by the Minister in a manner which is not in accordance with the intentions of the statute which conferred it.'

This case is the basis for the term “Padfield principle”.

### Abstract

Where a statute gives a Minister an unfettered discretion and in a particular case the Minister gives no reasons for a decision in purported exercise of that discretion, the court is not prevented, in a proper case, from, ordering the Minister to reconsider the matter according to the law. On a complaint about the functioning of the Milk Marketing Board Scheme, to the effect that south-eastern producers were paid too little for their milk, the Minister declined to refer the matter to a committee under the [Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 s.19(3)(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7D7D68C0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c9280014e7bb4a0383b1430f98caf0b7&contextData=(sc.Default)), stating that it raised wide issues, that he had an unfettered discretion, that he owed no duty to producers in any particular region, and that if the committee upheld the complaint the Minister would be expected to make a statutory order to give effect to their recommendations.

Held, (Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest dissenting), that an order of mandamus would issue to the Minister requiring him to reconsider the matter because 

(a) the Minister's purported reasons were irrelevant, 

(b) although he had an unfettered discretion the Minister was bound to consider only relevant matters and to exclude irrelevant ones, and 

(c) even where he gave no reasons the Minister could be required by mandamus to consider the complaint lawfully. Per Lord Reid: the Minister cannot so use his discretion as to frustrate the objects of the statute which gives him that discretion.

Padfield v Ministry of Agriculture [1968] AC 997 is an Administrative Law case which established the Padfield principle.

**Facts:** 

The Minister of Agriculture decline to refer the complaint about the functioning of the Milk Marketing Board Scheme to the committee. Southeastern producers were claiming that they received too little amount of money for their milk. The Minister held that he had an unfettered discretion in the matter and that he owed no duty to the farmers in any region. 

**Issues:**

In Padfield v Ministry of Agriculture, would the complainants succeed?

**Held:**

The House of Lords issued the order of mandamus so that the Minister would reconsider the complaint. The House held that although the Minister did have an unfettered discretion, however, that discretion was given to him to enforce the purpose intended by the Parliament.  As per Lord Reid: 
> ‘… If the minister, by reason of his having misconstrued the Act or for any other reason, so uses his discretion as to thwart or run counter to the policy and objects of the Act, then our law would be very deficient if persons aggrieved were not entitled to the protection of the Court’.
