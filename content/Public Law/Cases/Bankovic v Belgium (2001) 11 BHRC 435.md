B was a citizen of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. His daughter was killed in a NATO air attack on a Serbian television station. He complained that the attack had breached the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1B58031DEC86485FA3AEEFBD8980CD10/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=cc786e08b9b04152bad6a18a664bde79&contextData=(sc.Search)), Art.10 and Art.13. Belgium, along with the other NATO governments, contended that as B was not within any of their respective jurisdictions, the complaint did not come within Art.1 of the Convention.

Held, finding the complaint to be inadmissible, that there was no jurisdictional link between B and the NATO States. Under Art.1, the Convention was subject to territorial limits in terms of jurisdiction and it was only in very exceptional cases that acts performed outside the territory of the contracting states, or taking effect beyond their territories, would amount to an exercise of jurisdiction for the purposes of Art.1. Such extra territoriality was generally found to exist as the result of military occupation or where the government of the state concerned consented to the action taken by the contracting states. As neither of these situations existed in respect of the NATO action taken against Serbia, B's complaint did not fulfil the jurisdictional requirements of Art.1.
