The case concerned the treatment of terrorist suspects in the custody of British security forces in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s at the height of ‘the Troubles’.

While detained, they were subjected to a systematic programme of treatment designed to make them reveal information and to make them more compliant in their future dealings with the security forces (i.e. to become informers).

The programme, which was clearly planned and authorised, was known as the ‘Five Techniques'. These included practices such as wall-standing (being made to stand inches from a wall for anything up to 20 hours with limbs outstretched), sleep deprivation, subjection to intense noise, hooding, and withholding of food.

The case was first considered by the Council of Europe's Commission on Human Rights (a non-determinative, non-judicial body that is now defunct), which concluded that these combined techniques did amount to 'torture'. The UK government accepted these findings and promptly denounced the earlier practices.

**_Ireland v UK_ – the ECtHR**

Following the Commission’s decision, somewhat surprisingly, the ECtHR later concluded that this was 'merely' a case of inhuman or degrading treatment, indicating perhaps a reluctance to classify psychological techniques as torture.

Some of the minority tried to address this by arguing that any activity that aims at breaking an individual's will should be classified as torture, whether it involves actual pain or mere discomfort. This was not approved by the majority, however.

Ireland alleged that the United Kingdom's detention of I.R.A. suspects involving detaining of prisoners and their treatment; wall-standing, hooding and deprivation of sleep and food infringed Art.3 of the Convention of Human Rights, as torture, and also Art.5 and was not excused by Art.15 as an emergency, was discriminatory under Art.14 because it singled out one group, the I.R.A. The Commission of Human Rights supported the allegations of breaches of the Human Rights Convention. The court regretted the British Government's failure to assist the commission in breach of Art.28 and held, that detention without trial did infringe Art.5(1)-(4) but was permitted because of the public emergency (art. 15) and that there was no discrimination under Art.14. The five interrogation techniques did constitute an infringement of Art.3 as a form of inhuman or degrading treatment.
