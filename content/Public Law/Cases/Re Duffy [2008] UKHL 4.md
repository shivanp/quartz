The case concerned the appointment of two new members to the Parades Commission of Northern Ireland (a body set up to resolve disputes relating to marches and parades in the province). The two appointees were both prominent loyalist proponents of a parade along the Garvaghy Road, one of the most contentious of all marching routes in Northern Ireland at that time.

Held: Lord Bingham stressed the significance of the Parades Commission as an independent, objective, and impartial mediator and concluded that the decision made was one which a reasonable Secretary of State could not have made, if properly directing himself in law, if in possession of the relevant facts and if taking account of necessary considerations. Both appointments were therefore confirmed as unlawful. (Note here the cross-over with the ground of illegality in terms of relevant factors).
