Lord Reed emphasised the central importance of the common law in upholding core principles such as fairness to the individual, the need to involve individuals in processes affecting their lives, and the over-arching importance of accountability and transparency in government. The Supreme Court found unanimously that the refusal by the Parole Board to allow Osborn and the other two claimants an oral hearing breached the requirements of procedural fairness owed at common law.

Lord Reed reiterated the previous line that the obligation to have an oral hearing will continue to depend on the context of the given decision, but he appeared to tilt the balance in favour of such elements of fair process, laying out 'general guidance' to public decision-makers. Notably, he stated: 
> 'The board should guard against any temptation to refuse oral hearings as a means of saving time, trouble and expense.’

Lord Reed held that the Parole Board had acted unlawfully in failing to allow oral hearings for three prisoners when important decisions were being taken about their release or recall on licence.

Though the challenge to the Board had been based on article 5(4) ECHR, Lord Reed stated that the HRA did not:

> “supersede the protection of human rights under the common law or statute or create a discrete body of law based upon the judgments of the European Court. Human rights continue to be protected by our domestic law, interpreted and developed in accordance with the act when appropriate".

### Summary

The Supreme Court gave guidance about the circumstances in which the Parole Board was required to hold an oral hearing in order to comply with its common law duty of fairness and the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.5(4)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8241ED61EE3C4D77BE2C280D3AC956DC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a759282db3a441e28673d406e5f3cf23&contextData=(sc.Default)) when determining a prisoner's application for release or transfer to open prison conditions.

### Abstract

In conjoined appeals, the appellant prisoners (O, B and R) appealed against decisions (_[R. (on the application of Osborn) v Parole Board for England and Wales [2010] EWCA Civ 1409, [2011] U.K.H.R.R. 35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBA8A2F5008A111E0B8079A0F1E594C42/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a759282db3a441e28673d406e5f3cf23&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[[2011] NICA 6, [2012] N.I. 38](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0CAE8C10F30411E1888AFA15D7672059/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a759282db3a441e28673d406e5f3cf23&contextData=(sc.Default))_) concerning the circumstances in which the Parole Board was required to hold an oral hearing.

O was a determinate-sentence prisoner who had been recalled to prison following his release on licence. B and R were life-sentence prisoners who had served their minimum terms. O and B sought release, and R sought a transfer to open prison conditions. Each case was considered on the papers by a single member of the board, who declined to recommend release or transfer. Each prisoner's request for an oral hearing was refused, and each sought judicial review of that refusal. In O and B's case, the Court of Appeal held that the refusals were not unfair. In R's case, the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland held that the board had neither breached its common law duty of fairness nor violated R's rights under the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.5(4)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8241ED61EE3C4D77BE2C280D3AC956DC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a759282db3a441e28673d406e5f3cf23&contextData=(sc.Default)).

### Held

Appeals allowed.

(1) The guarantees set out in the Convention were mostly expressed at a high level of generality and had to be fulfilled through specific domestic law. To comply with art.5(4), the board had to comply with the relevant domestic substantive and procedural rules. Convention rights were not a discrete body of law derived from Strasbourg caselaw; rather, they permeated the United Kingdom's legal system. The board's common law duty to act fairly was thus influenced by the requirements of art.5(4), and compliance with the former should result in compliance with art.5(4) (see paras [2, 54-63, 103-113](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment). 

(2) In order to comply with common law standards of procedural fairness and to act compatibly with art.5(4) when determining an application for release or transfer to open conditions, the board had to hold an oral hearing whenever fairness to the prisoner required it, _[R. (on the application of Smith) v Parole Board for England and Wales [2005] UKHL 1, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 350, [2005] 1 WLUK 491](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7F2F1DF0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a759282db3a441e28673d406e5f3cf23&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. It was impossible to define exhaustively the circumstances in which an oral hearing would be necessary, but they would include cases in which 

(a) important facts were in dispute or the prisoner advanced significant explanation or mitigation that had to be heard orally in order fairly to determine its credibility; 
(b) it was maintained on tenable grounds that an oral hearing was necessary to enable the prisoner to put his case effectively; 
(c) it would be unfair for a decision to be made on the papers; 
(d) the board could not otherwise fairly make an independent assessment of risk, or the means by which that risk should be managed. 

Thus, an oral hearing had to be held whenever it appeared to the single member considering the application on the papers that the prisoner was potentially suitable for release or transfer to open conditions. However, an oral hearing did not depend on the prisoner establishing that his application stood any particular chance of success. 

The board also had to remember that one of the purposes of an oral hearing was to reflect the prisoner's legitimate interest in participating in the decision. When dealing with a recalled prisoner, the board had to remember that he had been deprived of his freedom; when dealing with a post-tariff, indeterminate-sentence prisoner, the longer the time since the expiry of the tariff, the closer had to be the scrutiny of whether the level of risk was unacceptable. 

The board had to be, and had to appear to be, independent and impartial. It was not to be predisposed to favour the official version of events, and it was to guard against any temptation to refuse oral hearings in order to save time or expense. The board's administrative procedure had to be well adapted to ensuring that an oral hearing was held where necessary, and the current procedural rules were liable to give rise to problems. The rule requiring a single member either to allow an oral hearing or to provisionally decide that the prisoner was unsuitable for release or transfer did not mean that an oral hearing was appropriate only if the single member considered that the prisoner was suitable for release or transfer. 

Moreover, it was important to remember that single-member paper decisions were provisional and the right to request an oral hearing was not a right of appeal. The prisoner did not have to demonstrate that the decision might be wrong, he simply had to persuade the board that an oral hearing was appropriate. Where there was doubt, it would be prudent for the board to allow an oral hearing. Since refusing an oral hearing resulted in the provisional decision becoming final, an oral hearing had to be granted whenever it would be unfair for that to happen. If the prisoner placed into question anything in the provisional decision that might have a significant impact on his future management or reviews, there ought usually to be an oral hearing, even if there was no doubt that he should remain in custody or in closed conditions (paras [2, 73-79, 80-96](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). 

(3) By not offering oral hearings in the instant cases, the board had not complied with the common law requirements of procedural fairness and had failed to act compatibly with art.5(4). However, a breach of the art.5(4) requirements of procedural fairness would not normally result in damages unless the prisoner had suffered a consequent deprivation of liberty (paras [97-100, 113, 115](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
