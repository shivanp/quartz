A, a Turkish citizen, lived in a south eastern province of Turkey which had been subject to emergency rule since 1987. A alleged that he was taken into custody in November 1992 and was tortured by electrocution and by the "Palestinian hanging", such that he lost the movement in his hands and arms. He was diagnosed as suffering from bilateral radial paralysis. The Public Prosecutor decided that there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings against A. A brought no proceedings in Turkey in relation to his alleged ill treatment by the police, but in May 1993 lodged a complaint to the Commission alleging that his torture constituted a violation of [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC7F7C04FC8E44BEC84CB31238C777298/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=10159e63be1b49d99cafbd03155bf4cb&contextData=(sc.Default)). A was shot dead in April 1994, and his representatives alleged that he had received death threats in relation to his application to the Commission. Turkey took a preliminary objection that, contrary to Art.26 of the Convention, A had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him.

Held, awarding A's family damages, that 

(1) Art.26 had to be interpreted flexibly and without excessive formalism. When the Public Prosecutor saw A, he must have been aware that A was paralysed and failed to conduct an inquiry. Special circumstances existed for A, after his period of 14 days in custody, not to exhaust domestic remedies; 

(2) the "Palestinian hanging" which caused paralysis amounted to torture and contravened Art.3; 

(3) 14 days' detention without being brought before a judge amounted to delay which contravened Art.5(3); 

(4) terrorist activity in South East Turkey by the PKK Kurdish Party was such as to create a "public emergency threatening the life of the nation" within the meaning of Art.15 but did not justify 14 days' detention without being brought before the judge; 

(5) the attitude of the Public Prosecutor who ignored clear evidence of torture was tantamount to undermining the effectiveness of any other remedies that may have been open to A, and 

(6) although there was no evidence that A was killed for applying to the Commission, compensation was awarded for the extremely serious violations.
