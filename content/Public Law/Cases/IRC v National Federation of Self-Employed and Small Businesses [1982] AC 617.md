### Abstract

No taxpayer has a sufficient interest in the matter to ask the court to investigate the affairs of another taxpayer or to complain that another taxpayer has been under-assessed. For some years casual workers in Fleet Street had been evading income tax on their earnings by collecting the earnings under false names. Ultimately, the Inland Revenue came to a special arrangement with the workers, employers and unions whereunder (to avoid future loss of tax) the workers were to register, and arrears of tax from 1977/78 were to be paid. However, the Inland Revenue agreed not to proceed with investigations as to tax lost in earlier years. The National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses challenged this "tax amnesty" by seeking an order of mandamus against the Commissioners of Inland Revenue.

Held, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, that the Federation had not sufficient interest in the matter to which the application related within [RSC Ord.53, r.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I94D860C0E4AB11DA9407CBB86AE37856/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ce397bbb050849a2a737bc5b3faba73b&contextData=(sc.Default)) so that an order of mandamus could not be made (_[Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers [1978] A.C. 435, [1977] 7 WLUK 167](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB2E8CE30E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ce397bbb050849a2a737bc5b3faba73b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished; _[R. v Lewisham Union Guardians [1897] 1 Q.B. 498, [1897] 1 WLUK 67](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I55B48690E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ce397bbb050849a2a737bc5b3faba73b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled).
