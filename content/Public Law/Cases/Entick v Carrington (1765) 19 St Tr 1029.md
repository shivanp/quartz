## Facts

On 11 November 1762, the King's Chief Messenger, Nathan Carrington, and three other King's messengers, James Watson, Thomas Ardran, and Robert Blackmore, broke into the home of the Grub Street writer, John Entick (1703?–1773) in the parish of St Dunstan, Stepney “with force and arms”. Over the course of four hours, they broke open locks and doors and searched all of the rooms before taking away 100 charts and 100 pamphlets, causing £2,000 of damage (£413,906 in 2020). The King's messengers were acting on the orders of Lord Halifax, newly appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department, “to make strict and diligent search for … the author, or one concerned in the writing of several weekly very seditious papers entitled, The Monitor, or British Freeholder”.

Entick sued the messengers for trespassing on his land.

## Significance

The judgment established the limits of executive power in English law: the state may act lawfully only in a manner prescribed by statute or common law.

It was also part of the background to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and was described by the Supreme Court of the United States as "a 'great judgment', 'one of the landmarks of English liberty', 'one of the permanent monuments of the British Constitution', and a guide to an understanding of what the Framers meant in writing the Fourth Amendment".
