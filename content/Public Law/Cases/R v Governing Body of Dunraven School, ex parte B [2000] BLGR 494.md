 'B' was permanently excluded from school following the theft of a teacher’s bag, on the basis of the witness statement of another pupil (‘D’). B’s parents were not allowed to see the statement or to know who had made it. The court found that it was not fair for the governors to take into account the written statement of D which B and his parents had not seen, nor the oral evidence of D which B and his parents had not heard. B could not prepare his own case without sight of the substance of D’s evidence.

### Summary

A schoolboy appealed against the dismissal of his challenge to a decision to permanently exclude him from school following an incident of theft. The schoolboy maintained that the school's failure to disclose the contents of a written statement made by another pupil breached the rules of natural justice. The court held that the refusal to disclose the nature of serious allegations made by an accuser, which the school had attempted to justify on the basis of confidentiality, amounted to procedural unfairness.

### Abstract

A schoolboy appealed against the dismissal of his challenge to a decision to permanently exclude him from school following an incident of theft. The boy maintained that the school's failure to disclose the contents of a written statement made by another pupil breached the rules of natural justice.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the refusal to disclose the nature of the serious allegations, which the school had attempted to justify on the basis of confidentiality, amounted to procedural unfairness. B had a right to be heard but that right was of no avail unless he knew what was being said against him.
