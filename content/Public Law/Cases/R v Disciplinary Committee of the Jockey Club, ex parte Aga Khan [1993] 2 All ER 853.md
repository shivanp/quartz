### Abstract

The jockey Club is a private organisation, bound to its members by contract, and therefore the appropriate remedies against it are private law remedies, and there is no scope for judicial review of its decisions. A sought to apply for judicial review of a decision of the Jockey Club, in order to quash a decision that a filly belonging to him should be disqualified for failing a drugs test.

Held, that although the Jockey Club controls most of the racing in the U.K., it is not in any sense an organ of government, and therefore its decisions are not amenable to judicial review ( R. v. C.I.C.B., ex p.
