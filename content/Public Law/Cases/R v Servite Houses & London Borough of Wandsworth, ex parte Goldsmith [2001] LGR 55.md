A housing association was found not to be exercising a public function in the provision of residential care to the elderly. The court reasoned that Wandsworth had discharged its statutory duties once it had arranged for the provision of accommodation by the housing association. The source of the associationâ€™s power was purely contractual, deriving from the commercial relationship it had with Wandsworth, and they were not subject to statutory controls.

### Abstract

SH was a charitable housing association which owned a purpose built residential home. The applicants, G, lived there pursuant to a written placement agreement made between the owners and the local authority pursuant to the [National Assistance Act 1948 s.26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I53635D10E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=314659f4d480487da11d8d3ffcbd56a4&contextData=(sc.Search)). G had been assured that they could remain at the home for the rest of their lives so long as they did not require nursing care. SH found that the home was running at a substantial loss and decided to close it. The High Court refused G's application for judicial review of the decision to close the home but gave them leave to appeal against his decision. G, therefore, sought a mandatory injunction requiring SH to keep the home open until the conclusion of the appeal.

Held, granting the application, that 

(1) the court had to balance all the factors which had been put before it. It was not appropriate in a case such as this for the court to express a view as to the prospects of an appeal being successful but it was a case of considerable importance and the judge had encouraged an appeal; 

(2) the interim relief sought would be over a comparatively short period. If the respondents were successful they would suffer a degree of financial loss. However, the closure of the home would have a catastrophic effect on G, and 

(3) there would be changes of an irreversible nature if an interim injunction was not granted, _[R. v Westminster City Council Ex p.
