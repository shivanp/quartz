### Summary

The Inland Revenue did not have power under the Taxes Management Act 1970 s.1 to make an extra statutory allowance to widowers equivalent to widow's bereavement allowance and therefore did not act unlawfully under the Human Rights Act 1998 s.6(1) when they refused to make such an allowance to widowers because they could not have acted differently and so were protected by s.6(2)(a) of the 1998 Act.

### Abstract

The appellant widower (W) appealed against the decision ([2003] EWCA Civ 814, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 2683, [2003] C.L.Y. 4169]) that he was not entitled to a tax allowance equivalent to the widow's bereavement allowance (abolished in relation to deaths on or after April 6, 2000) to which he would have been entitled as a widow under the [Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 s.262](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I308E4040E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bc6502e7e2a3453f9006c611f338a94e&contextData=(sc.Default)) . After the death of his wife W had complained that United Kingdom tax law, which allowed an income tax reduction to widows but not to widowers, was unfairly discriminatory. After the coming into force of the [Human Rights Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FB840F0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bc6502e7e2a3453f9006c611f338a94e&contextData=(sc.Default)) W made a claim to the Inland Revenue for an allowance under s.262 on the ground that having to pay tax was something which affected a citizen's peaceful enjoyment of his possessions within the meaning of Sch.1 Part II Art.1 and that Sch.1 Part I Art.14 therefore required that in matters of taxation there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex, and that therefore the refusal of an allowance was an unlawful act, or failure to act, by the Revenue under s.6(1) of the 1998 Act. W submitted that 

(1) it was possible to read s.262 as including widowers; 

(2) the Inland Revenue had statutory power to make an allowance to widowers by way of extra statutory concession under the care and management powers contained in the [Taxes Management Act 1970 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFBE30B70E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bc6502e7e2a3453f9006c611f338a94e&contextData=(sc.Default)) ; 

(3) he had been treated unfairly by comparison with other widowers who had received payments from the government after petitioning the European Court of Human Rights. The Inland Revenue submitted that the application of s.6(1) was excluded by s.6(2) because they had no statutory power to make widowers an allowance and so could not have acted differently within the meaning of s.6(2)(a).

Held, dismissing the appeal, that 

(1) it was not possible to read "widow" in s.262 as including "widower" by application of the [Interpretation Act 1978 s.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB48C4C90E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bc6502e7e2a3453f9006c611f338a94e&contextData=(sc.Default)) , since a contrary intention was abundantly clear from the provisions of the 1988 Act. That conclusion was not affected by s.3 of the 1998 Act, which required statutes to be interpreted against a background which included the Convention and an assumption that they were not intended to be incompatible with Convention rights, but did not permit the word "widow" to be interpreted as referring to the more general concept of a surviving spouse. 

(2) The Inland Revenue did not have power under s.1 of the 1970 Act to make an extra statutory allowance to all widowers. They could not exercise their s.1 powers to concede, by extra statutory concession, an allowance which Parliament could have granted but did not grant, and on grounds not of pragmatism in the collection of tax but of general equity between men and women. Therefore the legislation gave the Inland Revenue no power to act otherwise than to disallow claims for allowances by widowers and they were therefore protected by s.6(2)(a). If W had had a cause of action he would not have been entitled to damages because if Parliament had paid proper regard to Art.14, it would have abolished the allowance for widows (as it had later done) rather than extended it to widowers, _[Van Raalte v Netherlands (20060/92) (1997) 24 E.H.R.R. 503, [1997] 2 WLUK 409](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE69FFB80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bc6502e7e2a3453f9006c611f338a94e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. 

(3) The Inland Revenue were not acting irrationally or unfairly abusing their powers by not paying W an allowance since he was not entitled to pecuniary damages and the Inland Revenue was entitled to take that point against W.
