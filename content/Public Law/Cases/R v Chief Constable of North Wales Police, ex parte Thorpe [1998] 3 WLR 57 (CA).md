AB and CB had been released from prison after serving sentences for sexual assaults on children. They were thought still to be dangerous. They moved about the country to escape identification, and came to be staying on a campsite. The police sought to co-operate in the resettlement of the couple, but felt they had to inform the camp-site owner, which they did by revealing the newspaper reports.  

Held: A disclosure of the identity of paedophile offenders to the public by the police, must only be done after opportunity for representations as to the basis of information, but may be appropriate if there can be shown a pressing need.  

There is an acute tension between the interests of a former sex-offender and the interests of the community. Three issues were identified: 

(1) a presumption that information should not be disclosed, recognising (a) the effect on the ability of the convicted people to live a normal life; (b) the risk of violence to them; and (c) that disclosure might drive them underground. 

(2) There is a strong public interest in ensuring that police are able to disclose information about offenders where that is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime, or for the protection of young or other vulnerable people. 

(3) Each case should be considered carefully on its particular facts, assessing the risk posed by the individual offender; the vulnerability of those who may be at risk; and the impact of disclosure on the offender. In making such assessment, the police should normally consult other relevant agencies (such as social services and the probation service).  

Lord Bingham CJ said: 
> ‘When, in the course of performing its public duties, a public body (such as a police force) comes into possession of information relating to a member of the public, being information not generally available and potentially damaging to that member of the public if disclosed, the body ought not to disclose such information save for the purpose of and to the extent necessary for performance of its public duty or enabling some other public body to perform its public duty.’  

and 
> ‘Each case must be judged on its own facts. However, in doing this, it must be remembered that the decision to which the police have to come as to whether or not to disclose the identity of paedophiles to members of the public, is a highly sensitive one. Disclosure should only be made when there is a pressing need for that disclosure. Before reaching their decision as to whether to disclose, the police require as much information as can reasonably practicably be obtained in the circumstances. In the majority of the situations which can be anticipated, it will be obvious that the subject of the possible disclosure will often be in the best position to provide information which will be valuable when assessing the risk.’  

As to article 8: 
> ‘Both under the Convention and as a matter of English administrative law, the police are entitled to use information when they reasonably conclude this is what is required (after taking into account the interests of the applicants), in order to protect the public and in particular children. However, where the use in question is decided upon as a result of the exercise of an honest judgment of professional police officers, that will, of itself, go a long way to establish its reasonableness.’  

Buxton J said: 
> ‘I do however consider that a wish that certain facts in one’s past, however notorious at the time, should remain in that past is an aspect of the subject’s private life sufficient at least to raise questions under article 8 of the Convention.’
