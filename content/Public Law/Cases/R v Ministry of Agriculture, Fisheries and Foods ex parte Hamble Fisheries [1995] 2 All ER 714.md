The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food declined A's request for a licence for its vessel to beam trawl for pressure stock in the North Sea because of changes in governmental policy prohibiting the aggregation of transferable licence entitlements by which method A had anticipated securing the licence. A applied for judicial review of that decision, contending that by the date of the change of policy it had had a legitimate expectation that any change in licensing policy would not be such as to frustrate the completion of the process of licence aggregation for the trawler, entitling it to trawl for pressure stock in the North Sea and, further, that proper pipeline provisions should have been included in the new policy of licensing by track record in favour of fishermen who had irrevocably entered commitments to acquire beam trawl licences and who had demonstrated a real and genuine intent to do so.

Held, dismissing the application, that 

(1) legitimacy was a function of expectations induced by government and of policy considerations which militated against their fulfilment. The balance in the first instance was for the policy-maker to strike but if the outcome was challenged by judicial review, the court's criterion was not the bare rationality of the policy-maker's conclusion and its task was not only to recognise the constitutional importance of ministerial freedom to formulate and to reformulate policy, but also to protect the interests of those individuals whose expectation of different treatment had a legitimacy which in fairness outweighed the policy choice which threatened to frustrate it; but 

(2) in the circumstances, fairness did not require the perceived need for a swift limitation of North Sea beam trawling for pressure stock to be sacrificed in favour of a class whose expectations, however reasonable and however genuine, might well have eventually subverted the policy; and 

(3) while the framer of a policy for the exercise of a governmental discretion should be prepared to consider making exceptions where those were merited, it would always be a legitimate consideration that to make one such exception could set up an unanswerable case of partiality or arbitrariness, and he had to balance the case for making no such exception against the case for generalising it.
