**Facts:** A ban was imposed by the local authority on Leicester Rugby Club, which prevented the club from using the City Council's Welford Road ground for its matches. The ban had been introduced because three Leicester players intended to play in an unofficial tour of South Africa (during the period of the ‘apartheid’ regime in that country.)

**Held:** The ban was an improper use of statutory power and had the effect of punishing the club unfairly. The House of Lords also found the decision to be 'Wednesbury unreasonable'. According to Lord Roskill, although the decision was 'Wednesbury unreasonable', it was far from clear that it was illogical or immoral. However, he did feel that the policy was unreasonably punitive on the club which had remained neutral on the matter.
