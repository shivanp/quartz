**Facts:** A solicitor had been appointed by the District Council to prosecute the defendant for breaching enforcement notices. The solicitor reached a settlement with the defendant's lawyer, under which he agreed to the withdrawal of the enforcement notices.

**Held:** The court held that the solicitor had not been given actual authority by the council to do so. Neither did he have 'ostensible authority', as it did not lie within the usual authority of a solicitor acting in these circumstances. Therefore, the Council was not bound.

### Abstract

F appealed against a decision ([2001] 4 P.L.R. 110) allowing an appeal by the local authority from a judgment in which it had been found to be estopped from bringing proceedings against F under the [Town and Country Planning Act 1990 s.187B](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I11BDF4C0E44C11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f8cd773d5d044f9b8d27c26cb992baf6&contextData=(sc.Default)). F, relying on the finding of fact by the trial judge that the local authority's solicitor had agreed to withdraw two enforcement notices, contended that he had a legitimate expectation that the local authority would not seek compliance with the notices by way of an injunction.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that a legitimate expectation in respect of a representation said to have been made on behalf of a public body could only arise where the person making the representation had had actual or ostensible authority to make such representations on behalf of the public body. In light of the fact that enforcement notices were important public documents which ran with the land and were enforceable against subsequent owners or occupiers, authority to withdraw them could not reasonably be regarded as attaching to those who had conduct of prosecutions for breach. In the instant case, the local authority's solicitor lacked the requisite authority to agree to withdraw the enforcement notices, therefore the local authority were not prevented from seeking an injunction.
