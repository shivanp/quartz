The applicant was detained in HM Prison, Barlinnie in Glasgow. He complained about the lack of toilet facilities and the small size of the cell, which exacerbated his facial eczema.

The court held that the conditions of detention endured by the applicant and their effect on his physical health amounted to degrading treatment and were a violation of article 3. While it was impractical to move him and all the other prisoners enduring similar conditions to a different prison, the applicant was entitled to have his case for removal considered on an individual basis.

In proceedings for judicial review brought by N, a prisoner, the Lord Ordinary found that S, the Scottish Ministers, had acted unlawfully in terms of the [Human Rights Act 1998 s.6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B278DA1E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8c386121f3dc49c78c3a579aa2baa309&contextData=(sc.Default)) and ultra vires in terms of the [Scotland Act 1998 s.57](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2004C521E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8c386121f3dc49c78c3a579aa2baa309&contextData=(sc.Default)) , by acting in a manner incompatible with Sch.1 Part I Art.3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and detaining N in conditions in which he was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. N was awarded damages. S reclaimed. The only issue debated was the appropriate standard of proof to be applied in civil domestic proceedings in determining whether or not there had been a breach of Art.3.

Held, granting declarator, that in civil proceedings in which a finding was sought that there had been an act or a failure to act by a public authority which was incompatible with Art.3, the appropriate standard of proof was proof on a balance of probabilities.
