### Abstract

P, a university lecturer, applied for judicial review of the interpretation by the Visitor of the University of Hull (V) of the university statutes in relation to his dismissal by reason of redundancy. The Divisional Court held that it had jurisdiction to review V's decision and that V had misconstrued the statutes in allowing P's dismissal. The Court of Appeal agreed with the decision on jurisdiction but decided that V's construction of the university statutes was correct. P appealed against the decision on the interpretation of the statutes, and the university and V cross-applied against the decision on jurisdiction.

Held: The court had no jurisdiction to review V's decision since the law which was being applied was not the general law of the land but the domestic law of the university, of which V was the sole arbiter (Lord Mustill and Lord Slynn dissenting). The court could not review V's decision for error of law committed within his jurisdiction, but would have jurisdiction to review where V acted outside his jurisdiction, abused his powers or acted in breach of the rules of natural justice.
