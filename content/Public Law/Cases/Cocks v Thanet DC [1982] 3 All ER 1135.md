### Abstract

An unsuccessful applicant for permanent housing under the [Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID3846310A36411DFBD5BDFC95D1AB45D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e547c6b5d003449cbbae1ab441b352af&contextData=(sc.Default)) alleges a breach by a council of its duty to house him should proceed by an application for judicial review. In September 1981 C applied to D, the council, for permanent accommodation for himself and his family. D provided temporary accommodation until December 1981. In January 1982 C started proceedings against D in the county court for a declaration that D was in breach of its duty under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. The court had to determine whether C was entitled to proceed with his claim in the county court or should instead apply for judicial review under the [Rules of the Supreme Court Ord.53](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I94D860C0E4AB11DA9407CBB86AE37856/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e547c6b5d003449cbbae1ab441b352af&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, that as a general rule, which applied where a plaintiff was forced to impugn a public authority's determination as a condition precedent to enforcing his private law rights, it is contrary to public policy and an abuse of process to allow a person to proceed by way of an ordinary action to establish that a public authority's decision infringed rights entitled to protection under public law. Therefore, as an unsuccessful applicant for permanent accommodation alleging a breach by the council of its duty to house him which only arose after a public law determination, C was not entitled to challenge the alleged breach by way of action but should proceed instead by an application for judicial review (_[O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] 2 A.C. 237, [1982] 11 WLUK 222](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I11E00610E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e547c6b5d003449cbbae1ab441b352af&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
