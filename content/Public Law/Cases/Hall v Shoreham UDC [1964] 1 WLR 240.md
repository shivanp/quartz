1. Where plaintiffs are granted conditional planning permission by a defendant U.D.C. the conditions are void for unreasonableness where they require the plaintiffs to construct a road on their own land and virtually dedicate it to the public without compensation, while a more regular course for constructing a road at public expense with compensation payable is open to the defendants under the Highways Act 1959. 
2. Where conditions fundamental to the grant of planning permission are void, the grant of such permission is itself void. The plaintiffs were granted planning permission by the defendant U.D.C. subject to conditions, two of which required the plaintiffs, in effect, to build a road on their own land at their own expense and allow the public a right of way over it. There was an alternative course which could have been pursued by the defendants under the Highways Act 1959, for obtaining land as the site of the road and for constructing the road thereon.

Held, allowing both the plaintiffs' appeal and the defendants' cross-appeal, 

(1) (Harman L.J. dissenting as to condition 3) that neither condition was void for uncertainty; 

(2) that both conditions were ultra vires and void for unreasonableness; but 

(3) the conditions being fundamental to the grant of planning permission, such grant was itself also void.
