Facts: Under s. 1(1) of the Sunday Entertainments Act 1932 local authorities were given the power to allow venues to show films on Sundays ‘subject to such conditions as the authority thinks fit to impose’. The Picture House was granted a licence to open on Sundays, but the local authority granted this subject to the condition that no children under the age of 15 would be admitted on a Sunday.

Held: In his judgment, Lord Greene MR said that the physical and moral health of children was a matter which a local authority, in exercising its powers, could properly have in mind when considering what condition should be attached to the grant of a licence. The Picture House therefore failed in its challenge. However, Lord Greene found that: 
> ‘…if a decision on a competent matter is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it, then the courts can interfere…

He added:
> ‘…to prove a case of that kind would require something overwhelming, and in this case, the facts do not come anywhere near anything of that kind’.

In the _Wednesbury_ case Lord Greene stressed that it was not for a court to intervene simply because it has a different opinion on a matter of policy to that of the decision-maker under challenge.

### Summary

Where a public authority making a decision had only taken into account the matters it ought to have taken into account, the court could still interfere with the decision where it was so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it. This case is the basis for the terms “Wednesbury reasonableness” and “Wednesbury unreasonableness”.

### Abstract

The appellant cinema proprietor (P) appealed against a decision (_Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1947] 1 All E.R. 498_) that a condition imposed by the respondent local licensing authority on the grant of permission for Sunday performances at the cinema was not ultra vires.

The local authority was empowered by the [Sunday Entertainments Act 1932 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I403B5760E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8fa3b3749581492daef4ba05b1c6c8cb&contextData=(sc.Default)) to licence cinema performances "subject to such conditions as the authority think fit to impose". Taking into account the well-being and physical and moral health of children likely to visit the cinema, it imposed a condition that no child under 15 should be admitted to such performances, whether accompanied by an adult or not. P brought an action for a declaration that the condition was ultra vires, but its action was dismissed.

P argued that the local authority had acted unreasonably in imposing the condition.

### Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The court was entitled to investigate the local authority's actions to see whether it had taken into account matters which it ought not to have taken into account, or had failed to take into account matters which it ought to have taken into account. If that question was answered in the local authority's favour, it might still be possible to say that although it had kept within the matters, it ought to have considered the conclusion reached was so unreasonable that no reasonable local authority could ever have come to it. In those circumstances, the court could interfere with the discretion. The court's power to interfere was not as an appellate authority to override the decision of a local authority, but as a judicial authority which was only concerned to see whether the local authority had contravened the law by acting in excess of its powers.

(2) In the instant case, the matter dealt with by the condition was one which a reasonable authority would be justified in considering when deciding what condition should be attached to the grant of the licence.

(3) (Obiter) The decision of the majority in _[Theatre De Luxe (Halifax) Ltd v Gledhill [1915] 2 K.B. 49, [1914] 12 WLUK 68](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICF167070E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8fa3b3749581492daef4ba05b1c6c8cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ had put much too narrow a construction on the licensing power given by the [Cinematograph Act 1909](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6DC3AA50BFAB11E4B788835A15683B78/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8fa3b3749581492daef4ba05b1c6c8cb&contextData=(sc.Default)), Theatre de Luxe considered.
