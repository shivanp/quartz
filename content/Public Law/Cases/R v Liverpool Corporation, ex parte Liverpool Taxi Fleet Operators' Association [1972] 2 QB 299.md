#### Facts
A decision was made to increase the number of taxi licences in Liverpool despite assurances to the contrary from the Liverpool Corporation. The Association, a representative group of taxi drivers, sought to review that decision. A key question for the court was whether the group, as opposed to the individual members of the group who were directly affected, had standing.

#### Held
The court held that the Association should have standing. There was a logical connection between the Association and the decision under challenge because its members were all affected.
