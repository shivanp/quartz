In 1954 the Minister of Agriculture, Sir Thomas Dugdale, resigned following an official inquiry about the approach of the Ministry of Agriculture in disposing of land no longer needed by the Air Ministry after the Second World War. In the Commons debate on the inquiry's report the minister said—

> "I, as Minister, must accept full responsibility to Parliament for any mistakes and inefficiency of officials in my Department, just as, when my officials bring off any successes on my behalf, I take full credit for them … any departure from this long-established rule is bound to bring the civil service right into the political arena, and that we should all, on both sides of the House, deprecate most vigorously".[8]

The Crichel Down episode is perhaps most useful in constitutional terms because of the four categories drawn up by the Home Secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, to distinguish the degree of accountability of ministers for their civil servants

N.B. Crichel Down also led the government to promote a wide-ranging 'judicialisation' of many aspects of the administrative process, creating tight legislative rules for executive bodies to follow and more appeal tribunals
