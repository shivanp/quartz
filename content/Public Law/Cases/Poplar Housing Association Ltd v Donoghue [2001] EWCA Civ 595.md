### Summary

The making of a mandatory order for possession in respect of an assured shorthold tenancy did not breach the tenant's human rights.

### Abstract

D, a tenant, appealed against a possession order under the [Housing Act 1988 s.21](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I73BA4BC0E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bbb9bf6d2bef4df9aff1a79903579758&contextData=(sc.Default)) granted in favour of her landlord, P, a housing association, which had been created by the local authority to take over part of its housing stock. D contended that the hearing should have been adjourned so that she could adduce fresh evidence as to whether P was a public body for the purposes of a declaration of incompatibility and whether the mandatory nature of s.21 of the 1988 Act constituted a breach of her right to family life under the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bbb9bf6d2bef4df9aff1a79903579758&contextData=(sc.Default)) and her right to a fair trial under Art.6.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the judge had been correct not to adjourn the hearing as otherwise he would have contravened the clear terms of s.21(4) of the 1988 Act. Although it was not necessarily the case that a body performing a duty that otherwise would be required of a local authority was performing a public function, in the instant case P was so closely identified with the local authority that it was performing public functions. Section 21(4) was not incompatible with D's right to family life nor with Art.6. The lack of judicial discretion under s.21(4) was necessary in the public interest to provide a certain procedure to recover possession of property following termination of a shorthold tenancy. The question of whether it was legitimate and proportional was one for Parliament to decide. The correct procedure on an application for a declaration of incompatibility was to give as much informal notice to the Crown as practicable and also to send a copy of the informal notice to the relevant court and to the other party.
