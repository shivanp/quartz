Section 4(4) of the Foreign Compensation Act 1950 provided that: 
> “The determination by the commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law”.

Anisminic Ltd. wished to challenge a decision of the FCC on the basis that it had misconstrued the legal effect of the statutory framework under which it operated. The law lords held that the ouster clause did not prevent it from challenging the FCC's decision. Lord Reid stated that:

> “It is a well-established principle that a provision ousting the ordinary jurisdiction of the court must be construed strictly — meaning, I think, that, if such a provision is reasonably capable of having two meanings, that meaning shall be taken which preserves the ordinary jurisdiction of the court.”

## Case Digest

The [Foreign Compensation Act 1950 s.4(4)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5EF82570E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=94fe6a9591704361946832f34b23883f&contextData=(sc.Search)) does not preclude the court from inquiring whether an order of the Commission is a nullity. 

A Co applied to the Foreign Compensation Commission claiming it was entitled to share in the Egyptian Compensation Fund in respect of certain property sequestrated by Egypt in 1956. The Commission provisionally determined that A had failed to establish a claim under the relevant Order. A Co brought an action for declarations that the provisional determination was a nullity and that A Co was entitled to participate in the fund. A Co contended that the Commission had misconstrued the Order in finding that an Egyptian organisation to whom A Co had sold the property in 1957 was A Co's successor in title. 

On A Co's appeal to the House of Lords, held (Lord Morris of Borthy-Gest dissenting),

(1) that s.4(4) of the Act (which says that ==the determination== by the Commission of any application made to them under the Act shall not be called in question in any court of law) should not be construed as including everything which ==purported to be a determination== but was not in fact one because the Commission had misconstrued the Order defining its jurisdiction; 

(2) (Lord Pearce dissenting) that the Commission had acted outside its jurisdiction when it considered whether A Co had a successor in title and so misconstrued Art.4 of the Order. Appeal allowed. Declarations accordingly.
