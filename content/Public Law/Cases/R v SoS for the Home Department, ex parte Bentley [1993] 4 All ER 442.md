Concerned a challenge to the Home Secretary's decision not to grant Derek Bentley a posthumous pardon. He had been hanged for murder in 1953 after a conviction in circumstances which several decades later were viewed as amounting to a serious miscarriage of justice.

Again the court dismissed the government's argument that the matter was entirely non-justiciable, based on Lord Roskill's concerns a decade before. His concerns were classified by the court as having been obiter and therefore non-binding.

The court distinguished between full pardons, which they saw to be an issue of higher policy, (only to be granted if the person concerned was now seen as 'morally and technically innocent'), and other considerations which the Home Secretary could have taken into account. These, including the availability of conditional pardons, were not seen to be beyond the courts' remit and so his failure to consider such an outcome was criticised. 

> '[A]s the argument before us developed, it became clear that the substance of the applicant's case was that the Home Secretary failed to recognise the fact that the prerogative of mercy is capable of being exercised in many different circumstances and over a wide range and therefore failed to consider the form of pardon which might be appropriate to meet the facts of the present case. Such a failure is, we think, reviewable.'
