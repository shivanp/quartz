Where it is provided by statute that the decision of a court of law is to be final, as opposed to that of a tribunal of limited jurisdiction, no distinction can be drawn between appeals as to law as opposed to fact, nor between questions of law going to jurisdiction as opposed to other questions of law. The DPP sought an order under the [Companies Act 1948 s.441](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I200F7A207E3111E496F7A0A22A1980EC/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=20709ffd9c104985a77fd1ec2c1e3a3f&contextData=(sc.Default)) for inspection of X Co's books, on the ground that a subordinate manager was believed to have obtained money from the company's customers by fraudulent means, the company benefiting therefrom. The High Court judge dismissed the application on the ground that s.441 was limited to breaches of law regulating the management of the company's affairs. The Court of Appeal entertained an appeal despite the provision of s.441(3) that the decision of a judge of the High Court should not be appealable, on the ground that the judge had made an error of law which went to jurisdiction, and reversed his decision. On appeal by X Co., held, allowing the appeal, that where it was provided by statute that the decision of a court of law should be final, as opposed to that of a tribunal of limited jurisdiction, no distinction could be drawn between appeals as to law as opposed to fact, nor between questions of law going to jurisdiction as opposed to other of law. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.
