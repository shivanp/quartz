The applicants were prison inmates whose correspondence was stopped by the prison authorities. They alleged that the control of their mail gave rise to breaches of art 6(1) and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights held that the first applicant was denied access to a court and there was a breach of art 6(1) of the Convention, as his petitions for permission to seek legal advice had been refused. The stopping of letters was clearly an interference with the applicantsâ€™ rights under art 8 of the Convention and as to 57 letters was not necessary in a democratic society.
