As part of its policy to promote B.A., (then the nationalised airline), the Department of Trade cancelled Freddie Laker's "Skytrain" approval or 'designation' under the Bermuda Agreement.

This was sharply criticised by Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal, who saw the purpose of the action taken under the prerogative to be sharply at odds with the statutory requirements in the Civil Aviation Act 1971 for revoking airline designations.

> "Seeing that these statutory means were available for stopping Skytrain if there was a proper case for it, the question is whether the Secretary of State can stop it by other means. Can he do it by withdrawing the designation? Can he do indirectly that which he cannot do directly? Can he displace the statute by invoking a prerogative?
> 
> If he could do this, it would mean by a side wind, Laker Airways Ltd would be deprived of the protection that statute affords them. There would be no hearing, no safeguard against injustice â€¦ To my mind, such a procedure was never contemplated by the statute."

## Case Digest

The Secretary of State for Trade cannot lawfully formulate new policy, or issue a mandatory direction by the procedure of "guidance" to the Civil Aviation Authority under the [Civil Aviation Act 1971 s.3(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDA1D1880930E11E0B93BEE41A35EC0EF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4aac79c4913f4744a44b25230cdc9f36&contextData=(sc.Default)). The Civil Aviation Authority granted Laker Airways a licence for 10 years from 1973 for a cheap passenger service between the UK and the USA called "Skytrain." Laker Airways was then designated as an airline under the Bermuda Agreement 1946. In 1976 the Secretary of State for Trade announced by a White Paper (Cmnd. 6400) that future policy would be to license only one UK airline on any given long route. Paras. 7 and 8 contained an instruction to the Civil Aviation Authority to revoke the licence for Skytrain. Laker Airways claimed in a quia timet action for declarations that paras.7 and 8 were ultra vires and that the Secretary of State was not entitled to withdraw their designation. 

Mocatta, J. granted the declarations sought, holding that Act fettered the Crown's prerogative to withdraw the designation, and that in any event the Secretary of State was estopped by his previous conduct from doing so. On appeal by the Department of Trade, held, dismissing the appeal, 
(1) that the plaintiffs could not invoke the doctrine of estoppel, but 
(2) the plaintiffs were entitled to the declarations sought, since the Secretary of State could not lawfully use the procedure of "guidance" for the formulation of policy, or the issuing of mandatory directions.
