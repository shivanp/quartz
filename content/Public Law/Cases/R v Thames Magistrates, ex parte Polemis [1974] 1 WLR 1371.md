The unreasonable refusal of an adjournment to enable a defendant to prepare his case may amount to a denial of natural justice. D, a ship's master, was summonsed at 10.30 a.m., returnable at 2 p.m. the same day, charging him with discharging oil into navigable waters. He was refused an adjournment to prepare his defence and, in particular, to analyse the oil samples allegedly discharged by him.

Held, 
(1) that the refusal of an adjournment had amounted to a breach of natural justice as D had been unable to present his case; 
(2) that certiorari would lie to quash the conviction as the central ground was the refusal of the adjournment rather than the breach of natural justice.
