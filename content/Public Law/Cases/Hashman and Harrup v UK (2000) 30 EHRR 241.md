Two hunt saboteurs whose appeals against binding over orders and payment orders of GBP 100 were dismissed, applied to the European Court of Human Rights, complaining that their rights to freedom of expression, as guaranteed under the [European Convention on Human Rights Art.10](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAE7756732A7B4BBC93274BDE4496FB0F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=583921eabd4e48029f7708c83ef38ad0&contextData=(sc.Default)) , had been violated. H contended that the description of his behaviour as being contra bonos mores was so broadly defined that it failed to comply with the requirement in Art.10(2) that any interference with freedom of expression must be "prescribed by law".

Held, granting the application, that the order by which the applicants were bound over was not legally prescribed as required under Art.10(2). Any interference with the freedom of expression necessitated the utmost scrutiny, _[Steel v United Kingdom (24838/94) (1999) 28 E.H.R.R. 603, [1998] 9 WLUK 214](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBE8CBC50E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=583921eabd4e48029f7708c83ef38ad0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished on the grounds that, although "lawfulness" under Art.5(1) was seen as similar to the requirement that interference be "prescribed by law", the applicants in Steel had breached the peace unlike the applicants in the instant case. The court disagreed with the UK Government that the definition of behaviour contra bonos mores as "wrong rather than right in the judgment of the majority of contemporary fellow citizens" contained an objective element equivalent to conduct "likely to cause annoyance". It simply meant conduct expressed to be wrong in the opinion of a majority of citizens.
