Under terrorist legislation applicable in Northern Ireland in the 1970s, an arrest merely required 'suspicion' of an offence on the part of the police, rather than 'reasonable suspicion'. The three applicants had been arrested on suspicion of being terrorists. They complained that the real purpose of the arrest had been to try to gather information from them.

The ECtHR held that, even under an emergency situation, the first limb of article 5(1)(c) required there to be reasonable suspicion, meaning that there had to be evidence of 'facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offenceâ€™.

It was not enough, in itself, that two of the suspects had previous convictions for terrorism. No further material had been provided upon which a suspicion could be founded. Under these circumstances, the arrests had been carried out contrary to article 5(1).

The three applicants were arrested under the [Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 s.11(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAEC728A2B7DC11DF813FC6FD5848E001/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9f53475061764c9d9717d54f786e82b0&contextData=(sc.Search))(now repealed), which provided that "any constable may arrest without warrant any person whom he suspects of being a terrorist". They were detained and questioned, but no charges were brought. They complained that their arrest and detention violated the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights Art.5.

Held, that Art.5(1) of the Convention had been violated, as evidence had not been produced which was capable of satisfying the court that the arrested people were reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offences. The fact that two of the applicants were convicted in 1979 for terrorist offences could not form the sole basis of suspicion justifying their arrest seven years later. Since the applicants had no enforceable right to compensation for breach of Art.5(1) before the Northern Ireland courts, Art.5(5) of the Convention was also violated.
