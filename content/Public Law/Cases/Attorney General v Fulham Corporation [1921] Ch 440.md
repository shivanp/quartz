A local authority had the power to provide washhouses for residents to wash their clothes in. This was later held not to empower it to set up a laundry service in which residents paid employees of the authority to wash their clothes for them. The court held that the local authority had acted ‘outside of the four corners of the Act’ when setting up this service.

**Facts:** 

Baths and Wash-houses Act 1846 gave the Fulham Corporation power to establish washhouses. The Corporation operated washhouses with 60 troughs where people could bring in their laundry with their own soap and have it washed. However, the washing scheme changed in 1920. Under the new scheme customer had to buy a bag to put the clothes in. Then he had to leave that bag of clothes with the Corporation and return for it after the washhouse employee washed them. Until the return what happened to the clothes was out of his control.

**Issue:** 

In Attorney-General v Fulham Corporation, Attorney General challenged the legality of the new scheme and applied for an injunction to restrain its operations.

**Held:**

The Attorney-General’ claim succeeded. Above all, the court held that the Corporation had gone beyond its statutory duty in that it was subsidising its operations with the ratepayers’ money. Therefore, the court granted injunction. ‘That is an instance… in which operations are conducted by persons who have not their own pockets to consider, but who have behind them what they regard as the unlimited or nearly unlimited purse of the ratepayers.’ There was breach of a fiduciary duty.
