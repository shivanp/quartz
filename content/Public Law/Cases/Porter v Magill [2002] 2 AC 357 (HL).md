### Summary

The promotion and implementation by councillors of a policy involving the sale of council houses in order to achieve a political advantage in circumstances where the councillors had been told that the implementation of such a policy would prevent the local authority from meeting its statutory housing obligations amounted to wilful misconduct for which the councillors were liable in damages.

### Abstract

M, the council auditor, appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal ([2000] 2 W.L.R. 1420) allowing the appeals of P and W, the former leader and deputy leader respectively of Westminster City Council, against a decision ((1998) 30 H.L.R. 997) upholding the issue of a certificate by M pursuant to the [Local Government Finance Act 1982 s.20](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA0087CE0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e7c1ffb744074215aa963202093d138b&contextData=(sc.Search)) following a finding of wilful misconduct. M had found that P and W had formulated and implemented a policy whereby council homes would be sold in marginal wards for the purpose of increasing the number of voters in those wards likely to vote for the Conservative Party, that P and W had known that the policy was unlawful, and that the policy had caused financial loss to the council. P and W contended that 

(1) they had acted in accordance with legal advice and accordingly were not guilty of wilful misconduct; 

(2) the existence of an improper motive did not render the decision of the housing committee to implement the policy unlawful, since the committee had reached its decision independently and by applying lawful housing objectives, and 

(3) they had been denied a fair trial since M was not an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of the [Human Rights Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FB840F0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e7c1ffb744074215aa963202093d138b&contextData=(sc.Search)) Sch.1 Part I Art.6. Further, that in view of a statement M had made at a press conference, there was an inference of apparent bias and that there had been an unreasonable delay of eight years between the first objection and the judgment of the Divisional Court.

### Held

Appeal allowed.

Held, allowing the appeal and upholding the certificate, that powers conferred on local authority councillors had to be used for the purposes for which they were conferred and use for unauthorised purposes amounted to misconduct. Where such misconduct was knowing or reckless, it constituted wilful misconduct and if it resulted in loss the councillors concerned could be liable to compensate the council for such loss pursuant to s.20 of the 1982 Act. Whilst it was inevitable that councillors would act in a manner which they hoped would strengthen their position with the electorate, P and W had used their powers purely to promote electoral advantage which was an abuse of their powers. In relation to the contentions of P and W: 

(1) reliance on legal advice was not a defence to a finding of wilful misconduct; 

(2) the majority of members of the housing committee had had insufficient knowledge of the rationale behind the housing policy to enable them to make an informed judgment with the consequence that the causal link between the conduct of P and W and its consequences had not been broken, and 

(3) given the existence, by virtue of s.20(3), of a power of the court to hold a complete rehearing, the various functions of the auditor as investigator, prosecutor and judge did not constitute a breach of Art.6(1). The test to be applied for determining the existence of apparent bias was whether a fair minded and informed observer would conclude that there was a real possibility of bias. Applying such test, P's claim was unsubstantiated and, in view of the nature of the investigation, the delay was not unreasonable.
