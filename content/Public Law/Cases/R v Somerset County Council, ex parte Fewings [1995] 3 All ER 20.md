SCC appealed against a ruling in the Queens Bench Division (Times, February 10, 1994; [1995] 1 All E.R. 513) that its decision to ban hunting on council owned land was unlawful.

Held: Appeal dismissed (Simon Brown L.J. dissenting). Any decision about the management of council land had to be taken on the basis of the statutory objectives specified in the [Local Government Act 1972 s.120](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2127E860E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2a5879e520a740f299e7985b850904d4&contextData=(sc.Default)) , i.e. for the benefit of the local area. A local authority did not have the same freedom as other landowners to permit or forbid activities on its land but was subject to constraints on its statutory powers. The court had been wrong to hold that moral considerations were necessarily irrelevant to the question of what would benefit the area. However, when debating any issue councillors should be reminded that the benefit of the area was the statutory basis for their decision and must understand that, however strongly held their personal views, they had to consider the proposals in terms of benefit and detriment to the area.
