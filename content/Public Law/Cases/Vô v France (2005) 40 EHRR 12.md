V complained that the termination of her pregnancy as the result of clinical negligence had breached the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1B58031DEC86485FA3AEEFBD8980CD10/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7bea79e2a7aa49e48ccd2509def095c9&contextData=(sc.Search)). V had been mistaken for another patient with the same name and subjected to a clinical procedure to remove a coil. During the procedure, the doctor negligently pierced the amniotic sac, necessitating the termination. V made a criminal complaint, but the doctor was acquitted on the ground that, under French law, a foetus was not a living person but rather an extension of the mother's body.

Held, refusing to uphold the complaint, that Art.2 did not confer a right to life that extended to a foetus and there was no relevant case law to determine when life began for the purposes of Art.2. Given the wide degree of variance on the point in the domestic law of Contracting States, determination of the commencement of life came within the margin of appreciation. Although V had chosen to make a criminal complaint, she could have sought damages in the administrative courts, which would have provided an appropriate remedy in French law that V was entitled to take on behalf of her unborn child.
