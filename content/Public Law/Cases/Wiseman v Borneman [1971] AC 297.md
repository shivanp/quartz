It is not contrary to natural justice for a tribunal acting under the [Finance Act 1960 s.28](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I86E8C170E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4e4a8247bed44e11ac73d9b33c06592e&contextData=(sc.Default)) to refuse to let a taxpayer see and answer the Commissioners' counter-statement before deciding that there is a prima facie case for him to answer. In 1967 the Commissioners issued notifications to W under s.28 of the Act (countering a tax advantage) in respect of certain transactions carried out by him. W delivered to them a statutory declaration under s.28(4). The Commissioners prepared a counter-statement and delivered both to the tribunal, as required by s.28(5)(a), with their certificate that they saw reason to take further action. By s.28(5)(b) the tribunal was to consider these documents and determine whether there was a prima facie case for proceeding in the matter. On appeal to the House of Lords, held that in following the procedure laid down by the Act and in not extending it so as to give W a right to see and answer the counter-statement, the tribunal was not acting unfairly or contrary to the rules of natural justice. Appeal dismissed.

Per Lords Reid, Morris of Borth-y-Gest and Wilberforce: it is open to the tribunal in exceptional cases if it sees fit to extend the right to see and answer the counterstatement to a taxpayer. Per Lords Guest, Donovan and Wilberforce: there is no difference in principle so far as observance of the rules of natural justice is concerned between decisions which are final and those which are not.
