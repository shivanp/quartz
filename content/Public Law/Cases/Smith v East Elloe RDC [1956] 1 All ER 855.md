### Abstract

The [Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Act 1946 Sch.I Part IV para.15](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60AEAEE0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=70383606e9354cff890002eabf6974fd&contextData=(sc.Default)) provides: 
> "If any person aggrieved by a compulsory purchase order desires to question the validity thereof ... on the ground that the authorisation of a compulsory purchase thereby granted is not empowered to be granted under this Act ... he may, within six weeks from the date on which notice of the confirmation or making of the order . . . is first published ... make an application to the High Court ..." 
> 

Para.16 provides: 
> "Subject to the provisions of the last foregoing paragraph, a compulsory purchase order ... shall not ... be questioned in any legal proceedings whatsoever..." > 

Para.15 does not cover a case in which all the requirements expressly laid down by statute have been observed but the person aggrieved has discovered, that in carrying out the steps laid down by statute the authority has been actuated by improper motives. The appellant sought a declaration that an order for compulsory purchase of her property had been confirmed wrongfully and in bad faith. She issued a writ against, inter alios, the respondents, the local council, the clerk to the council, and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.

Held, 

(1) the action might proceed against the clerk to the council; 

(2) (Lord Reid and Lord Somervell of Harrow dissenting) the action could not proceed against the other respondents because of the clear prohibition in para.16; 

(3) (Lord Radcliffe dissenting) para.15 did not enable the appellant to challenge the good faith of what had been done.
