### Abstract

The needs of a disabled person had to be assessed with reference to the available resources and the eligibility criteria for services could change according to the authority's financial position. G appealed against a Court of Appeal ruling allowing B's appeal against the refusal of a declaration that G was not entitled to take into account costs and available resources in assessing whether, under the [Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 s.2(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFABCB3E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=baad27f470df4b3586801fb37a6b81a2&contextData=(sc.Default)) , a person had a need and whether it was necessary to make arrangements to meet that need. B, an elderly and severely disabled man, had his home help services provided by G reduced on financial grounds and contended that as his needs had not changed since he was assessed, G were under a statutory duty to provide the services necessary to meet those needs and were not entitled to take financial considerations into account when carrying out their duty.

Held, allowing the appeal, that B's contention was mistaken in that it failed to recognise that needs could not be properly assessed without some reference to the cost of providing for them. In deciding whether a disabled person needed assistance, and if so, what type, it was necessary to apply some criteria and this included the matching of the severity of a disability against the availability of resources. The significance to be attached to the cost of providing services had to include an evaluation of the impact the cost would have on the local authority and the eligibility criteria for services might properly be made more or less stringent depending on the authority's financial position. It was unlikely, particularly in view of the extensive list of facilities included in s.2(1)(a) to 2(1)(h), that Parliament intended that needs must be assessed and services provided regardless of cost.
