A soldier made a complaint of racial discrimination, which was referred to the Army Board. His request for an oral hearing was rejected by the Board.

**Held:** The Court of Appeal quashed the Board's decision, because it found (on illegality grounds) that the Board had fettered its discretion by having an inflexible policy never to hold oral hearings. On the more specific oral hearing point, Taylor LJ said that such hearings were not necessary in all cases of this nature, and he set out a number of useful criteria to consider, when deciding if oral hearings are required to meet the requisite standard of fairness, namely:

- The subject matter and circumstances of the particular case
- The nature of the decision to be made
- Whether there are substantive and complex issues of fact that cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the available written evidence.

Where an Army Board hears a complaint of racial discrimination, it must meet to consider the evidence, disclose the evidence to the complainant and listen to the complainant's response, in order to reach a fair decision. The applicant was black and complained to his commanding officer that he had suffered racial abuse from other soldiers. The commanding officer arranged for his complaint to be investigated by the Special Investigation Branch of Military Police. The applicant was given a summary report, and thereafter made a formal complaint of racial discrimination. By the [Race Relations Act 1976 s.75(8) and s.75(9)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8864BDA0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5d7182c2f97c44cd8f02502e1d6771a5&contextData=(sc.Search)) the complaint was heard by the commanding officer under the provisions of the [Army Act 1955 s.181](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6D595440E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5d7182c2f97c44cd8f02502e1d6771a5&contextData=(sc.Search)). The commanding officer rejected the complaint. Subsequent referrals to brigade and district levels were also rejected. The applicant sought redress from the Army Board, which comprised two members, each considering the papers and making his own enquiries separately, before reaching the decision to reject the complaint. A applied for judicial review.

Held, granting the application and quashing the Army Board's decision, that 

(1) although the applicant's complaint of unlawful discrimination was being heard under s.181 of the 1955 Act, the Army Board had to give effect to the substantive provisions of the 1976 Act and, therefore, the board was under a duty to make a specific finding whether there had been unlawful discrimination and to consider compensation or the form of redress for the applicant on his complaint being proved; 

(2) the board, in controlling its own procedure, had to act fairly and it was essential for a fair decision that the two members of the court met together to consider the evidence and contentions before coming to the decision; 

(3) all material before the board other than that subject to public policy immunity should be disclosed to the applicant and the applicant given an opportunity to respond before the board came to a decision.
