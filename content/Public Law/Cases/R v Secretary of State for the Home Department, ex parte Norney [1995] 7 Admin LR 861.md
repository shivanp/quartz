The case concerned the refusal to refer the cases of five IRA prisoners serving discretionary life sentences to the Parole Board until their tariff had expired. It was held to be unlawful because it would have meant them serving many months longer in detention than if referrals were made in advance. To follow such a policy, without compelling reasons, was held to be 'Wednesbury unreasonable' on the basis that it was oppressive and was contrary to the principles of common law, as well as article 5(4) of the European Convention on Human Rights.
