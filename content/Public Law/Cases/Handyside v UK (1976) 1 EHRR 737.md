In upholding a domestic court forfeiture order, the European Convention on Human Rights held that there was no discrimination against an applicant publisher in the enjoyment of his freedom of expression and property rights. Also, there was no persecution on the basis of political leanings, there was not an extreme degree of tolerance to other pornographic publications aimed at children or adolescents and the measures taken against the applicant had not varied widely from similar domestic cases. Accordingly, there had not been a violation of art 14 of the Convention. The seizure of the applicant's possessions was a provisional measure and was not a deprivation of his property, but rather the controlled use of his property.
