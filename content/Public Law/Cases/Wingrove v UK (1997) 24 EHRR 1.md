W was refused a certificate allowing the sale, hire or supply to the public of his film, Visions of ecstasy, by the British Board of Film Classification. The film portrayed the life of a 16th century Carmelite nun, and contained scenes of an erotic nature which the BBFC claimed would cause offence and shock, to the extent that the film would be found to be blasphemous under the criminal law. W's appeal to the Video Appeals Committee failed and he applied to the ECHR, contending that refusal of the certificate infringed his right to freedom of expression under the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 Art.10](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAE7756732A7B4BBC93274BDE4496FB0F/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=cff80dc8c0fc470888c277108de39dac&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, rejecting the application by seven votes to two, that the question was whether the undoubted interference with W's right to freedom of expression could be justified under Art.10(2). The interference was prescribed by law, as W, with sound legal advice, could have foreseen that the film would be considered blasphemous under the criminal law and the law did provide adequate protection against arbitrary interference with individual rights. The aim of the blasphemy laws was a legitimate one, being in accordance with Art.9, which provided for freedom of religion, thought and conscience, even though it only protected the religious feelings of Christians and not those of other faiths. Blasphemy laws could be considered necessary in a democratic society even though their use was now rare in Europe. States had a wider margin of appreciation in making restrictions against items concerning matters of religion, morals or personal beliefs than in those concerning politics or the public interest, and national authorities, rather than the court, were the right forum to decide what protection was necessary.
