Lord Goff took the view that Hoffmann was disqualified simply because he was closely connected with a party to the proceedings. Lord Browne-Wilkinsonâ€™s approach was slightly different. He held that Hoffmann was disqualified because his decision would lead to the promotion of a cause in which he was involved together with one of the parties. Note that there was no contention that Lord Hoffmann had actually demonstrated bias.

### Summary

In order to ensure the absolute impartiality of the judiciary it was necessary as a matter of law that a judge who was involved, whether personally or as a director of a company closely aligned to an organisation which was a party to the suit, be automatically disqualified from sitting.

### Abstract

Following the House of Lords' decision that PU, as former head of state of Chile, did not have immunity from arrest and extradition, PU discovered that one of the judges who heard the appeal, H, had been an unpaid director and chairman of Amnesty International Charity Ltd (AIC) since 1990. AIC was wholly controlled by Amnesty International (AI), which had been allowed to intervene in the appeal, and PU sought to have the decision set aside on the ground that H's connection with AI was such as to give the appearance that he might have been biased against PU.

### Held

Application granted.

The fundamental principle was that a person could not be a judge in his own cause. Although AI had effectively become a party to the appeal, H could not be treated as its alter ego and automatically disqualified on the ground that he was personally a party to the appeal. The question was whether a non pecuniary interest in non financial litigation was sufficient automatically to disqualify a person from sitting as a judge in the cause. One of AIC's objects was "to procure the abolition of torture, extra judicial execution and disappearance", and it was clear that AIC had an interest in the proceedings, which was to establish that PU was not entitled to immunity. The fact that H was not a member of AI but a director of its wholly owned company, which carried on much of its work, was irrelevant if the absolute impartiality of the judiciary was to be maintained. The fundamental principle that justice should not only be done but be seen to be done had to be applied to a judge involved, either personally or as a company director, in promoting the same causes in the same organisation as a party to the action. Directed that the CPS's appeal against the Divisional Court's decision be reheard by a differently constituted committee.
