#### Facts

The defendant had lived in a stable and permanent gay relationship with the protected tenant of a flat; the claimant was the freehold owner. In possession proceedings brought by the claimant on the tenant’s death, the judge found that the protected tenancy could not transfer to the defendant upon his partner’s death because such succession was only available to spouses as per Sch 1 para 2 Rent Act 1977.

#### Decision

Endorsing the approach of the court in R v A, the House of Lords used s. 3 of the HRA 1998 to read in the additional words 'as his husband and wife' into s. 76(1) of the Rent Act 1977 in order to make it compatible with articles 8 and 14, ECHR. The law lords held that the courts should take a broad approach to interpretation under s. 3. What mattered in their view was the substance of the legislative provision being interpreted, rather than the particular phraseology or form of words that were used.

### Summary

It was possible under the Human Rights Act 1998 s.3 to interpret the Rent Act 1977 Sch.1 para.2 so that it was compliant with the rights set out in the Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I. The court was required to depart from the interpretation of para.2 enunciated in Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd [2001] 1 A.C. 27, and para.2 should be read, and given effect to, as though the survivor of a homosexual couple living together was the surviving spouse of the original tenant.

### Abstract

The instant appeal against a decision of the Court of Appeal ([2002] EWCA Civ 1533, [2003] Ch. 380) was concerned with the survivorship rights of cohabiting same-sex couples in respect of statutory tenancies. The focus of the appeal was the interpretation of the [Rent Act 1977 Sch.1 para.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9A1F9EC0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5f359efe70414b439c52fecc96f2b222&contextData=(sc.Default)). Paragraph 2 provided for the succession rights of surviving spouses and those who lived together as husband and wife. According to _[Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd [2001] 1 A.C. 27, [1999] 10 WLUK 902](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA78D8C60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5f359efe70414b439c52fecc96f2b222&contextData=(sc.Default))_ this did not apply to cohabiting same-sex couples. The issue for determination was how para.2 should be interpreted in the light of the [Human Rights Act 1998](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FB840F0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5f359efe70414b439c52fecc96f2b222&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, dismissing the appeal (Lord Millett dissenting), that para.2 violated Sch.1 Part I Art.14 of the 1998 Act taken together with Art.8. There was no justification for the difference in treatment of heterosexual and same-sex couples. Pursuant to the power contained in s.3(1) of the 1998 Act, para.2 of the 1977 Act was to be interpreted to comply with the 1998 Act. Therefore, the difference in treatment was eliminated. Such an interpretation was consistent with para.2's underlying social policy of providing security of tenure, Fitzpatrick considered.

The couple were in a same-sex relationship. They are cohabiting (but this was before same-sex marriage legalised). One of them is a tenant, and the tenant dies. The landlord wants to evict the surviving partner. 

s 76 Housing Act 1988 had amended Sch 1 para 2, which had extended the right to co-habiting couples (from surviving spouses). s 76: spouse would include someone living together with the tenant as their wife or husband. 

HoL in [[fFtzpatrick v Sterling]] held that this only included heterosexual couples. There was a case from Portugal saying that this discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. 

So know that there was a violation of rights here. Just need to answer whether the section can be interpreted. 

Judges on s 3:
- Endorsed approach in [[R v A (Complainant's Sexual History) [2001] UKHL 25]]
	- Note Lord Steyn one of the judges in this case too
- Need to consider not just the words but the substance of the provision. 
- What you can't do: 
	- interpret in a way which goes against the grain/ fundamental features/ cardinal principles
	- contradict provisions
	- repeal or delete language (!!!)
	- can't change the substance completely
	- make decisions not qualified to make (the [[Bellinger v Bellinger [2003] UKHL 21]] scenario)
		- note this is not a new idea (super-Wednesbury, royal prerogative non-judiciable matters)

#### Decision
Yes, it was possible to interpret. Allowing same-sex cohabiting couples is consistent with the whole provision of the Housing Act. 

Read in the words 'if they were'. So before 'as their wife or husband' becomes 'as if they were wife or husband'.

Millett disagreed that this would not go against the fundamental feature of legislation. For him, the fundamental feature was heterosexuality. The majority treat it as a no-brainer. 

Millett says 'you can do great violence to the language'. He does agree with the general framework though. He takes into account the civil partnership bill going through Parliament.

The court used s 3 HRA to interpret Rent Act 1977 Sch 1 para 2 in a ECHR compliant way, reading a reference to ‘the surviving spouse’ as including homosexual couples (‘the surviving civil partner’) so as not to violate Art 8. It was found that there was no justification for the difference in treatment of heterosexual and same-sex couples.

Lord Millett dissented that it was possible to read paragraph 2(2) as extending to same-sex partners, and instead said he thought the court should make a s 4 DOI instead. He saw the question as one of constitutional importance and Parliamentary supremacy, and thought that judicial activisim, however well-meaning, should not upset or subvert this balance.

He thought that s 3 could be ‘dangerously seductive’, because there was a ‘temptation to apply the section beyond its proper scope and trespass upon the prerogative of Parliament in what will almost invariably be a good cause’.

Millett pointed out that:
- The exercise which the court is called on is one of interpretation, not legislation
- S 3 imposes an obligation to read legislation ‘so far as it is possible to do so’
- It does not mean it is necessary to identify an ambiguity or absurdity in the statute before giving it an abnormal meaning.

“It means only that the court must take the language of the statute as it finds it and give it a meaning which, however unnatural or unreasonable, is intellectually defensible. It can read in and read down; it can supply missing words, so long as they are consistent with the fundamental features of the legislative scheme; it can do considerable violence to the language and stretch it almost (but not quite) to breaking point. The court must "strive to find a possible interpretation compatible with Convention rights" (emphasis added): [_R v A [2002] 1 AC 45_](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2E996300E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2f2847133b854b588a6c492fb72fb2c7&contextData=(sc.Default)) , 67, *586 para 44, per Lord Steyn. But it is not entitled to give it an impossible one, however much it would wish to do so.”

“Again, "red, blue or green" cannot be read as meaning "red, blue, green or yellow"; the specification of three only of the four primary colours indicates a deliberate omission of the fourth (unless, of course, this can be shown to be an error). Section 3 cannot be used to supply the missing colour, for this would be not to interpret the statutory language but to contradict it.” — these aren’t primary colours!
