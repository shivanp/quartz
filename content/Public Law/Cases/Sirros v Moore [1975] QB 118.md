## Case Digest

Where a judge acting in his capacity as such does an act which is in fact outside his jurisdiction under the mistaken belief that he is entitled so to act, he will be immune from any proceedings taken against him in respect of that act. 

A circuit judge, having refused an appeal from a magistrates' court order for deportation for apparent lack of jurisdiction, ordered the appellant, then on bail, to be detained. Habeas corpus was granted on the ground that being mistaken as to his jurisdiction the judge had not followed the appropriate procedure and the detention was invalid on an action by the appellant against the judge and the arresting police officers for assault and false imprisonment: held, 
(1) that although the judge in fact had jurisdiction he mistakenly thought he had not; the wrong procedure had been followed and the detention was invalid; 
(2) that the judge, and the police officers acting on his instruction, was immune from liability because the acts complained of were done by him acting in his capacity as a judge, acting in good faith, albeit mistakenly.
