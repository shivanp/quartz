The case was prompted by a decision by the then Minister (and Prime Minister), Margaret Thatcher, to ban trade union membership at the government's listening base in Cheltenham.

Her authority to do this came from the PM's prerogative power to regulate the working terms and conditions of the Civil Service.

The issue therefore was not whether the PM had the authority to do this — that was not disputed by the CCSU. Instead, it was the manner in which she had used her prerogative power. The allegation was that she had done so in an unfair way.

The unions claimed successfully that they had a **legitimate expectation** ('LE') of being consulted before any notable changes were made in working conditions, since they had consistently been consulted in such situations over the previous four decades. They were claiming that the PM had acted unfairly by frustrating their LE by announcing the ban on union membership without any prior consultation.

**The government's defence**

The first and most fundamental line of argument in defence was that the courts were simply not permitted to review how the PM used her prerogative powers. If it was accepted (as it was) that the PM had the power in question, judicial review should go no further.

This was the key issue of principle in the case, and the House of Lords' ruling against the PM on this point set the tone for a notable development of the law in this area.

The essence of the law lords' ruling was that it made no constitutional sense for prerogative powers to be seen as having a special status just because of their historic origins and association with the Crown. Both prerogative powers and statutory powers were forms of executive power; the latter had for many decades been reviewable.

**Source of power no longer relevant**

Therefore, the traditional distinction between power given by Parliament and that bequeathed by the prerogative should no longer determine if government actions were reviewable or not.

Put another way, the government could no longer shelter behind the fact that a power came from the prerogative — in principle all executive powers should be reviewable in order that the rule of law be promoted effectively.

> “[there is no] logical reason why the fact that the source of power is the prerogative and not statute should today deprive the citizen of that right of challenge to the manner of its exercise… In either case, the act in question is the act of the executive. To talk of that act as the act of the sovereign savours of the archaism of past centuries.” per Lord Roskill.

**PM's second line of defence**

Though the PM lost on the key issue of principle, she did manage ultimately to defend the case.

The law lords accepted that the unions had a LE of being consulted and acknowledged that this had been 'frustrated' by the PM. However, they did not find this ultimately to be unlawful as they accepted the PM's argument that there was a justifiable public interest factor in not consulting, as advance notice may have triggered strike action and that may have jeopardised the country's national security, (given the highly sensitive work carried on at GCHQ).

In other words the court had reviewed how the PM used her prerogative power, but they ultimately considered this has not been done unlawfully. The final, technical outcome of the case was that the PM was ultimately able to defend her frustration of the legitimate expectation by persuading the court that it had been necessary for national security reasons to have carried out the policy without prior consultation.

### Abstract

The court will not intervene to review the decision of a minister where the requirements of national security outweigh other matters. Since 1947 staff employed at GCHQ had been permitted to be members of trade unions. In December 1983 the Minister, with no prior consultation, peremptorily altered the conditions of service, forbidding membership of a union. The applicants sought judicial review on the ground of unfairness due to failure to consult. Glidewell, J. granted the application and declared the instruction to be invalid. The Court of Appeal allowed the Minister's appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal that 
(1) executive action based on common law or the use of a prerogative power was not therefore immune from review; but 
(2) the requirements of national security outweighed those of fairness, which was a matter for the executive to weigh and decide. (_[R. v Criminal Injuries Compensation Board Ex p.
