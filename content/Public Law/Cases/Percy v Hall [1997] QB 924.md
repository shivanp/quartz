**Facts:** The Court of Appeal was asked to consider the argument that certain military bye-laws were too uncertain in their geographical scope. Protesters, who tried to enter a military base, were arrested and sought to argue that the boundaries of the bases were not defined clearly enough in the bye-laws, so members of the public could not know with certainty where they could or could not go.

**Held:** The possibility of such a challenge was accepted by the court, but ultimately rejected the challenge on the facts.
