The Court of Justice held that:
1) The principle applies in all national courts. This includes the constitutional courts of the Member States.
2) The principle applies irrespective of when the national law was enacted.
3) The Italian court which made the preliminary reference was not entitled to wait until the Italian constitutional court had ruled that the national law was to be disapplied. The Court of Justice insisted that EEC law must immediately be given precedence over the national law.

Note the effect of the supremacy of EU law here. The national law is not to be rendered void or invalid. It simply has to be disapplied. In other words, it is not to be enforced if it is incompatible with EU law.
