FACTS: The appellants had wished to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. They had planned a non-violent action to immobilise an aircraft at an RAF station for a period of six hours. They were convicted of conspiracy to commit a breach of the **Official Secrets Act 1911, s 1**, namely to enter a prohibited place for 'a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state’.

HELD: On appeal against conviction, Radcliffe LJ agreed with the trial judge's direction to the jury that the appellants had made their entry for two separate purposes:

> '… an immediate purpose of obstructing the airfield, and a further or long-term purpose of inducing or compelling the government to abandon nuclear weapons in the true interests of the state.'

Chandler v Director of Public Prosecutions (1964) AC 763 is an Administrative Law case regarding Official Secrets Act offence. 

**Facts:**

The applicants conspired to enter the airfield which was a ‘prohibited place’ pursuant to [Official Secrets Act 1911 s.1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/28/section/1). They admitted to the entering, however, maintained that their objective has never been to cause a disruption, instead their ultimate interest was to benefit the state. 

**Issues:**

In Chandler v DPP, the trial judge did not allow the evidence and cross-examination. Consequently, the defendants contended this was a wrongful approach.

**Held:**

The House of Lords dismissed an appeal by the defendants. In Chandler v DPP, the House held that when a person enters a prohibited place and impedes its functioning, he is guilty of the felony under [Act 1911 s.1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/28/section/1) and his interests at heart are irrelevant. Further, the person who commits such an offence cannot be heard to say or can not show the evidence that his interests were not prejudicial to the state. Therefore, the approach that the trial judge adopted was the right one.

### Summary

1. The mischief aimed at by the [Official Secrets Act 1911 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I30182D40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aef537d5b6f544f098770a95bd5d64b0&contextData=(sc.Default)), is not limited to espionage but includes sabotage. The side-note mentioning “spying” only cannot be considered in construing the Act. 
2. If a person enters a prohibited place in order to cause obstruction and interference which is prejudicial to the defence dispositions of the state, an offence is committed under the section and his ultimate objects are irrelevant. 
3. (Lord Devlin dissenting) The accused cannot be heard to say, or lead evidence to show, that his ultimate purpose was not prejudicial to the state, if he has obstructed or interfered with a prohibited place obstruction of or interference with which a Secretary of State had declared under [Official Secrets Act 1911 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I301917A0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aef537d5b6f544f098770a95bd5d64b0&contextData=(sc.Default)) would be useful to the enemy.

### Abstract

The appellants were convicted of conspiring to commit an offence against the [Official Secrets Act 1911 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I30182D40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aef537d5b6f544f098770a95bd5d64b0&contextData=(sc.Default)) in entering an airfield which was a “prohibited place.” They admitted that they conspired to enter the airfield and impede its functioning, but contended that they had not the necessary intention, as their ultimate object was to benefit the state. The trial judge refused to allow evidence to be called on this point or cross-examination on it, and the appellants appealed on the ground that this course should not have been taken.

Held, that the appeal should be dismissed. _[China Navigation Co Ltd v Attorney General [1932] 2 K.B. 197, [1932] 4 WLUK 11](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I86C38930E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aef537d5b6f544f098770a95bd5d64b0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Zamora, The (No.1) [1916] 2 A.C. 77, [1916] 4 WLUK 14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I120991A0E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aef537d5b6f544f098770a95bd5d64b0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
