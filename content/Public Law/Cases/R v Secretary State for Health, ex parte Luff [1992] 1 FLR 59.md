**Facts:** A middle-aged couple wanted to adopt Romanian orphans but were refused. The Health Secretary had considered on the one hand, advice that suggested Mr Luff's long-term health and life expectancy was not good. He had also taken account of, but not followed, the advice of the Bexley Health Panel, which had found the couple suitable to adopt.

**Held:** Waite J found that the decision was not irrational because the opposing viewpoint, which took into account the likely trauma that would have been caused to the children, if the couple were to suffer from ill health or death, was one that could be reasonably held.

It was not unreasonable for the Health Secretary to advise the Secretary of State for the Home Department, for the purposes of considering whether to exercise his extra-statutory concessionary powers to grant entry clearance to two very young Romanian orphans, that the prospective adoptive father was not suitable for the purpose of adoption because his life expectancy was thought to be about 10 years. 

L and his wife were aged 53 and 37 respectively. In 1988 L underwent a coronary by-pass operation. Medical experts put his future life expectation at about 10 years. In May 1990 L and his wife visited two orphanages in Romania, where they met two very young children of about two years of age living in appalling conditions. They decided to adopt the children. In order to obtain entry clearance for the children, it was necessary for an entry clearance officer to make enquiries of their circumstances in Romania and then to refer their applications to the Home Office. Whether the children would be admitted would depend on the exercise by the Secretary of State for the Home Department of his extra-statutory powers of concession.

The Secretary of State for the Home Department is required to consider whether to exercise those powers, having sought advice on the welfare aspects of the case and the likelihood that a court in this country would approve the making of an adoption order from the Health Department. He is not obliged to accept that advice. There are no arrangements for recognising an adoption order made in Romania. The requirements of the [Adoption Act 1976](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6043B810E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=693e9719dfbf46abb2070e1e1cace1e1&contextData=(sc.Search)) have to be satisfied, including s.6, which requires, inter alia, that “first consideration must be given to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child throughout his childhood”. Acting on the advice of the medical experts, the Department of Health advised the Secretary of State for the Home Department that L was not a suitable person to apply to adopt the children. The Secretary of State for the Home Department accordingly refused to authorise their admission. 

Applying for judicial review of the advice tendered by the Department of Health, L argued that 

(1) the Department of Health had proceeded on an erroneous assumption of fact that other adopters might be found; 

(2) the Health Secretary had given too much importance to the question of L's life expectancy; 

(3) he had ignored the advice of the Bexley adoption panel who had made a recommendation in favour of L, having seen the medical opinion; 

(4) he had ignored the authorities in which childhood security did not arise at all, for instance grandparent adoption cases; and

(5) his decision was irrational given the appalling circumstances of the children in Romania.

Held, dismissing the application, that 

(1) the Department of Health was entitled to conclude that further adopters might come forward, some 160 applications having been made within the previous 12 months; 

(2) L's life expectancy was one matter considered by the Health Secretary, but there were other issues considered by him in a balancing act with which the court would not interfere (_[ELS Wholesale (Wolverhampton) Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment (1988) 56 P. & C.R. 69, [1987] 5 WLUK 85](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA134A3D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=693e9719dfbf46abb2070e1e1cace1e1&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied); 

(3) he gave the Bexley adoption panel's recommendation such advice as he thought fit, made as it was on limited material;

(4) the grandparent adoption cases and similar authorities were an element of the balancing exercise of factors taken into account by the Health Secretary with which the court would not interfere; 

(5) L was unable to demonstrate that the Health Secretary's advice was irrational in the sense described by the authority of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p. Brind; 

(6) the Health Secretary's decision was clearly rational since it would be highly disruptive to the children, whose most pressing need was stability, if L were to die during their teenage years (_[R. v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p. Brind [1990] 2 W.L.R. 787, [1989] 12 WLUK 70](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I657370A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=693e9719dfbf46abb2070e1e1cace1e1&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered).*
