### Summary

Discrimination between men and women in the payment of widow's pension was objectively justified and although discrimination in the payment of widow's payment and widowed mother's allowance infringed the Convention rights of widowers, it was not unlawful under the Human Rights Act 1998 s.6(1) because the application of that subsection was excluded by s.6(2) of the 1998 Act.

### Abstract

The appellant secretary of state appealed against the decision ([2003] EWCA Civ 813, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 2623) in relation to claims by the respondent widowers (W) to social security and pension payments to which they would have been entitled had they been widows, and W cross appealed. W had claimed that after the death of their wives the non payment to them of amounts equivalent to widow's payment under the [Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 s.36](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9E7E5310E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=321e6e43317b41cb92b0172afe64f9f9&contextData=(sc.Default)), widowed mother's allowance under s.37 of that Act and widow's pension under s.38, was contrary to their rights under the [Human Rights Act 1998 Sch.1 Part I Art.14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B36F6F0E45011DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=321e6e43317b41cb92b0172afe64f9f9&contextData=(sc.Default)) read with Sch.1 Part II Art.1 and Sch.1 Part I Art.8. The [Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FB581D1E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=321e6e43317b41cb92b0172afe64f9f9&contextData=(sc.Default)) abolished widow's benefits for widows whose husbands died on or after April 9, 2001. W brought proceedings on the basis that after the coming into force of the 1998 Act the secretary of state had acted incompatibly with their Convention rights and therefore contrary to s.6(1) of the 1998 Act in denying them the benefits that a widow would have received, and that they were victims of the secretary of state's unlawful acts or omissions and therefore entitled to bring proceedings under s.7(1)(a) of the 1998 Act. The secretary of state submitted that (1) discrimination between men and women in the payment of widow's pension was objectively justified; (2) although discrimination in the payment of widow's payment and widowed mother's allowance infringed the Convention rights of widowers, it was not unlawful under s.6(1) because the application of that subsection was excluded by s.6(2) of the 1998 Act.

Held, allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross appeal, that 

(1) the preservation of widow's pension for widows bereaved before April 9, 2001 was objectively justified on grounds that older widows as a class were likely to be needier than older widowers as a class or younger widows as a class, and involved no breach of Convention rights. 

(2) The secretary of state was entitled to rely on the s.6(2) defence, either under s.6(2)(b), on the basis that in deciding not to make matching payments the secretary of state "was acting so as to give effect to" s.36 and s.37 of the 1992 Act, which mandated payment of the benefits to widows only, or under s.6(2)(a), on the basis that, "as a result of" s.36 and s.37, the secretary of state "could not have acted differently" because he had to pay the widows and could not lawfully have made matching payments to widowers. 

(3) (Obiter) W would have been victims for the purposes of bringing an action under s.7(1)(a) because they had done enough in the circumstances to demonstrate that they would have made a claim for the relevant benefits if that had been possible. 

(4) (Obiter) If the secretary of state had not been protected by s.6(2), he would not have been able to resist liability on the grounds that a period for changing the law ought to have been taken into account, Walden v Liechtenstein (Admissibility) (33916/96) (Unreported, March 16, 2000) considered. 

(5) (Obiter) The government's refusal to make extra statutory payments to W in the same way as it had to widowers who had petitioned the European Court of Human Rights before the 1998 Act came into force was not itself discrimination contrary to Art.14
