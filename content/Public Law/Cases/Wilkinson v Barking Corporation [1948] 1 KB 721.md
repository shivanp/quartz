S. 35 of the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1937, provides: 
> "Any question concerning the rights or liabilities of an employee of a local authority . . . under any of the provisions of Part I . . . of this Act . . . shall be decided in the first instance by the authority concerned, and if the employee is dissatisfied with any such decision . . . shall be determined by the Minister, and the Minister's determination shall be final . . .". 

The questions which are left to the decision of the local authority and of the Minister under the provisions of Part I of the Act to the exclusion of the Supreme Court include the question whether a contributory employee of the authority "has completed ten years' service and is incapable of discharging efficiently the duties of his employment by reason of permanent ill-health or infirmity of mind or body" and is, therefore, entitled to a superannuation allowance under the provisions of s.8(1) of the Act, and also the question whether such an employee has forfeited all right to an annual superannuation allowance under s.24 of the Act "in consequence of an offence of a fraudulent character or of grave misconduct". The expression "employee" in s.35 of the Act includes a person who, e.g., by reason of resignation under s.8 or by reason of dismissal under s.24, is an ex-employee at the time when the question concerning his rights is determined.
