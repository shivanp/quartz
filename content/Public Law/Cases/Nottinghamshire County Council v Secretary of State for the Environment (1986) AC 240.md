Whilst the Secretary of State must adhere to one set of principles in giving guidance to local authorities over spending, the principles themselves may lawfully reflect the differences between local authorities, for example as to their past spending patterns. Where the Secretary of State exercises his powers in such circumstances the court should not interfere merely on the ground of "unreasonableness." The Secretary of State gave guidance to local authorities over their spending which the respondent authorities felt unfairly discriminated against them as being over-spending councils. They contended that the differentiation between high-spending and low-spending authorities was unlawful.

Held, that the guidance given by the Secretary of State was lawful and proper. The Secretary of State was obliged to adhere to consistent principles, but those principles themselves could properly contain matters differentiating between high-spending and low-spending authorities. Only if there was an allegation of bad faith, or something akin thereto, could the court properly intervene on a ground of "unreasonableness," particularly where the matter was one for the political judgment of the Secretary of State.

Lord Scarman: would only get involved if decision made:
- in bad faith
- in ill motive
- Minister had taken leave of his senses.
