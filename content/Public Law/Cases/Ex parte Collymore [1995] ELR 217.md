**Facts:** A policy on student grants, although worded flexibly, had never in fact resulted in an award (despite 300 appeals against refusal).

**Held:** There had been an unlawful fettering of discretion because the local authority had applied the policy inflexibly at the expense of being open to consider individual applications.

The councilâ€™s policy of not awarding discretionary education grants except in exceptional circumstances, had been applied too rigidly. In some 100 appeals over a period of about 3 years, no review had been successful and no discretionary awards had been made. In those circumstances it was difficult to determine exactly what exceptional circumstances, according to the council, would have justified an award.
