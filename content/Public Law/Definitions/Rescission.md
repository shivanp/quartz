Setting aside of a contract. 

Available when contract a result of:
- Misrepresentation
- Mistake
- Duress/ undue influence

Only available when parties can be put back into pre-contractual positions (stuff hasn't been done yet).

The remedy of rescission may be lost where the contract is affirmed, as the affirmation will operate as a bar to rescission. The court might conclude that a contract is affirmed if, after the duress has ceased, the innocent party fails to challenge in a timely way the contract and/or acts in compliance with its terms.
