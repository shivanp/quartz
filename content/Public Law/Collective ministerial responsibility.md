## Collective ministerial responsibility

Doctrine or convention of collective ministerial responsibility (CMR). From Jeffery Marshall 1989. 

For a government with a reliable Commons majority, parliamentary sovereignty is in effect Cabinet sovereignty. So behaviour in the Cabinet is important.

Loveland: 
>The convention of ministerial responsibility is perhaps the most important non-legal rule within our constitution. 

Components are:

#### Confidentiality

Duty on ministers not to disclose confidential matters. Quite a broad rule: all Ministers owe their Cabinet colleagues a duty of confidentiality not to reveal how colleagues argued/ voted in particular disputes. Doing so would undermine unanimity rule and stop Ministers speaking their mind. This rule is broadly respected in the formal sense. 

But loads of press leaks suggests that in practice many Ministers ignore. And once Minister leaves the Cabinet, how long should they have to keep quiet for? How stringently? In [[Attorney-General v Jonathan Cape [1976] QB 752]], significance of convention. Legal cause of action of breach of confidence could potentially extend to cabinet information. Also, practice of unattributable briefing discussed. 

#### Unanimity
- Once a decision reached, all ministers should publicly agree with Govt. If not able to do this, should resign
- If they lose argument, obliged to sign up to majority view of united front
- The rule also supposes that ministerial differences of opinion have been aired in Cabinet, demanding collective loyalty to collective decisions. 
- Originally arose to protect Ministers from the King's attempt to undermine their power by exposing public arguments.
- The current rationale is to maintain public and business confidence in the unity and purpose of government

##### Examples
- Heseltine resigned as Defence Secretary over Westland Affair in 1986. By his own account, this was because the Cabinet did not accept that a Minister may argue their case fully before their colleagues. A Cabinet meeting scheduled for him to make his argument had been cancelled by Thatcher. 
- 2003: Robin Cook and Clare Short resigned from Tony Blair's Cabinet over intervention in Iraq
- 2018: BoJo, Dominic Raab and David Davis resigned over direction of Brexit
- 1931: Labour Government proposed large cuts in public expenditure due to Great Depression, which were opposed by 8 Cabinet Ministers. The PM tendered resignation to the King, who then brokered a coalition government. 
- 1966-70 Labour Cabinet deeply divided over lowering voting age to 18, such disagreement not made public until some years later. So the government could present the legislation as enjoying unanimous Cabinet support. 

##### Suspending collective solidarity
Employed by both Labour and Conservative Cabinets over government policies towards the European Community: both sides allowed to campaign freely by Harold Wilson in 1975 (whether Britain should remain in the EEC). 

Callaghan permitted Cabinet to openly old differing views in 1979 about the type of electoral system to use for EEC Parliament, said collective responsibility would always apply “except in cases where I announce that it does not”. 

##### Allowing dissent

The combination of personal ambition and policy preference seems to allow for dissent, when it matches party political ambitions:
- 1883 Cabinet tolerance of Chamberlain's independent line, portraying his dissent as an example of 'ministerial freedom of speech', though this is clearly incompatible with unanimity. Real reason: his dismissal or resignation was politically suicidal.
- James Callaghan's dissent as Home Secretary from industrial relations policies of the second Wilson administration: publicly opposing legal sanctions for workers who took industrial action without trade union approval. Upcoming General Election: so no action because government needed trade unions on side. 

##### Party specific?

Ellis argued Labour governments contained a wider rather of opinion than Conservative administrations (pre 80s) and were less likely to compromise ideology for compromise, so party factions could hold the government hostage and felt no need to quieten down. 

#### Confidence
- Govt needs to ensure it has confidence of Parliament
- The rule originally required the government to resign if it could not command majority Commons support, and initially applied if a government was defeated on a major policy issue. Difficult to define 'major' issues. But 1974-79 Labour Party refused to resign after policy defeats. 
- Modern form: the government is only required to resign if defeated on an explicit no-confidence motion. A vote of no confidence can be tabled by the leader of the opposition. Strong conventional pressure on PM to resign and bring about general election. 
- Prosaically, provides an indirect means for the people to signify withdrawal of their consent to a particular government. 
- Slightly more involved since Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. 


#### Cabinet vs PM power

Traditionally the PM is the 'first among equals' rather than meaning to dominate the Cabinet. Walter Bagehot suggested that the Cabinet was becoming a 'dignified' rather than 'efficient' part of the constitution, meaning the role was becoming increasingly ceremonial and symbolic. 

Prime Ministers achieved this through three powers:
1. Being able to appoint and dismiss Ministers
2. Setting the agenda for Cabinet discussion (allowing them to avoid challenges over issues by leaving them off the agenda)
3. By controlling the remit and membership of Cabinet committees. 

Crossman: by the 1960s, collective responsibility had assumed a new meaning: rather than meaning all Cabinet Ministers were involved in decision-making they were obliged to support, that all Ministers had to lend unquestioning support to decisions by Cabinet Committees/ “inner Cabinet” of senior Ministers/ PM. Heseltine found this trend to be an established and unacceptable feature of Thatcher Cabinets. 

Harold Wilson wrote in 1972 that “The Prime Minister's task is to get a consensus of Cabinet, or he cannot reasonably ask for loyalty and collective responsibility”. Enhancing government efficiency without overly concentrating power is tricky. 

Dismissive Prime Ministerial treatment of Cabinet colleagues common over the decades. Harold MacMillan sacked $\frac{1}{3}$ of his Cabinet in "night of the long knives” July 1962. But short term power: since the PM appointed these ministers in the first place, their removal casts doubt on their own competence. 

Thatcher portrayed as placing little faith in full Cabinet participation: said her government would “not waste time having internal arguments”. Then purged Cabinet after 1983 landslide election. But ultimately led to her downfall: Heseltine, Lawson, Howe resignations over Presidential style of government. 

Then John Major adopted a more collective style, but then again Tony Blair adopted a 'command and control' approach. Blair and Brown relinquished governmental control of the interest rate policy to the Bank of England before the first Blair Cabinet ever met.
