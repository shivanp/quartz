## Introduction

One of the hallmarks of a free society is protection of the rights of its citizens to go about their daily lives free from unwarranted state interference. This protection covers a variety of areas including the right to privacy and the right to speak one’s own mind, as embodied in articles 8 and 10 of the ECHR, respectively.

However, there are other rights contained in the ECHR which, if violated, can have an even more profound impact on an individual, for example: the right to life (article 2); the right not to be subject to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment (article 3); and the right not to be arbitrarily detained (article 5).

It will be recalled that these articles of the Convention, alongside the other protections in articles 1 to 12, and 14 of the ECHR, have been incorporated into UK domestic law by the HRA 1998. In enforcing rights, the courts also have a duty to take into account the decisions and jurisprudence of the ECtHR (s. 2(1), HRA).

## ECHR article 2

> [!statute] Article 2: right to life
> 
> (1) Everyone’s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.
> 
> (2) Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:
> - (a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence
> - (b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained
> - (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection

> [!note]
> As originally drafted, article 2 allowed for the death penalty. All signatory states to the Convention have, however, subsequently abolished this sanction.
#### Limits

Article 2 is one of the most fundamental rights in the Convention, and the contracting states are not permitted to derogate from it under article 15. The ECtHR has found that, along with article 3, it embodies one of the basic values of the contracting states and, as such, its provisions must be strictly construed. (These principles were established in cases such as [[Giulani and Gaggio v Italy]], and [[McCann and Others v UK]]).

Notwithstanding the fundamental nature of article 2, it is **not** an ‘absolute right’ in the way that article 3 is. You will have noted that the wording of article 2(2) specifically includes limits on the right to life, which allow the state to take life for what might loosely be termed exceptional ‘law enforcement purposes.’

However, if the state takes a life, for example because this was required to defend another person from unlawful violence, the state must demonstrate that its use of force was ‘no more than absolutely necessary.’ In other words, it must show that the degree of force used against person A was proportionate to achieve the legitimate aim of protecting person B.

#### Key case

[[McCann, Farrell and Savage v UK (1996) 21 EHRR 97]] is one of the leading Strasbourg cases on article 2. It provides guidance on the nature, scope and limits of the state’s obligations under article 2.

Article 2 has been interpreted as imposing a duty on the state to investigate all situations in which the state directly takes a life. The rationale for this lies in the fact that it is primarily the responsibility of states themselves to investigate and remedy human rights breaches. If the state carries out a proper investigation, then there will be no need to invoke the article in this respect.

In _McCann,_ the ECtHR stated:
> ‘The obligation to protect the right to life under this provision, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by, inter alios, agents of the state’.

[[Jordan v UK (2001) 37 EHRR 52]], [[McKerr v UK (2002) 34 EHRR 553]], [[Kelly & Others v UK, Judgment of 4 May 2001]], and [[Shanaghan v UK (2001) 11 BHRC 1]] are all cases in which the ECtHR found violations of article 2 on the ground that the inquests held into killings by security forces in Northern Ireland were flawed. (These cases were decided under both articles 2 and 6 - the right to a fair and effective legal process).

In [[Al-Skeini and Others v UK [2011] ECHR 55721 07]]the ECtHR found that the procedural, investigatory element of article 2 extended extra-territorially so that the UK was required to investigate the deaths of six Iraqi civilians killed in 2003 (in Iraq) in circumstances involving British soldiers. Jurisdiction applied under the HRA as UK military forces had sufficient control over the territory at the time these deaths occurred.

[[Armani Da Silva v UK (2016) 63 EHRR 12]] concerned the notorious killing in July 2005 of the Brazilian citizen, Jean Charles de Menezes, in Stockwell underground station. Ultimately, the Grand Chamber found that the decision not to prosecute individual officers was because of insufficient evidence as to criminal liability, rather than because the UK state had failed in its obligation to fully investigate all aspects of the fatal shooting.

#### Investigative duty: Third parties

In situations where a death has been caused by a third party, rather than by state agents, there will also be a duty to investigate. [[R (Amin) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] UKHL 51]] is an instructive case on these points.

#### Positive obligation under art 2

As previously noted, article 2 can also impose a positive obligation on the State to protect or preserve life.

In its most basic form, this positive obligation requires states to have criminal justice systems that punish and deter homicide. You will recall, from an earlier topic, the case of [[X and Y v The Netherlands [1985] 8 EHRR 235]], where the lack of a specific criminal sanction in Dutch law allowed a man to evade conviction for the sexual assault of a girl with learning difficulties. The respondent state was held to have breached its positive obligation under article 8.

However, it can also include an operational obligation on states to take preventative measures to protect individuals when their life is at risk from other individuals or from suicide.

This obligation is not as broad as it sounds, as liability will only attach to state authorities if they knew, or ought to have known, that there was a real and immediate risk to life but failed to take appropriate measures. You will recall that this was the test laid down by the ECtHR in [[Osman v UK (2000) 29 EHRR 245]].

#### Medical law cases

In [[NHS Trust A v M; NHS Trust B v H [2001] 1 All ER 801]], for instance, the Family Division of the High Court held that the withdrawal of treatment (through hydration and nutrition) to M, a patient in a persistent vegetative state, would not constitute a breach of article 2. The state was not considered to be under an obligation to prolong M's life in a situation where the prognosis was so poor.

It is also interesting to note the impact of this aspect of the article on the contentious issue of assisted suicide, most notably in the case of [[R (on application of Pretty) v DPP [2001] UKHL 61]], and the subsequent Strasbourg case, [[Pretty v UK (2002) 35 EHRR 1]]. In such cases, the courts have to apply a balance between the wishes of the person not to have to die in circumstances that may be ‘inhuman and degrading’ (in article 3 terms) and the state’s obligation to do what is reasonable to preserve life.

The degree to which doctors and NHS Trusts might be responsible under the positive duty under article 2 for ‘negligent’ treatment, leading to the death of a patient, was considered in the case of [[Rabone v Pennine Care NHS Trust [2012] UKSC 2]].

> [!summary]
> Article 2 protects the right to life:
> - Article 2 is limited by the specified circumstances in article 2(2)(a) to (c).
> - The use of lethal force must be ‘no more than absolutely necessary’ (art 2(2)).
> - Article 2 provides for negative ([[McCann, Farrell and Savage v UK (1996) 21 EHRR 97]]) and positive obligations ([[Osman v UK (2000) 29 EHRR 245]]) and, in either case, there is a secondary obligation to investigate deaths where the state is involved ([[McCann, Farrell and Savage v UK (1996) 21 EHRR 97]]; [[R (Amin) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] UKHL 51]])

## ECHR article 3

> [!statute] Article 3: prohibition of torture
> No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading
> treatment or punishment.
Article 3 of the ECHR is an absolute right in that it permits no derogation and is expressed unequivocally. Indeed, if there is one right which is recognised throughout the democratic world as an absolute right, it is the prohibition against torture.

It is clear that the article imposes both negative and positive duties on public authorities. As noted above, the negative duty that is imposed by the article is an absolute one: 'no one shall be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’.

The positive duty is, however, not absolute, and this is discussed and explained below.

#### Inhuman and degrading treatment

The wording of article 3 tells us nothing specific about what amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment and/or torture. It is important to note, though, that these are seen to apply to two distinct levels of ill-treatment and abuse.

Whilst it is difficult to define all of the circumstances that will engage article 3, it is clear that the standard of what constitutes ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ is set at a high level. Only serious ill-treatment or neglect falls within its scope, so this must attain a minimum level of severity. Assessment of that minimum is relative as it depends on all the circumstances of the case.

Relevant factors are the nature and context of the treatment, the manner of its execution, its duration, and its physical and mental effects, including, where relevant, its impact on the health of the person involved, both positive and negative – see [[R (B) v Responsible Medical Officer, Broadmoor Hospital [2005] EWHC 1936 Admin]].


#### Torture

‘Torture’, on the other hand, is an aggravated, deliberate and cruel form of treatment or punishment. The approach taken in [[Ireland v UK (1979-80) 2 EHRR 25]] confirms this basic distinction between 'torture' and 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’.

The ECtHR held that:
> 'It was the intention that the Convention with its distinction between torture and inhuman treatment should by the first of these terms attach a special stigma to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering.’

An attempt to reopen the case more recently in [[Ireland v UK (No. 2) [2018] ECHR 247]], on the basis that new evidence had come to light, was rejected by the ECtHR.

The principle from _Ireland v UK,_ that 'torture' should be regarded as qualitatively different, is uncontroversial. It arose from a desire to preserve the relative stigma of 'torture'. However, the exact dividing line between the two article 3 concepts that was adopted in the case has come in for considerable criticism.

#### Torture cases
A comparative but more violent case was [[Aksoy v Turkey (1997) 23 EHRR 553]] in which the applicant was stripped naked, strung up with his arms tied together behind his back and had electrodes attached to his genitals. Water was thrown over him and he was beaten at 2½ hour intervals for four days. The ECtHR considered that this form of deliberately inflicted treatment was of such a cruel nature that it amounted to torture.

Similarly, in [[Aydin v Turkey (1998) 25 EHRR 251]] the complainant was raped, beaten, stripped and sprayed with high pressure water, while in custody. The ECtHR found that this clearly amounted to torture. It said that, even if the rape had not occurred, there was a possibility that it would still have amounted to torture.

#### Inhuman and degrading treatment cases

The scope of the ‘lesser’ form of article 3 abuse is wider but this makes it more difficult to chart with precision. At the lower end of the spectrum, prison conditions have proved one area where attempts to raise an article 3 violation have been made in the domestic context.

See [[Napier v The Scottish Ministers [2005] 1 SC 307]] and [[R (Spinks) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 275]].

(See also Foster: 'Prison Conditions, Human Rights & Article 3 ECHR' [2005] Public Law Spring 35-44, and [[Peers v Greece (2001) 33 EHRR 51]]).

#### Positive obligation

In [[R (Q) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 364]] it was held that article 3 imposes a positive duty on public authorities to take action to prevent individuals being subjected to torture and/or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment at the hands of others.

Unlike the negative obligation, the article 3 positive obligation is not absolute. The Court of Appeal held in [[R (Bagdanavicius) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] 1 WLR 1207]] that:
> 'a claimant may … be able to establish an Article 3 claim if he can show that the authorities there know or ought to know of particular circumstances likely to expose him to risk of Article 3 ill-treatment’.

The approach that has begun to emerge therefore reflects the approach which has been taken in relation to article 2. 

The unusual case of [[Soering v UK (1989) 11 EHRR 439]] specifically concerned the Convention concept of the positive obligation: Soering successfully argued that being stuck on death row for many years would constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. 

While Soering concerned the obligations imposed on the UK authorities in relation to extradition, [[Chahal v UK (1997) 23 EHRR 413]] dealt with the application of the same obligations in relation to deportation. The case extended the principle in Soering to apply to situations where non-state actors represented the possible cause of the article 3 mistreatment.

The positive obligation on states under article 3 extends to cases where individuals claim that their removal from the territory would cause a significant deterioration in their physical or mental health due to not having access to the same standards of medication and healthcare in their home countries as they do in their host state.

Following the ECtHR’s decision in [[Paposhvili v Belgium [2017] Imm AR 867]], in [[AM (Zimbabwe) [2020] UKSC 17]], the Supreme Court confirmed that the UK’s obligation not to deport an applicant on medical grounds would apply where there were “substantial grounds for believing that the applicant, while not at imminent risk of dying, would face a real risk in the receiving country of being exposed either to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in health resulting in intense suffering, or to a significant reduction in life expectancy”.

In a different context, in [[Vinter and Others v UK [2016] ECRR 1]], the ECtHR found that ‘whole life orders’ which meant that the applicants could never be released from prison (other than on compassionate grounds at the discretion of the Home Secretary) amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment under article 3. It is interesting to note, however, that as a result of the [[Attorney-General's Reference (No 69 of 2013) [2014] EWCA Crim 188]], the Court of Appeal has held that the whole-life tariff regime is compatible with article 3. This hinges on a clear difference of opinion between the courts with regard to the clarity of the relevant provision enabling release in exceptional circumstances.

#### Investigative duty

In [[DSD and NBV v Commissioner of the Metropolis [2018] UKSC 11]] the Supreme Court found that there had been a breach of the police’s obligation to conduct an effective investigation into the crimes committed by the former taxi-driver, John Worboys.

This was seen as part of the failure to prevent the violation of the two claimants’ article 3 rights by Worboys. The court’s view was unanimous, but it was notable that some of the justices differed in their view on the nature of the obligation owed.

Lord Kerr, giving the main judgment, noted the difference in the positions in the law of tort, where a common law duty to investigate is not imposed on the police, and the law pertaining to the ECHR. His view, shared by Lady Hale and Lord Neuberger, was that an operational duty to conduct a proper investigation fell upon the police. Lord Hughes was more restrictive in his view, however, considering that only structural or systemic failings by the police should attract liability under the Convention.

> [!summary]
> Article 3 protects the right not to be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
> - Article 3 is an absolute right in respect of the state’s negative obligations. Whether treatment meets the respective thresholds for torture or inhuman degrading treatment will depend upon its nature, severity and effects ([[Ireland v UK (1979-80) 2 EHRR 25]]; [[R (B) v Responsible Medical Officer, Broadmoor Hospital [2005] EWHC 1936 Admin]]).
> - Article 3 also places a positive duty on the state (Soering; Chahal), and an investigative duty ([[DSD and NBV v Commissioner of the Metropolis [2018] UKSC 11]]).

## Article 5

ECHR protects the right to liberty and security of the person. It contains limited rights from which contracting states can seek to derogate in emergency situations under article 15, ECHR. Paragraph (1) contains the basic substantive right, and paragraphs (2) to (5) provide additional due process rights to which a detainee is entitled. 

> [!statute] Article 5: right to liberty and security
> (1) Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No
> one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and
> in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
> - (a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;
> - (b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;
> - (c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;
> - (d) the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;
> - (e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;
> - (f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.
> 
> (2) Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.
> 
> (3) Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.
> 
> (4) Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.
> 
> (5) Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.

#### Art 5(1): deprivation of liberty

Article 5(1) states that ‘no one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law’. The ‘cases’ referred to are the limitations to the right contained in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) – in other words, the restricted circumstances in which the state can lawfully deprive a person of their liberty.

The ‘cases’ cover circumstances including criminal and immigration arrest and detention. In addition to the deprivation of liberty having to fall within one of the limitations in 5(1)(a) to (f), it must also be ‘prescribed by law’ which means that there must be a sufficiently clear legal basis for the deprivation. The ECtHR has developed a particular approach to this question.

It is firstly important to note that article 5 is not engaged unless a person has been deprived of their liberty.

In [[Engel v Netherlands (1976) 1 EHRR 647]], the ECtHR held that article 5(1) was not concerned with mere restrictions on liberty; it only relates to deprivations of liberty. The court specified that the starting point for distinguishing between a deprivation and a restriction is the ‘concrete situation’ the person is in. A range of criteria must be looked at, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question.

The principles in Engel were reiterated by the ECtHR in [[Guzzardi v Italy (1980) 3 EHRR 333]], which added that the difference between deprivation and restriction of liberty is one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance. The court in that case referred to detention in prison and ‘strict’ arrest as being classic forms of deprivation of liberty but noted that it can take numerous other forms.

The distinction between a deprivation of liberty and a mere restriction on liberty is discussed further in relation to ‘kettling’ and ‘control orders.’

##### Kettling

One of the most contentious issues in this area has been the use by the police of a practice known as 'kettling' to control large crowds, particularly demonstrations. This involves placing a cordon around the crowd in order to confine it to a specific area, sometimes for several hours. The compatibility of this with article 5 was addressed by the ECtHR in [[Austin v UK [2012] 55 EHRR 14]].

In the earlier House of Lords judgment, the court had considered that the cordon was comparable to other crowd control measures such as keeping opposing supporters apart at a football match in order to prevent violence. Such measures would not be considered a deprivation of liberty so long as they were proportionate and not imposed arbitrarily.

The majority in the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR agreed and concluded that article 5 was not to be interpreted in such a way as to make it impracticable for the police to fulfil their duties of maintaining order and protecting the public, and that the imposition of an absolute cordon had been the least intrusive and most effective crowd control measure to avoid a real risk of serious injury or damage to property. Therefore, it did not amount to a deprivation of liberty under article 5(1).

The majority stressed that this conclusion was based on the specific and exceptional facts of the case and that it may have become a deprivation, had it not remained necessary throughout the day.

##### Control orders

Another way that article 5(1) has become engaged in the domestic context is through anti-terrorism measures called ‘control orders.’ Following the government’s defeat in the ‘Belmarsh case’ ([[A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56]]), control orders were introduced by the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. They were designed to control the movements and activities of certain individuals for the purpose of providing protection against terrorist activity.

The Home Office’s justification for these orders was that they were not sufficiently restrictive to amount to a deprivation of liberty in the first place and therefore there was no need for the UK to derogate from article 5, as it had previously done in 2001.

In [[Re JJ [2007] UKHL 45]] the law lords upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal that certain ‘non-derogating’ control orders imposed by the Home Secretary did in fact amount to a deprivation of liberty. They therefore engaged the protection of article 5(1) and were subsequently declared unlawful.

Re JJ can be contrasted with two other cases: [[Secretary of State for the Home Department v E [2007] UKHL 47]], and [[AF [2007] UKHL 46]]. Their lordships said that the starting point for considering the degree of restraint was the core issue of physical confinement. The periods of confinement were far less than for JJ and considered cumulatively with the other restrictions, it was found that the effects of the control orders did not amount to deprivations of liberty.

#### Prescribed by law (“PBL”)

A deprivation of liberty will constitute a violation of article 5(1) unless two conditions are satisfied. The first is that the deprivation must have been prescribed by law. The ECtHR has established an important test for determining this point which features with respect to article 5 (and also the ‘qualified rights’).

Under this test it must be shown that the interference with the Convention right has some basis in national law ([[Silver v UK (1983) 5 EHRR 347]]). That basis can be in a legislative provision or in case law. The requirement, that the state must be able to point to a specific legal rule or regime which authorises its conduct, gives the individual protection against arbitrary interferences with rights. Additionally, as identified in [[Sunday Times v UK (1979-80) 2 EHRR 245]], the identified legal basis must have certain qualities:
> ‘Firstly, the law must be adequately accessible: the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case. Secondly, a norm cannot be regarded as a "law" unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct: he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.’

The court emphasised that the legal basis does not have to be absolutely clear and precise:
> ‘Those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice.'

It is worth noting that the approach to PBL in Sunday Times concerned an article 10 case, but in [[Steel and Others v UK (2000) 28 EHRR 603]] the ECtHR confirmed that the Sunday Times ‘test’ would apply to other relevant articles as well (including art. 5).

Subsequent cases have provided further examples of the PBL test in Sunday Times, including guidance on how it should be interpreted and applied.

##### Early cases

In [[Wingrove v UK (1997) 24 EHRR 1]], the ECtHR rejected a submission that the criminal offence of blasphemy was so uncertain that it was inordinately difficult to foresee whether a particular publication would constitute an offence. It held that blasphemy laws cannot by their very nature lend themselves to precise legal definition. The applicant could have reasonably foreseen with appropriate legal advice that his film would have fallen within the scope of the offence. (This case related to article 10).

What is required for the consequences to be ‘foreseeable’ will depend to a considerable degree on the content of the legal provision in issue, the field it is designed to cover, and the number and status of those to whom it is addressed ([[Hashman and Harrup v UK (2000) 30 EHRR 241]]).

In the contrasting cases of [[Steel and Others v UK (2000) 28 EHRR 603]], and [[Hashman and Harrup v UK (2000) 30 EHRR 241]], the ECtHR had to consider whether ‘binding over orders’ which were common law penalties, were sufficiently clear in the context of each case so as to be prescribed by law.

As a result of the body of case law that developed from these decisions, the ECtHR declared in [[Gillan and Quinton v UK (2010) 50 EHRR 45]] that:
> 'For domestic law to meet these requirements [in Sunday Times] it must afford a measure of legal protection against arbitrary interferences by public authorities with the rights safeguarded by the Convention. In matters affecting fundamental rights it would be contrary to the rule of law, one of the basic principles of a democratic society enshrined in the Convention, for a legal discretion granted to the executive to be expressed in terms of an unfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate with sufficient clarity the scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent authorities and the manner of its exercise.’

The case involved stop and search powers used by the Metropolitan Police under [s. 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/44).

The decision in Gillan can be contrasted with the Supreme Court case of [[R (Roberts) v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [2015] UKSC 79]] although they concern similar facts and legislative provisions.

#### Art 5(1)(c)

The other condition for a deprivation of liberty to be lawful is that it must be justified by one of the limitations (or ‘cases’) provided for in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of article 5(1). Article 5(1)(c) of the ECHR is the most important of the limitations.

It states that a person may be deprived of their liberty where that person is being lawfully arrested and detained:
>'for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so’.

This breaks down into two limbs. The first covers arrest and detention on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence.

[[Fox, Campbell and Hartley v UK (1990) 13 EHRR 157]] is the key case on the 'reasonable suspicion’ requirement within article 5(1)(c). The ECtHR held that, even under an emergency situation, the first limb of article 5(1)(c) required there to be reasonable suspicion, meaning that there had to be evidence of 'facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence’.

The second limb of article 5(1)(c) permits arrest and detention ‘when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so'. The ECtHR declared in [[Ostendorf v Germany 34 BHRC 738]] that the test for reasonableness is the same as that in Fox, Campbell & Hartley v UK.

There has been a disagreement between the ECtHR and the UK Supreme Court over the scope of this second limb. In Ostendorf, the majority of the ECtHR held that the detention of a person under the second limb of article 5(1)(c) must be for the purpose of bringing him before a competent legal authority. It did not permit the detention of a football hooligan for the duration of a football match in order to prevent him engaging in violence during the match.

However, in [[R (Hicks) v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2017] UKSC 9]], the Supreme Court disagreed with this analysis and chose to follow the reasoning of the minority in Ostendorf instead.

The issue was finally resolved by the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in [[S, V & A v Denmark [2019] 68 EHRR 17]] in favour of the perspective taken by the Supreme Court in Hicks. The Grand Chamber departed from Ostendorf and held that, in order to ensure that it was not impracticable for the police to fulfil their duties, the second limb of article 5(1)(c) should be capable of permitting short-term detention of a person outside of criminal proceedings for the purpose of preventing a concrete and specific offence.

#### Art 5(2): reasons

Article 5(2), ECHR provides that:
> Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.

The case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley v UK, referred to above, also involved discussion of article 5(2). On this point, the court held that simply informing someone at the time of their arrest that they were being arrested on suspicion of being a terrorist, which was a broad allegation, did not amount to a sufficient reason and therefore failed to satisfy this part of the article. However, subsequent questioning in relation to specific offences did provide enough detail for the persons questioned to understand why they had been arrested, within a reasonable timeframe. Therefore, the police had not ultimately breached article 5(2) in this situation.

#### Art 5(3): length of detention

Article 5(3) is one of the most important due process guarantees. It provides the right for a person arrested and detained under article 5(1)(c) to be 'brought promptly before a judge'. The purpose of this was described by the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in [[McKay v UK (2007) 44 EHRR 41]]

In [[Brogan v UK (1989) 11 EHRR 117]], the ECtHR took a restrictive approach to the requirement of promptness. The court noted that the French text of article 5(3) used the word ‘aussitôt’ which means ‘immediately’, drawing the conclusion that there could only be a limited degree of flexibility in interpreting the word ‘promptly’.

It accepted that the investigation of terrorist offences presents national authorities with special problems which can justify prolonging the detention period before an individual is brought before a judge. Nevertheless, it held that detention after arrest of a terrorism suspect, for a period of four days and six hours without judicial authorisation, was too long. Permitting detention for such a period would seriously weaken the procedural guarantee against arbitrary interferences with the right to liberty embodied in the article.

The Grand Chamber (in McKay v UK) treated Brogan as establishing a maximum period of four days for such detention. However, the ECtHR has emphasised in subsequent cases that shorter periods of detention without judicial authorisation can still be incompatible with article 5(3).

One example of this is provided by [[Ipek v Turkey (2009) App Nos 17019 02 & 30070 02]] which involved the detention of three 16-year-old boys for a period of three days and nine hours before they were brought before a court. Turkey sought to justify this delay by arguing that the suspects had been arrested for terrorism offences as part of a complex case.

However, the ECtHR held that the detention was not sufficiently prompt. It emphasised that the boys were minors at the time of the arrest. Other safeguards against arbitrary conduct by the State such as access to a lawyer were absent. Moreover, the police had failed to take any investigative measures during the detention other than to question the boys on the second day. As such, there were no special difficulties or exceptional circumstances which would have prevented the authorities from bringing the applicants before a judge much sooner.

These latter cases all involved the arrest of persons on suspicion of having committed an offence. It was noted above that article 5(1)(c) can also permit the short-term detention of a person outside criminal proceedings for the purpose of preventing a concrete and specific offence. In [[S, V & A v Denmark [2019] 68 EHRR 17]], the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR emphasised that, where a person is subject to this form of preventative detention, the ‘promptness’ requirement in article 5(3) should be a matter of hours rather than days.

#### Art 5(4): lawfulness of ongoing detention

Article 5(4) states that a person who has been deprived of his liberty by being arrested or detained:
> ‘shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.’

This has been held to provide a right of review of the lawfulness of the person’s ongoing detention not only by a court of law but also by other bodies of a judicial character. For example, in [[Hirst v UK (2001) ECHR 477]], the ECtHR held that delays of 21 months and 2 years between reviews by the Parole Board of the applicant's continued detention amounted to a breach of article 5(4).

It reasoned that the requirement for decisions concerning detention to be taken speedily implied that, where automatic periodic review is required by national law, those decisions must follow at regular intervals. While the maximum period between reviews was to be determined in the light of individual circumstances, intervals of more than one year are generally not treated as being reasonable. The periods which had elapsed between reviews in this case were not justified by considerations of rehabilitation and monitoring.

#### Art 5(5): compensation

Finally, a person who is the victim of an article 5 breach by a state is entitled under article 5(5) to claim an enforceable right to compensation. However, it is section 8, HRA which provides for a remedy in UK domestic courts. Consequently, the right in article 5(5) would only come into play if an applicant ultimately needed to take their case to the ECtHR in Strasbourg.

> [!summary]
> Article 5(1) provides the basic, substantive right to liberty and sets out the circumstances in which the state can lawfully deprive persons of their liberty, such as arrest.
> - For article 5(1) to be engaged there must be a ‘deprivation’ and not a ‘mere restriction’ of liberty ([[Engel v Netherlands (1976) 1 EHRR 647]]; [[Guzzardi v Italy (1980) 3 EHRR 333]])
> - There are two requirements the state (police) must show to justify the deprivation of liberty:
> 	- One of the limitations in article 5(1) must apply. We have considered the key limitation in 5(1)(c) ([[Fox, Campbell and Hartley v UK (1990) 13 EHRR 157]]; [[R (Hicks) v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2017] UKSC 9]]).
> 	- The provision the state is relying upon must be ‘prescribed by law’ ([[Sunday Times v UK (1979-80) 2 EHRR 245]]; [[Gillan and Quinton v UK (2010) 50 EHRR 45]])
> - Articles 5(2) to 5(5) provide the due process guarantees to which a detained person is entitled.
> - Article 5(3) provides the right, once arrested and detained, to be brought promptly before a judge ([[McKay v UK (2007) 44 EHRR 41]]; [[Brogan v UK (1989) 11 EHRR 117]]).
