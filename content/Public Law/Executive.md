Power of state divided between three organisations of government. Basic structure of Executive is Monarch, Prime minister and Cabinet (21 ministers called 'Secretaries of State' and 'Lord Chancellor').

Within each administrative section:
- Secretary of State
- Minister of state
- Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State

Ministers all political appointees. Civil service is politically neutral.

Powers of Govt departments derived from statute or common law. 

Internal administrative arrangements of Govt departments generally made under prerogative powers, except for appointment of accounting officers (appointed by the Treasury). Allocation of funds to Govt departments requires parliamentary approval. 

#### Delegation of power

Most power rests high up (e.g., granting of passports is a prerogative power of the Crown). But delegated to passport officers. Legislation will say 'the Secretary of State shall…' even though they won't personally do these things. Known as a 'scheme of delegation'. But ministers remain politically answerable to Parliament. 

The principle that the actions of government department officials are synonymous with the actions of the Minister in charge was always tacitly recognised, but gained formal judicial acceptance in [[Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560 (CA)]] and became known as the Carltona Principle:

> “In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are so multifarious that no responsible minister could properly attend to them […] the duties imposed on ministers are normally exercised [under their authority] by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried out if that were not the case.”
> Lord Greene, Master of the Rolls

#### Limits on executive power

Govt can only act if expressly authorised to do so either by statute or common law. If it oversteps, the Administrative Court will intervene (not on its own accord, but if a claim is started against Govt). This process is called 'judicial review'.

#### Constitutional principles

- Laws may not be suspended without the consent of Parliament (Bill of Rights, s1)
- Taxation requires consent of Parliament, must be set out in legislation
- Habeas corpus – restrictions imposed on arbitrary imprisonment and punishment of citizens
- Freedom from arrest: monarch or Govt ministers cannot issue search/ arrest warrants
- Impeachment: Parliament can inquire into alleged illegal acts by ministers

#### Local government
Local authorities responsible for implementation of central Govt policies at local level. Parliament legislation regulates structure, powers and duties of local Govt bodies. Exercise of local Govt power also reviewable by Administrative Court.
