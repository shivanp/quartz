The traditional Diceyan theory of parliamentary supremacy has come under pressure in the last half-century. Parliament has imposed limitations upon itself as an institution which are binding, but only for as long as subsequent Parliaments wish them to be. 

## Principle of legality

The modern judiciary has sought to protect rights and freedoms through the way in which it carries out its role in **interpreting legislation**. 

Lord Hoffmann in [[R v SoS Home Department ex parte Simms [2000] ]]:
> “Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual.”

#### Statutory presumption

Hoffmann's statement established a balance between two key constitutional principles which are in tension. Very mild form of entrenchment of fundamental rights. 

Elaborated by arguing that this approach achieves a vital constitutional purpose:
> “In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.”

(though this is highly debatable).

## Exclusion of court jurisdiction

One of the most notable ways in which the courts have modified the application of legislation in order to protect rights has occurred in issues relating to the courts' own rights to determine judicial review challenges.

There have been legislative attempts to 'oust' the courts' rights to scrutinise governmental actions and decisions through judicial review. 

“Ouster clauses” are sometimes included in legislation in order to prevent decisions made using relevant statutory powers being reviewed in court. The courts' attitude towards this has been universally hostile and has been evident since the late 1960s since the case of [[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 2 AC 137]]. 

When interpreting statutes, the courts will seek, within what they consider to be their area of competence, to protect core rule of law values and freedoms. This extends to interpreting a purported total ouster clause, such as the one in issue in the _Anisminic_ case, in a highly restrictive way. This is because the purpose behind such a clause – removing the jurisdiction of the courts to review cases – is seen to represent an affront to just such a fundamental value, namely the right of individuals to challenge the use of executive powers in court.

#### Ouster clauses and sovereignty

The courts see ouster clauses as an affront to its constitutional purpose of holding the Executive to account, and, as in [[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 2 AC 137]], they have tended to use highly purposive forms of statutory interpretation to bypass the apparent intention of Parliament in the original legislation.

The approach is illustrated in cases like [[R v Home Secretary, ex parte Al Fayed [1997] 1 All ER 228]] and [[R (Privacy International) v Investigatory Powers Tribunal [2019] UKSC 22]]. 

Extra-judicial disapproval of the tactical device of ouster clauses also tends to be vociferous, e.g., during debate of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Bill in 2003-4.

#### Legality principle expanded

Legality principle was not established in the Simms case, even though it is frequently associated with it. Can be traced to a series of cases in the 90s, such as [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Leech (No 2) [1994] QB 198]]. 

[[R v Lord Chancellor, ex parte Witham [1997] 2 All ER 779]]: the approach was used to challenge the scale of court fees set by the Lord Chancellor under the authority of a statutory instrument. 

## Common law constitutionalism
> [!info]
> The idea behind common law constitutionalism is that the English common law is the repository of certain rights and freedoms that have been built up and recognised over time and which should be protected as far as possible by the courts. These are seen as running parallel and are supplementary to the rights brought into UK law by the Human Rights Act.
The ‘common law constitutional cases’ of the 2010s can in many ways be seen as an extension of the same basic theme and approach taken in those cases in the 1990s that are associated with the ‘legality principle’. Arguments have been made in recent years that the line of cases associated with the term “common law constitutionalism” represent a renewed form of activism by the courts in areas of public life.

Represent a way in which the judiciary have sought to modify and temper the more alarming consequences of a system built on Dicey's theory of unlimited parliamentary supremacy. 

These cases have created a **parallel route for rights protection**, operating alongside more formal enforcement under HRA 1998. Can be seen as a form of judicial 'insurance policy' in the event of repeal of HRA. 

Critics of judicial 'activism' point to them as examples of judicial overreach, distorting apparent parliamentary intention. Supporters point to the role of an independent judiciary, developing principles that are designed to maintain and promote constitutional safeguards and ensure the government is held to account. 

Key case: [[Osborn v. Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61]]. Lord Reed emphasised the importance in the common law of the duty of fairness in public law decision making and arguably modernised the application of this by stressing the vital importance of accountability of government and of participation by those affected by the decisions.

Though the challenge to the Board had been based on article 5(4) ECHR, Lord Reed stated that the HRA did not:

> “Supersede the protection of human rights under the common law or statute or create a discrete body of law based upon the judgments of the European Court. Human rights continue to be protected by our domestic law, interpreted and developed in accordance with the act when appropriate".

Set out a general rationale for an extension of the duty of fairness in relation to personal involvement of prisoners in the decision-making process that affected them and their future lives. Participation of prisoners in personal hearings was expanded, based on the principle that involvement in the process by those affected was an important personal right in itself, and was significant too in promoting accountability and transparency in government more generally.

## Access to and independence of courts

Recall [[R (Unison) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51]], where the Supreme Court found that a new fees regime for employment tribunals was unlawful, partly on the basis of a constitutional right of access to the courts and tribunal system known as 'access to justice'. 

Also: [[R (Evans) v Attorney General [2015] UKSC 21]]. Here the constitutional principle was a broader one. The Supreme Court found that the Attorney General had 
> “contradicted the fundamental principle that a court's decision could not be ignored or set aside by anyone, including the executive, and that the executive's actions were reviewable by the court.”

## Openness and transparency

Lord Mance called this the 'common law presumption in favour of openness'. This was a key feature in [[Kennedy v. The Charity Commission [2014] UKSC 20]]. 

Another significant case was [[Jackson v Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56]]. Jackson essentially argued that an Act of Parliament was invalid. That this went to the House of Lords represents a radical proposition in Diceyan terms, given earlier firm adherence to the [[Parliamentary sovereignty#Enrolled Bill rule]], in cases such as [[Pickin v British Railways Board [1974] AC 765]]. In orbiter comments, judges such as Lords Steyn and Hope and Lady Hale clearly showed significant concern in Jackson about a form of undiluted majoritarianism operating in the UK.

See [[O'Hara v. Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [1997] AC 286]] for the requirement of reasonableness.
