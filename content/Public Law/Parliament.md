# Roles in Parliament

- Government and Opposition sit facing each other
- Govt on right of speaker
- Frontbenchers and backbenchers

## House of Commons figures

#### Speaker of the House
- Politically neutral (by convention)
- Elected by Commons
- Presides over Parliamentary debates
- Disciplinary role:
	- Directing MP withdraw abusive or denigrating remarks
	- Suspending sitting of House due to serious disorder (rare)
	- Suspending MPs who are deliberately disobedient ('naming')
	- Ordering MPs to be quiet
- Does not normally vote in parliament or participate in debates
- Controls how long debates last: MPs do not have an automatic right to speak during debates. Considers:
	- Standard practice of calling official spokespeople from Govt and Opposition to start and finish debate
	- Whether MPs have specific interest in topic debated
	- MPs seniority and previous contribution
	- Time available
	- Protecting rights of parliamentary minorities
- Controls which amendments to proposed legislation (bills) can be debated and voted on, and whether to allow urgent questions or emergency debates
	- Exercise of this power can lead to accusations that the Speaker is acting politically.
	- Speaker will balance:
		- Need to protect parliamentary minorities
		- Amendments which are 'out of order' will not be debated (vague, not properly related, or submitted late)
		- Related amendments can be debated together
	- Upholds parliamentary rules, known as **'Standing Orders'**
	- Can make definitive interpretations of parliamentary rules and procedures through **“Speaker's rulings”.** Advice drawn from Clerk and Deputy Speakers.
	- Role exercised and governed almost entirely by convention. MPs can criticise the Speaker by putting down a substantive motion for debate. If MPs vote to criticise ('censure') the Speaker's behaviour, they will come under pressure to resign.

Usually not politically controversial, until John Bercow. Sep 2019 allowed emergency debate, paving the way for backbench MPs to take control of Parliamentary timetable, passing legislation requiring government to seek a time extension for leaving the EU to avoid no deal Brexit. 

#### Deputy Speakers

The Commons elects three Deputy Speakers. Principal Deputy Speaker called the “Chairman of Ways and Means”. Elected from opposite side of House of Commons as Speaker. Four distinct roles:
- Supervision of arrangements for sittings in Westminster Hall
- General oversight of private bills matters
- Chair of the Panel of Chairs, responsible for work of general committees
- Presiding over annual Budget debate.

Two other Deputy Speakers: First and Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means. 

Deputy speakers do not resign from their parties, but do withdraw from any active political role.

#### Leader of the House

Govt minister whose main responsibility is organising government business in the House. Consists of:
- Scheduling business
- Chairing Parliamentary Business and Legislation Committee
- Deputising for PM in some circumstances (rare)

Works closely with the Chief Whip (Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury). 

#### Shadow Leader of the House

Member of the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet. Works with Leader of the House to arrange Commons' business. 

#### Whips

Whips are MPs or Lords appointed by each party in Parliament to manage their party's contribution to parliamentary business. One of the whip's key responsibilities is making sure the maximum number of their party members participate in voting in support of their party, and in enforcing party discipline generally. 

Also, responsible for:
- Counting votes
- Arranging business of Parliament (known in this capacity as 'the usual channels')

Each week they send out a circular ('The Whip') to MPs and Lords detailing upcoming parliamentary business. Special attention paid to divisions (where MPs vote on debates). Important divisions underlined 3 times (a three-line whip).

Defying a three-line whip can result in the whip being 'withdrawn' from an MP or Lord. So member keeps seat in constituency but expelled from political party, and has to sit as an independent MP under whip restored.

## House of Lords figures

Lord Speaker chairs daily business and gives procedural advice. Has a deputy, the Senior Deputy Speaker. 

The Leader of the House of Lords is a Minister and Cabinet member, who is the most senior representative of government in the Lords.

'Black Rod' is a senior officer of Lords, responsible for maintaining order in the House. 

Plays a role in the state opening of Parliament: sent from the Lords to summon the Commons to hear the Queen's speech. Doors of the chamber traditionally slammed in his face, then allowed in after 3 knocks. 

# Workings of Parliament

Rules governing business of Commons derive from:

- “Ancient usage” (convention)
- Standing Orders passed by the House following a convention
- Rulings of the Speaker

Guidance on workings of the House of Commons: “Erskine May's Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings, and Usage of Parliament”. 

## Rules

Parliament's procedural rules are not binding, but nevertheless respected by all parliamentarians. 

#### Presumption in favour of government business

Presumption: government business takes precedence in the parliamentary timetable. 

Standing Order 14:
>“Save as provided in this order, government business shall have precedence at every sitting”

Does not have legal force, but effectively by consent. Govt can vote to dis-apply SO 14, as during Brexit debates. 

#### Parliamentary sessions

Each session lasts around a year, but can last longer. Begins with Queen's Speech (written by Govt). 

#### Resolving disputes

One of the Speaker's main roles is resolving parliamentary disputes. This can involve disputes where whips from opposing parties cannot reach agreement on procedure, and backbenchers feel their concerns are not getting enough parliamentary time. 

#### Daily business

Sittings in both Houses of Parliament begin with saying of prayers (attendance voluntary). 

Question Time on Mondays to Thursdays, for 1 hour. Three days' notice for questions must be given. Can also be in writing. 

Prime Minister's Question Time: Wednesday 12-12.30pm. Subject does not need to be given in advance. 

MP may ask the Minister an Urgent Question, on permission of the Speaker. The request will be granted if the question is urgent and of public importance. Govt minister concerned must come forwards. 

If something urgent: relevant Minister may make an oral statement to the House. These are made after Oral Questions and any Urgent Questions. Not tabled in advance. Some also made in writing (if more technical/ boring).

#### Debates

- MP moves a motion
- Speaker puts a question to the House in terms of the motion
- MPs take turns to speak on the question
- Vote by calling Aye or No
- If not clear, division is called

#### Division

If no clear result from Aye's and No's division is called. So members have to register to vote by walking down different corridors. 

These are called 'Aye' and 'No' lobbies in the Commons, and 'Contents' and 'No Contents' lobbies in the Lords. 

Members counted and names recorded as they walk past. Result announced by Speaker. 

#### Hansard

Name given to transcripts of parliamentary debates and record of written questions and answers. Lists how members have voted in divisions. Not a strictly verbatim record. If an MP makes an erroneous statement which is recorded in Hansard, they must ensure it is corrected. 

[[Pepper v Hart [1991] Ch. 203]] rule:
> Clear ministerial statements in Hansard may be referred to in court in order to construe legislation only if the wording of the legislation is ambiguous, obscure or its literal meaning is absurd. 

#### Committees

Two main types:
- Select committees
	- Permanent membership
	- Scrutinise many different areas
- Legislative committees
	- Scrutinise proposals for specific legislation
	- Most common form: Public Bill Committee, appointed to debate and amend proposals for new legislation
	- MPs are selected on the basis of party strength in the Commons to scrutinise an individual bill.
	- This type of committee used to be called a ‘standing’ committee and is sometimes still referred to as such.

# Parliamentary scrutiny

## Select committees

There are select committees in both the Commons and the Lords, but they have different focuses. 

House of Commons Select Committees focus on scrutinising government departments. Each department of state is shadowed by a separate select committee. 

House of Lords Select Committees concentrate on broader and more thematic scrutiny, based on 6 areas:
- Europe
- Science and technology
- Economics
- Communications
- UK constitution
- International relations

Select committees are a key mechanism for holding the government to account. They consist of MPs, Lords or both (in the case of joint committees). Most select committees are established under Standing Orders (parliamentary rules), so their membership changes with a change of Parliament, but the committees are permanent entities. 

Committees determine the subjects into which they will inquire, and have extensive ability to gather written and oral evidence. Their findings and recommendations are submitted to the House and published as reports. 

According to the Institute for Government, the identity of the select committee Chair “determines its impact more than any other factor”. 

Select committees have been part of Parliament for a long time, but the current departmentally-based system has only been in existence since 1979. Committees are cross-party.

#### Roles

Feature | Commons Select Committees | Lords Select Committees 
---|---|---
Chair | Elected by fellow MPs. | Appointed by the House on the proposal of the Committee of Selection
Membership | Minimum 11 members | No fixed number of members
Appointment of members | Internal party selection. Membership confined to backbench MPs by convention. | Proposed by Committee of Selection and voted on by House
Politics | Membership reflects party-political balance of House | No political bias
Examples | Public Accounts Committee, Transport Committee, Committee on Standards | Constitution Committee, Intergenerational Fairness and Provision Committee, Gambling Industry Committee


The government is committed to replying to every select committee report within 60 days of its publication. So Select Committees can influence the direction of government by:
- Writing reports for the House
- Attracting media attention to a political issue
- Encouraging ministers to engage properly with an issue, knowing they will be called to give evidence at a select committee meeting.

#### Joint select committees

Joint Committees consist of both MPs and Lords. There are four:
- Joint Committee on Human Rights
	- HR in the UK
- Joint Committee for National Security Strategy
	- Structures of government decision-making on national security scrutinised
	- Particularly National Security Council and National Security Advisor
- Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments
	- Considers statutory instruments made in exercise of powers granted by Act of Parliament
- Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills
	- Existing Acts of Parliament on the same subject brought together into one Act without amending the law
	- Sometimes minor corrections/ improvements

#### Summoning powers

House of Commons select committees have powers to 'send for persons, papers, and records'. If any witness who has been summoned to appear before a select committee refuses to attend, the fact is reported to the House and order made for his attendance at the bar to be admonished by the Speaker (Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice (24th Edn, 2011) p 820). 

MPs, Ministers, Lords and civil servants (under Osmotherly Rules) cannot be summoned in this way. 

If the witness does not attend willingly, the Select Committee may issue a summons. If that is ignored, a warrant may be issued. Then the police can get involved. 

> “If a Select Committee has issued a summons to a witness to attend, or produce papers, and the witness has not responded, it is for the House to act (or not) on the basis of a Report made to it by the committee. The House may order the Serjeant at Arms as Warrant Officer of the House to serve a Warrant on the witness. In serving the Warrant, the Serjeant or his appointee may call on the full assistance of the civil authorities, including the police.”
> (House of Commons Information Office 'Disciplinary and Penal Powers of the House' September 2010).

 A resolution can be passed in the House that the person has been in “contempt of Parliament”.

#### Giving evidence

Ministers and civil servants frequently appear, as well as senior company employees. 2018 Mark Zuckerberg declined several invitations to give evidence at an international grand committee of parliamentary select committees.
