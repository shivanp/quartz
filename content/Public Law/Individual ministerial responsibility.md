# Individual ministerial responsibility

Twin convention to collective ministerial responsibility is 'individual ministerial responsibility' — IMR. Plays a role in accountability of Govt. The doctrine of Individual Ministerial Responsibility is supplemented and shadowed by more recent innovation to Ministerial Code.

## Issues of competence

The competence rule originally held that Ministers were answerable to the Commons for every action undertaken by their departments' civil servants. Rationale: Ministers took credit when officials got things right, so should take the blame when staff get things wrong. Resignations expected if error was serious. 

As a corollary: individual civil servants would not face parliamentary scrutiny or public criticism for any of their own failings. Would still face sanctions, but not in the political sphere. 

But by the 1800s this was barely credible due to the growth in scale of government. This was a slow transition, but the evolution of rules came to a head with the 1954 [[Crichel Down affair]]. Dugdale resigned when it became clear he had specific knowledge of his civil servants' activities, but had failed to appreciate the problematic nature of the action being undertaken. 

The controversy involved the reneging on a promise by civil servants in his department and led to an inquiry, following which a number of recommendations were made, which shaped the future direction of the convention. Led to Maxwell Fief guidelines. 

Uncertainty:
- Unavoidable entanglement with short term realities of political world
- Assessing degree of fault and responsibility in a modern 'big government'

#### Maxwell Fyfe guidelines

Distinguish between situations in which the relevant minister had personal involvement or knowledge of the issue or error and not. Sets out different scenarios:

Situation | Guideline for minister resigning
---|---
If explicit order made by a minister, the minister must protect the civil servant carrying out the order. | Resign
When civil servant acts properly according to policy laid down by minister | Resign
Where official makes mistake/ causes delay, but not on important policy issue | Don't resign
Where civil servant takes action of which minister disapproved and had no prior knowledge, and officer conduct reprehensible. | Don't resign

The convention, it is said, reflects political reality: when a serious failure occurs in government, the media, and the public will inevitably look to the minister for answers—the “_Today_ programme test”. 

Resignation is more likely to be triggered by a failure of policy, rather than implementation, since the former is more obviously within the scope of Ministers. 

Examples:
- James Callaghan's 1967 resignation as Chancellor from Harold Wilson's second Labour government precipitated by policy failure: sterling was devalued under his watch (even though this was arguably more due to actions of previous governments).
- Lord Carrington's resignation as Foreign Secretary 1982 after Falkland Islands invasion. He thought it necessary that someone took responsibility for underestimating the severity of the Argentinian threat. 

#### Further development of IMR

Partial redefinition of convention to require personal knowledge/involvement of minister becoming more pronounced. 

- Michael Fagan walked around Buckingham Palace for hours before chatting with the Queen. William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary, didn't resign despite being formally 'responsible' for the Met Police. 
- 1983 NI secretary James Prior did not resign after mass breakout of 38 IRA prisoners from Maze prison. Cited policy/operational divide and sacked prison governor instead, after it emerged that the escape resulted from management errors.
- Kenneth Baker (Home Secretary) did not resign after another IRA prison break in 1991 from Brixton prison. Chief Inspector of Prisons had reported months earlier that security at Brixton was inadequate for high risk prisoners, but Home Office did nothing. 
- Similarly, Michael Howard asked to resign after escape of 6 high category prisoners from Whitemoor Prison, 1994. Dispute with Director of Prison Service, who he dismissed. 

Accountability vs responsibility, Today programme test.

Competence limb of convention seems to be in a fluid/ fragile state. Need to focus on scale of mistake, but also strength of Minister's position within the governing party. 

## Errors of judgement
Resignation seems to be more common for Ministers making severe errors of judgement. 

- Westland Affair: the Trade Secretary Leon Brittan authorised the leaking of a letter from the Solicitor-General criticising the constitutional propriety of Michael Heseltine's behaviour, and was subsequently forced to resign. Thatcher forced to defend her own role before the Commons. 
- Nicholas Ridley resigned as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in 1990 after expressing hostile attitudes towards Germany in a press interview.
- Edwina Currie resigned in 1988 after alleging that almost all UK egg production was infected by salmonella. 
- Mandelson and Robinson resigned from Blair government through concealment of loans. 

Difficult to extract a rule: party-political expediency rather than moral principle seems to be critical factor. Finer: a Minister's errors will not invariably precipitate resignation unless her conduct has alienated a substantial body of opinion within her own party.

David Laws super popular but resigned after expenses scandal (turned out his landlord was his male partner, had not revealed this to conceal sexual orientation).

## Morality

- Profumo affair: Christine Keeler simultaneously sleeping with a Russian Naval Attaché. Crucially, he lied to the Commons when questioned, which led to resignation.
- Cecil Parkinson resigned from Cabinet in 1983 after exposed as cheating, but re-entered Cabinet in 1987
- David Mellor 1992 affair with young actress, despite married with children. Held onto office for some months until accepting gifts scandal also came to light.  

Unclear why there is a respected convention that sexual 'misbehaviour' of male Ministers should lead to resignation. Maybe hypocrisy of participating in activities in which the government supposedly disapproves. 

## Conclusion

Note all these transgressions are unquantifiable and judgement based, so for the best if left as conventions rather than being justiciable. Non-justiciability may be an essential ingredient of conventional status!

#### Accountability

More emphasis on direct forms of accountability. Ministers need to keep parliament informed of issues, after lessons drawn in Scott Report 1996 (investigating sales of arms to Saddam Hussain's Iraq in 1980s). 

Emphasis on accountability and openness key trends. Features on ministerial code:

> "Ministers have a duty to Parliament to account, and be held to account, for the policies, decisions and actions of their departments and agencies."

>"It is of paramount importance that Ministersgive accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister"
