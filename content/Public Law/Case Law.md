## Framework

Common law system governed by rules of precedent: decisions from higher courts binding on lower courts. Judges decide cases brought by legal personalities, after considering the applicable law making judgments [^1]

[^1]: without an e, meaning final outcome of court hearing. 

## Making the law

Traditional theory: judges make the law, but only so far as they declare what the law has always been. Precedent is then thought of as retrospective: judicial decisions based on statements of legal principle which have always existed, but not fully expressed until a certain case is brought before a court. So judges cautious about upsetting [[Rules of precedents]]. In contrast, statute law prospective. 

## Stare decisis

Binding precedent or literally, 'stand by what has been decided'. Once a principle of law has been laid down, future cases with same material facts must be decided in the same way. 

This is provided earlier case was decided by a binding court for the current court, and relevant part of case was binding (rather than just 'persuasive'). 

Judgement consists of:
1. statement of the facts
2. statements of law, including
	1. [[Ratio decidendi]] (reasoning for decision). This is binding on other courts; the legal principle on whcih the court's decision is based
	2. [[Obiter dicta]] (other things said/ said in passing)
3. Courts decision on remedy - binding only to parties to the case


## Terminology

- Court can directly *follow the decision* of earlier cases. If the court doing the following is a higher curt, then the later decision is also said to be *approving* the earlier one. 
- If earlier case is similar but not the same, court is *applying* the earlier decision. 
- And can choose not to follow a binding precedent if case can be *distinguished*.
- Judgment can be *reversed* if a higher appeal court disagrees. This does not mean that a precedent has been negated, just that the higher court has not applied the precedent in the same way. 
- Precedent *overruled/ overturned* if superior court decides original precedent from past case is wrong. 
- If a judgment is reversed or precedent overturned but only in part, some elements of the former decision may remain intact.

Departing from own precedent → used to be impossible, then Appellate Committee of House of Lords in 1966 made this legit ([[Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) 1 WLR 1234]]): Lord Gardiner L.C. stated that the law lords 
> “recognise[d] that too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law.”

In [[Austin v Southwark LBC [2010] UKSC 28]], Lord Hope confirmed that the (new) Supreme Court would maintain the same guarded but potentially flexible approach.

## [[Court of Appeal]]

Similar story: in special scenarios, precedents can be overturned ([[Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd [1944] KB 718]]). These are: 
1. If previous CA decisions were conflicting, can choose one.
2. If previous decision overruled by Supreme Court or House of Lords, need not be followed. 
3. If previous decision made *per incuriam* (in error – without following a relevant authority in case or statute).
