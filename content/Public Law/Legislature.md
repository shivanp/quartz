Parliament is the supreme legislative body in the UK, acts under and within the symbolic power of the Queen. Known formally as 'the Queen in Parliament'.

MPs have constituencies, whose interests they represent. 

Under Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, general elections held on first Thursday in May every 5 years. 

Can also trigger election by 
- Vote of no confidence in HMG
- Motion for general election agreed by 2/3 of Commons

The political party winning overall majority of seats will form Govt. First past the post system. If no single party wins a majority, have a 'hung Parliament'. Then largest party can form minority Govt/enter a coalition. 

Can be other changes of PM, e.g., if incumbent resigns. Then PM elected by members of political party. 

PM is Queen's principal adviser, chairs Cabinet, has overall responsibility for Govt responsibility

Govt held to account: Prime Minister's Questions Wednesdays midday. 

Speaker is by convention politically impartial. Has powers to enforce rules of behaviour, e.g., by suspending MPs who don't behave appropriately.

Two types of parliamentary committee:
- Select committees: permanent committees that investigate work of individual Govt departments or broader policy areas
- Public bill committees: Appointed to debate and amend proposals for new legislation.

- Hereditary peerages passed down through families; life peerages granted by the monarch, on the advice of the PM. 
- 1999 House of Lords Act reduced no. of hereditary peers to 91. Remainder life peers/ bishops.

Constitutional reform:
- Constitutional Reform Act 2005: House of Lords' judicial function separated from Parliament. End of Lord Chancellor's combined role as head of judiciary, member of executive and speaker of Lords.
- Before this, the most senior court in the UK was the 'Appellate Committee of the House of Lords'. This consisted of 12 judges appointed as members of the House of Lords, known as 'Lords of Appeal in Ordinary' or 'law Lords'.
- 2009 Lords' judicial function formally transferred to Supreme Court (UKSC). Sits in building opposite Houses of Parliament (other side of Parliament Square)

Lords may scrutinise and make amendments to legislation approved by the Commons. Powers regulated by application of conventions. 

Govt defeats in the Lords usually result in amendments to legislation by Govt.
