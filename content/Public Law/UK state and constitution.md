## History

Fiefdoms and stuff, Act of Union between England and Scotland 1707 created Kingdom of Great Britain.

Settlement of Ireland, 1800 Act of Union led to 1801 United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. 1937/49 -> republic of Ireland. 

Troubles, devolution, Greater London Authority, regional mayors

## Purpose of constitution
- Govt power within legal limits, accountability
- Devolved
- Rights and freedoms of citizens

Sovereign power used to mean the monarch, now means source of primary authority. 

State functions:
- [[Legislature]]
- [[Executive]]
- [[Judiciary]]

Incorrect to say UK has no written constitution; just that it is not codified in a single document. Acts of Parliament main source of constitutional law. But not all Acts of Parliament are constitutional. 

Thoburn v Sunderland City Council [2002] 3 W.L.R 247 (p.62), Laws LJ suggested:
> _[W]e should recognise a hierarchy of Acts of Parliament: as it were "ordinary" statutes and ‘constitutional’ statutes […] in my opinion a constitutional statute is one which (a) **conditions the legal relationship between the citizen and the state in some general, overarching manner** and (b) enlarges or diminishes the scope of what we would now regard as fundamental constitutional rights"._

Case law: 
It is a fundamental constitutional rule that the state cannot exercise power unless that power is expressly authorised by law. 

Conventions: important in UK law (e.g. that the Queen does not refuse royal assent to Bills of Parliament after they pass through Houses).

Because constitution not codified, actually really easy to change on the most part, just need an Act of Parliament. Meanwhile US requires 2/3 majority in both houses and ratification by 3/4 of states to amend constitution. 

## Constitutional conventions

Defined in Cabinet Manual as
> "rules of constitutional practice that are regarded as **binding in operation but not in law.**"

Cabinet manual sets out all the conventions on how the executive should operate. Codified and published 2011 under Cameron for transparency. 

Conventions useful:
- Reflect contemporary constitutional values
- Regulate relationships between various institutions
- Underpin operation of Cabinet system, regulate relations between House of Lords and House of Commons, between Executive and Monarch, between judiciary and other organisations

#### Legislature conventions
- Lords should defer to Commons
- Lords should not reject at second reading any govt legislation passed by Commons and that carries out a manifesto commitment (Salisbury-Addison Convention)
- Financial bills only introduced by a Cabinet minister in the House of Commons
- Westminster will not legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland, Wales, NI without consent of devolved administrations (Sewel Convention)
- Commons should be consulted before govt embarks on any major foreign policy initiatives involving armed forces

Conventions do not impose a legal obligation on the Lords, but rather a moral one which the Lords ought to follow rather than being compelled to. The Parliament Act procedure, though dealing with potential disputes between Commons and Lords over the passage of legislation, can only be implemented after what is effectively a year’s delay by the Lords.

#### Executive conventions
- Monarch follows advice given by Ministers
- Monarch will not exercise her legal right to refuse royal assent to bills passed through Parliament
- Monarch appoints as PM leader of political party able to command the confidence of House of Commons
- PM chooses Cabinet Ministers
- PM and Chancellor should be MPs
- After vote of no confidence by Commons, Govt will resign and advise monarch to dissolve Parliament, leading to a general election (though Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 complicates things)
- Monarch asked for consent on legislation affecting her interests

#### Judiciary conventions
- Judges should not be politically active
- Parliament must not criticise professional conduct of judges

#### Conventions and the law
Not matters of law, so cannot be enforced, but the courts recognise and acknowledge their significance. In [[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5]] Supreme Court rejected argument that Govt was legally bound to seek consent of Scottish Parliament before triggering Article 50 – said this was a convention which could be ignored. 

So consequences of breaking convention are political tutting rather than legal. 

## Devolution

Under Laws of Wales Acts 1535-42, administration of Welsh territories fully incorporated into Kingdom of England. 1707 political union between England and Scotland. Then 1801 Acts of Union. Then 1922 creation of Republic of Ireland. 

Devolved legislatures and administrations are:

| Devolved legislature      | Devolved administration    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Scottish Parliament       | Scottish Government        |
| Senedd (Welsh Parliament) | Welsh Government           |
| Northern Ireland Assembly | Northern Ireland Executive |

Devolved legislation cannot be created without the enabling powers of Act of UK Parliament. These were granted in Scotland Acts 1998 and 2016, Govt of Wales Acts 1998 and 2006, Wales Act 2017, Northern Ireland Acts 1998 and 2006. 

Devolved matters include education and environment in Scotland. All devolved laws still subject to review by the Supreme Court, which has power to determine disputes over jurisdiction between devolved administrations and Westminster. 

Reserved matters include immigration, defence and foreign policy. Responsibility for fiscal policy and public expenditure belongs to HM Treasury, though Scottish and Welsh Govt have some control over raising revenue. 

Aim of devolution is decentralising Govt power, reflects importance of nationalist opinion. Devolution was introduced after public referendums in devolved nations in 1997-8. 

#### Scotland

General rule: Acts of Parliament extend to Scotland only if they deal with reserved matters. s 28(8) of Scotland Act 1998: 
> UK Parliament will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. 

This consent to legislate on a devolved matter will usually be indicated by a Legislative Consent Motion in the devolved Parliament. 

This is the statutory recognition of Sewel Convention, though it does not give binding legal effect to it ([[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5]]). And s 28(7) of Scotland Act: the power of the Scottish Parliament to pass Acts “does not affect the power of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to make laws for Scotland”. 

#### Wales

Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, Wales is not a separate legal jurisdiction from England. But applicable law may be different in England and Wales. 

The Wales Act 2017 extended the powers devolved to Wales under the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GOWA). Welsh Govt is now based on reserved matters model, similar to Scotland.

Matters reserved to the UK Government are listed in Schedule 7A GOWA 2006. Act of Parliament will only apply to Wales if they deal with reserved matters. 

Sewel Convention also reflected in Government of Wales Act 2006 (GOWA) s107(6). Consent of Senedd (known until 2020 as the National Assembly for Wales) sought by way of Legislative Consent Motion. 

s 107(5) makes it clear that the power of the Senedd to make Acts "does not affect the power of the UK to make laws for Wales". This is the equivalent of s 28(7) of the Scotland Act. 

#### Northern Ireland

- NI Assembly (Stormont) is the devolved legislature, 90 democratically elected members
- Based on power-sharing matters
- Same general rule: reserved matters model
- Sewel Convention applies
- s 5(6) Northern Ireland Act provides that the UK Parliament may still legislate on devolved matters without such consent. 

## The Monarch

UK is a constitutional monarchy. Activities of government still carried out in the name of the monarch, so Executive referred to as 'the Crown' and 'Her Majesty's Government'. Monarch retains personal powers (limited by constitutional convention):
- Appointing PM
- Dissolving Parliament in some circumstances
- Giving 'Royal Assent' to Acts of Parliament.

'R' stands for 'Regina' – the Crown in criminal cases. Judicial review cases also brought in the name of the Crown. Highlights the fact that a judicial review is a public law matter. 

#### Royal prerogative

Refers to powers historically vested in the monarch, not statutory powers. Such powers still form part of the legal authority of the executive. Still legitimate powers, but only exercised on advice of PM. 

Prerogative powers include:
- Summoning and proroguing Parliament
- Appointing and dismissing Govt ministers
- Mobilising armed forces (including declaration of war)
- Negotiating treaties

#### Miller v Prime Minister

2019 BoJo advised Queen to prorogue Parliament for five weeks. Supreme Court decided that PM's advice was unlawful because it had effect of 

>"frustrating or preventing, without reasonable justification, the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions as a legislature and as the body responsible for the supervision of the executive"

Shows that exercise of prerogative powers by the Executive is not immune from challenge in the courts.
