## Function

The function of the Civil Service is formalised in the Cabinet Manual (2011) as

> **“The civil service supports the government of the day** to develop and implement its policies, and in delivering public services, civil servants are required to carry out their role in accordance with the values set out in the _Civil Service Code_ and the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. **Central to this is the requirement for political impartiality**. Civil servants must act solely according to the merits of the case and serve governments of different political parties equally well.”


$\exists$ civil service code and Constitutional and Governance Act 2010. Key: **political impartiality**.

There are three main constitutional principles underpinning the civil service:

| Constitutional principle | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Permanence               | The civil service does not change personnel with each new government. This creates a pool of people with specialist skills and experience from which ministers can draw. |
| Political neutrality     | Requirement of permanence; must remain neutral to remain constant                                                                                                        |
| Anonymity                | Civil servants are (mostly) not public facing. The Minister is politically accountable for the department's actions.                                                                                                                                                                         |


Ministerial code requires ministers to uphold political impartiality (general principle 5.1) 

## Structure of government departments

Govt departments hierarchy:

1. Secretary of State: senior minister and MP. Appointed by Prime Minister.
2. Special advisers (SPADS) – political appointees
3. Permanent secretaries – politically neutral
4. 'Senior Responsible Owners' – politically neutral.
5. Civil servants.

#### Accounting officers

The Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee explains the role of Accounting Officers (usually the Permanent Secretary in the Department, and always politically neutral) as follows:

> “The personal accountability of the Accounting Officer forms the foundation of Parliament's ability to hold the Executive to account for public spending. Ministers are answerable to Parliament for policy decisions and the actions of the departments and their executive agencies. The Accounting Officer, normally the Permanent Secretary in the department, is personally responsible for the regularity and propriety of expenditure, robust evaluation of different mechanisms for delivering policy objectives, value for money.”

Give evidence to parliamentary Select Committees. 

#### Senior Responsible Owners

Senior Responsible Owners (SROs) are politically neutral senior civil servants, who are personally responsible for the delivery of major government projects.

The Cabinet Manual states at paragraph 5.6 that:

> “Senior Responsible Owners of the Government’s major projects … are expected to account to Parliament, for the decisions and actions they have taken to deliver the projects for which they have personal responsibility. This line of accountability relates to implementation (not policy development).”

SROs may, therefore, be called to give evidence to Parliamentary Select Committees, together with Permanent Secretaries / Accounting Officers.

## Civil Service Code

The Civil Service is subject to a Code of rules and principles in the same way as Ministers, with the fundamental difference that civil servants (like any other employee) may be dismissed for deceit or incompetence.

Civil servants are accountable to Ministers, who in turn are accountable (at least in theory) to Parliament.

The 'core values' of the Civil Service Code are:
* Integrity
* Honesty
* Objectivity
* Impartiality

The Civil Service Code states that civil servants must:

> “Act in a way which deserves and retains the confidence of ministers, while at the same time ensuring that you will be able to establish the same relationship with those whom you may be required to serve in some future government”.

This means that it is important for civil servants not to alienate possible future ministers (i.e., senior opposition politicians) while serving the government of the day.

The Code is part of the “contractual relationship” between the civil servant and the government department. Breach of the Code is therefore tantamount to breach of an employment contract. Bear in mind that civil servants cannot be dismissed (at least formally) by ministers.

## Parliamentary accountability

One of the mechanisms, by which the executive is held to account by Parliament, is the questioning of civil servants by Parliamentary Select Committees (PSCs). The ultimate responsibility for the implementation of policy lies with the Minister. Giving evidence to PSCs is seen as a stepping-stone towards seniority in the civil service:

Civil servants questioned by Parliamentary Select Committee. Select committee performance important for progression and stuff. 

Margaret Hodge M.P., former Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, gave her view in 2016 that the old convention of civil servants being accountable to ministers, who are accountable in turn to Parliament, is “broken”.

> It worked when Haldane invented it after the First World War, when there were only 28 civil servants in the Home Office. Today, despite the cuts, there are 28,000.” She said that this system, combined with the high turnover among civil service officials as they move between policy areas, means that those who are responsible for waste or errors “rarely find themselves accountable”.
