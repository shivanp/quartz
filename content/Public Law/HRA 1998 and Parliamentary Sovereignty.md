## s 2 HRA 1998

Requires that any “court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must **take into account**” the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (in Strasbourg) “so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen”.

#### Mirror principle

In the early days, the UK courts took this as a strong direction. Lord Bingham developed the 'mirror principle' in [[R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator [2004] UKHL 26]]:
> 'The duty of national courts is to keep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less.'

#### Dialogue

But in recent years, courts have been bolder in arguing for a development of the law that preserves the autonomy of English law. This applies particularly in situations where jurisprudence from Strasbourg may be less relevant/ attuned to the nature and culture of the common law system. 

The idea is that there should be 'dialogue' between UK courts and the ECHR: each court can learn from the other. This approach has been taken in cases including [[R v Horncastle [2009] UKSC 14]] and [[R (Haney) v SoS for Justice [2014] UKSC 66]]. 

## s 3 HRA 1998

Most controversial provision in the HRA. States that
> '… so far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with convention rights.'

It applies a strong obligation on UK courts to strive to interpret existing legislation in an ECHR-compatible way. 

The issue is whether in practice, this gives the judiciary the ability to override the apparent intention of Parliament when it passed the original legislation. Concerns heightened after [[R v A (Complainant's Sexual History) [2002] 1 AC 45]]. 

Subsequent cases have confirmed this view, that in some circumstances it may be necessary for a s 3 interpretation to be made that **appears to conflict with parliamentary intention**. But courts stress that this is only appropriate where the interpretation does not go 'against the grain' of the underlying policy and scheme of the original legislation. 

This gives courts a powerful interpretive tool, which can be seen as going beyond modern forms of purposive statutory interpretation. In relation to the wider issue of sovereignty, there is a similar effect as under s 2 ECA 1972; the HRA has a higher status than an ordinary statute. 

 Even though the YJCEA in the R v A (CSH) case was passed subsequently to the HRA, this later Act was 'governed' by the terms of the dominant, 'constitutional statute'.
 
 ## s 4 HRA 1998
 
 > If a court is satisfied that a provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of incompatibility. 
 
Note that this is not a 'strike down' power; the declaration of incompatibility has a political rather than legal effect. It does not invalidate the law that has been deemed incompatible, just flags the incompatibility. 

s 3 and s 4 are effectively alternative powers that a court can utilise if incompatible legislation appears to have facilitated the violation of an ECHR right. 

When a declaration is made under s 4, this is seen as a significant intervention, and in most instances politicians take steps to remedy this. 

Notable example of s 4 powers: [[A & Others v Secretary of State for Home Dept [2004] UKHL 56]] (Belmarsh case), after which the government re-evaluated its anti-terrorism policies. 

Some have categorised s 4 as a mechanism which achieves an indirect form of constitutional review of legislation (in practical terms). 

## Accommodating sovereignty

The design of the HRA represents accommodation between stronger rights of protection and the need not undermine the traditional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. 

s 6(2) HRA gives a defence to public authorities to a claim that they have violated an individual's ECHR rights. This defence is that the authority was obliged/ allowed to violate an ECHR right because of the operation of incompatible legislation (which it has not been possible to make compatible using s 3 powers). So such violations are not automatically unlawful. 

## Ultimate effect of HRA

It is perfectly possible for Parliament to undo HRA 1998, and no longer be bound by it. But for as long as it remains in place, it will have a dominant effect as a 'constitutional statute'. Strongly arguable that the HRA does not fundamentally undermine the basic supremacy of Parliament as a continuing sovereign institution.
