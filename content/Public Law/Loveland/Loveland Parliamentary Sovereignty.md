Can think of 'laws' as a formal way in which 'democratic' societies express consent to their system of governance. US Constitution is an example of a society altering legal structures because people no longer consented to the existing form of government. 

A basic (though contentious) point in democratic theory: the more important a particular law is to the way society is governed, the more difficult it should be to change that law. The rationale is that it would be undesirable for fundamental laws to be vulnerable to reform which does not attract the 'consent' of the governed. 

Questions:
1. How much importance should be ascribed to particular values?
2. How much consent should one need to change those values?
3. How should that consent be expressed?

The US Constitution can only be amended with the consent of 2/3 of the members of the federal Congress and the legislatures of 3/4 of the 50 states. Prevents a tyranny of minorities and of small majorities.

Most law-making in the US takes place within the boundaries of consent outlined by the Constitution. Laws regarded as not essential to society's continued welfare can, by contrast, be changed with relative ease. 

## Pre-1688

Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration: 'inalienable rights'. English judges seemed to suggest there was a system of 'natural law' or 'divine law' which controlled the content of man-made law. 

Coke CJ in 1610: 
> “In many cases, the common law will control Acts of Parliament, and sometime adjudge them to be utterly void”

## Diceyan theory

Such natural law doctrines are no longer recognised. Unlike the Americans, fundamental constitutional values are not safeguarded by a complex amendment process. British Parliament is the sovereign law-maker. 

Specifically, this comes from a legal theory articulated in the 1880s by A V Dicey, in his textbook *An introduction to the study of the law of the constitution*. Enormous influence on British constitutional law. Some of the political views very of it's time. Parliamentary sovereignty has two parts: positive limb and negative limb. 

Limb | Description
---|---
Positive limb | Parliament can make or unmake any law whatsoever. If a majority of Commons, majority of Lords and monarch approve of a Bill, that Bill becomes an Act, irrespective of its contents. There are no legal limits on the substance of statute law. No distinction between ordinary and constitutional law. 
Negative limb | An Act's legal validity cannot be challenged in a court. An Act's substantive moral content is in legal terms irrelevant. 

The picture is not as clear as Diceyan theory would suggest. 

## Political source of Parliamentary sovereignty

17th Century was filled with bickering between the King, Commons and Lords over the extent of their respective powers. The courts switched their allegiance in these disputes, occasionally striking an independent line. 'Natural law' effectively made the judiciary the highest source of law in the English constitution. 

Since signing of Magna Carta in 13th Century, accepted that the King could not levy taxation without parliamentary approval. 

Triennial Act 1641: required the Monarch to summon Parliament at least once every three years. Charles II did not regard himself as obliged to obey its terms. 

1688 revolution: marked the crossing of a political watershed. A new political contract was struck between Parliament and the Monarchy, and a new constitutional foundation was laid. William of Orange and Mary accepted that Crown's ability to govern England through its prerogative powers would be severely limited. 

Laid out in the Bill of Rights 1689, which said things like the elections of members of Parliament ought to be free. These moral principles possessed a superior legal status to the Monarch's personal legal powers. It was accepted that common law was subordinate to legislation, in its legal authority. So royal prerogative and common law both assumed to be less important than statute. 

American Constitution 1789-91: sovereignty lay with the American people. English: assumed that sovereignty would rest with Parliament. The English Bill of Rights was not secured against attack by the national legislature in the same way as American namesake. 

England was a unitary, not federal state. So Parliament controlled all territorial boundaries and delegation of powers to the localities. Had the sovereignty of Parliament succeeded merely in transferring tyrannical authority into different hands?

## What is meant by Parliament

Parliament has three parts: Commons, Lords and the Monarch. All three parts have equal powers within the law-making process. 

17th Century political theorists sincerely believed that Parliament composed of these three bodies was the most effective way to secure laws accurately expressed in the national interest. Jefferson used a selective definition of 'the people' too. 

The objective was to create a balanced law-making process within a 'balanced' constitution. Statutes could not be produced which did not represent the interests of all three 'Estates of the Realm'. 

Also, recall the House of Commons was not then organised over party political lines. 

The doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty is perhaps the most significant of the unchanging principles.
