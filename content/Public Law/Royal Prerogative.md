## Overview
#### Introduction

The source of power that Tony Blair used to take Britain to war in 2003 was the prerogative power of the Crown. Only sought parliamentary approval for this action for political reasons. Similar with Syria intervention vote 2013. 

Dicey's prerogative definition:
> 'The residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority, which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the Crown … Every act which the executive government can lawfully do without the authority of an Act of Parliament is done in virtue of this prerogative.'
—AV Dicey, Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (1885)

The courts (administrative court and upwards) are the arbiters of the existence and extent of a claimed prerogative power. 

UK developed from absolutist monarchy to democratic constitutional monarchy.

> 'The King hath no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him'
> Case of Proclamations (1611) 12 Co Rep 74.

Prerogative power was at the heart of the Government's attempts in 2016 to trigger the Article 50 'Brexit' process without initial parliamentary approval, which led to the case of [[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5]], decided in the Supreme Court.

#### Development

The House of Lords decision in GCHQ significantly extended the reviewability of prerogative powers, and since that control has been tightened further. 

[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act April 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/contents) made provision for treaties to be ratified only after Parliament had the opportunity to raise opposing resolutions. But this is limited because only covers the process relating to approval of treaties, a very specific aspect of prerogative power. 

#### Position of the Crown

UK is a 'constitutional monarchy', i.e., a nation in which the monarch is the head of state but not the political head of government, and whose powers to govern are limited. In a gradual process from 1688 the powers to govern the UK effectively passed from the monarch to the Executive, with the Prime Minister at its head. 

The 'royal prerogative' refers to those powers of the Crown that are recognised by the common law, as distinct from those conferred and exercised under statute. So in this context, the 'Crown' refers to the executive, since it is highly unlikely that royal prerogative will be exercised in any other way than by the executive on behalf of the monarch, reflecting a strong constitutional convention. 

Say the Queen acts 'on the advice of' the Prime Minister. 

#### Control by statute and convention

The business of government is now largely conducted through statutory powers. In areas where prerogative retains significance (such as military action), how the power is actually used is governed by convention. 

## Ministerial prerogative powers

Ministerial prerogative powers are those relating to:
- The judicial system
- Foreign affairs
- Armed forces, war and times of emergency ('defence of the realm')

#### Prerogative of mercy

The Home Secretary (on behalf of the Crown) may pardon those convicted of criminal offences prosecuted by the Crown. Comes from Act of Settlement 1700

> “stop an impeachment … but there is to be nothing to prevent the king from pardoning after the impeached person has been convicted and sentenced”.

The prerogative of mercy is an example of a prerogative which the courts have willingly reviewed. 

[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley [1993] 4 All ER 442]] it was held:
> “The court had jurisdiction to review the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy by the Home Secretary in accord with accepted public law principles since the exercise of the prerogative was an important feature of the criminal justice system and a decision by the Home Secretary which was infected with legal errors ought not to be immune from legal challenge merely because it involved an element of policy or was made under the prerogative.”

#### Foreign affairs

Ministerial powers in this area include:
- Granting and revoking passports
- The recognition of other sovereign states and their representatives
- The making and ratification of treaties - seen as contracts between states, which generally does not require the approval of Parliament ([[Attorney General for Canada v Attorney General for Ontario [1937] AC 326]]). 
- The governance of British Overseas Territories. 

#### Armed forces and emergencies

The taking of measures necessary in times of emergency and/or for the 'defence of the realm' is a prerogative power. In [[Chandler v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 763]], Lord Reid stated:

> 'The disposition and armament of the armed forces are and for centuries have been within the exclusive discretion of the Crown …'

[[Burmah Oil Company (Burma Trading) Ltd. v Lord Advocate [1965] AC 75]]: 3-2 majority in the House of Lords held that compensation was payable to the company. No general rule that the prerogative could be exercised without compensation. 

## Monarch's prerogative

Some 'personal' prerogatives which were traditionally exercised by the Monarch still exist. Now exercised by the monarch 'on the advice of the Prime Minister'. Includes:
- The appointment and removal of minister
- The appointment of Prime Minister
- The right to assent to legislation
- The creation of peers and the granting of other honours
- The right to prorogue Parliament

## The Crown's legal prerogatives

Administration of justice was historically the prerogative of the monarch, regarded as the 'fountain of justice'. The structure of the courts and their jurisdiction are almost entirely statute-based. 

- There is a presumption that the Crown is not bound by statute, meaning that legislation will not apply to the Crown unless this has been explicitly stated. 
- In [[Province of Bombay v Municipal Corporation of the City Bombay [1947] AC 58]] the Privy Council reaffirmed and elaborated upon this principle
> 'If ... it is manifest from the very terms of the statute, that it was the intention of the legislature that the Crown should be bound, then the result is the same as if the Crown had been expressly named.'

There has been some debate recently about reversing this presumption, but it remains in place to maintain the clarity and certainty of the law on the point ([[R (Black) v SoS Justice [2017] UKSC 81]])

- Immunity from some litigation: Crown is not directly subject to the contempt jurisdiction (such as contempt from court)
- Sovereign has personal immunity from prosecution or being sued for a wrongful act.
