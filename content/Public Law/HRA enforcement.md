## s 6(2) HRA

s 6(1) makes it unlawful for public authorities to act in a way that is incompatible with a Convention right. But this is affected for s 6(2):

> [!statute] s 6(2) HRA 1998
> (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if—
> 
> (a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or
> 
> (b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.

Therefore, in cases where a person claims that a public authority has violated one or more of their ECHR rights, it may be possible for the public authority to rely upon what is sometimes referred to as the ‘statutory defence’ under s. 6(2), HRA.

#### Statutory defence

In [[R v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, ex parte Hooper [2005] UKHL 29]], Lord Hope provided the following guidance with respect to the defence under s. 6(2). 

Note that s. 6(2) was designed to ensure that the principle of parliamentary sovereignty was not undermined.
> 'The situation to which paragraph (a) is addressed arises where the effect of the primary legislation is that the authority has no alternative but to do what the legislation tells it to do. … The key to its application lies in the fact that the effect of this legislation, wherever it is found, is that a duty is imposed on the authority… As it is a duty which has been imposed on the authority by or as a result of primary legislation, Parliamentary sovereignty prevails over the Convention right. The defence is provided to prevent the legislation from being rendered unenforceable.
> 
> The situation to which paragraph (b) is addressed … arises where the authority has a discretion, which it has the power to exercise or not to exercise as it chooses, to give effect to or enforce provisions of or made under primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect to in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights…’

## s 3 HRA

A public authority’s reliance on the statutory defence in s. 6(2) does not necessarily mean that it will evade liability under the HRA. The defence is itself impacted by the courts’ duty contained in s. 3(1). 

> [!statute] s 3 HRA 1998
> (1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.
> 
> (2) This section—
> 
> (a) applies to primary legislation and subordinate legislation whenever enacted;
> 
> (b) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of any incompatible primary legislation; and
> 
> (c) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of any incompatible subordinate legislation if (disregarding any possibility of revocation) primary legislation prevents removal of the incompatibility.

If the court uses its s 3 power to read the provision compatibly, the public authority's potential s 6(2) defence will effectively disappear, meaning that it cannot avoid liability under s 6(1). This will then provide a remedy for the applicant. (Note that s 3 applies to legislation existing at the time of the enactment of the HRA 1998, as well as to future legislation). If the court is not able to use its s 3 power and instead makes a DOI under s 4, the claimant will not have a remedy, as the s 6(2) defence will remain in place.

#### Interpretation of legislation

Thus, s. 3(1) places the UK courts under a duty to interpret legislation in a Convention compatible way to the extent that this is 'possible'. Determining how 'far' the courts can go in any given situation is therefore a very significant consideration.

A court's use of s 3 interpretation will have the effect of removing the s. 6(2) defence from the Defendant. It is important to consider (over this element and the next) how the alternative courses open to a court – using either s 3 or s 4, where appropriate – will affect the final outcome of a case.

The constitutional significance of the courts’ approach to the scope and limit of the section 3 duty is exemplified by the case of [[R v A (Complainant's Sexual History) [2001] UKHL 25]].

Subsequent to the case of R v A, the courts grappled further with the full extent of their powers under s. 3. In [[Re S (Children) and Re W (Care Orders) [2002] UKHL 10]], the Court of Appeal undertook a radical reinterpretation of provisions of the Children Act 1989 concerning care plans for children. This was reversed, however, by the House of Lords, and the opinion of Lord Nicholls, who gave the lead judgment, provides some useful early guidance on the use of this new power:
> 'In applying section 3, courts must be ever mindful of this outer limit. The Human Rights Act reserves the amendment of primary legislation to Parliament … Interpretation of statutes is a matter for the courts; the enactment of statutes, and the amendment of statutes, are matters for Parliament … it is sufficient to say that a meaning which departs substantially from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament is likely to have crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment. This is especially so where the departure has important practical repercussions which the court is not equipped to evaluate.’

It seems, therefore, that where use of the interpretative power in s. 3 would bring about a major change in the law which would have far-reaching consequences, the courts will be less willing to use it.

A similar approach can be seen in the key case of [[Bellinger v Bellinger [2003] UKHL 21]].

In [[Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza [2004] UKHL 30]], the (majority of the) law lords felt able to use section 3 powers to read the statutory provision in a Convention-compatible way.

In finding that a broad approach to interpretation should apply with respect to s 3, the House of Lords held in Ghaidan that a court may be required to depart from the clear and unambiguous meaning that the provision would otherwise have borne. A court can interpret the language of provisions restrictively or expansively, and it can also read in words which change the ordinary meaning of the legislation.

However, the law lords indicated that the use of this interpretative power would go too far if it:
- changed the substance of the provisions completely
- ran counter to a fundamental feature of the legislation or to the underlying thrust or cardinal feature of it; in other words, if it went ‘against the grain’ of the original legislation
- contradicted provisions in the legislation
- repealed or deleted the language used in the legislation
- Involved the court making decisions for which it is not equipped

#### Subsequent case law

The approach in Ghaidan has been approved in subsequent cases.

In [[R (Wilkinson) v Inland Revenue Commissioners [2005] UKHL 30]] (para 17-18), Lord Hoffmann stated that, just as the principle of legality meant that statutes were construed against the background of human rights subsisting at common law, so now, s. 3 required them to be construed against the background of ECHR rights. He went on to say that, whilst there was a ‘strong presumption’ arising from the Convention rights, ‘the question is still one of interpretation’.

Referring to Ghaidan, Lord Hoffmann also said that, whilst the interpretative exercise in that case may have been contrary to the intention of the Parliament that passed the Rent Act 1977, the ‘intention of Parliament’ has a broader meaning. It encompasses ‘the interpretation which the reasonable reader would give to the statute read against its background, including, now, an assumption that it was not intended to be incompatible with Convention rights.’

The Supreme Court has largely continued to follow the same approach with respect to section 3. See, for example, the cases of [[Pinnock v Manchester City Council [2010] UKSC 45]], and [[Hounslow LBC v Powell [2011] UKSC 8]].

> [!summary]
> As s. 3 imposes a strong interpretative obligation, the courts CAN:
> - interpret a provision even if the language is clear
> - adopt a ‘linguistically strained’ interpretation
> - read down language (i.e., adopt a narrower meaning to render the provision ECHR- compatible)
> - read in words/ imply in provisions
> - and, as the interpretative obligation is a strong one, a declaration of incompatibility under s. 4, HRA should be a 'measure of last resort'.
> 
> However, there are limits to the courts’ s. 3 power, and so the courts CANNOT:
> - change the substance of the provision completely
> - make changes which run counter to a fundamental feature of the legislation or to the underlying thrust of it (going ‘against the grain’ of the legislation)
> - contradict provisions in the legislation
> - repeal or delete the language used in the legislation
> - Make decisions for which the court is not equipped

## s 4 HRA

The courts have no power to strike down primary legislation that is incompatible with ECHR rights, because of the key importance of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. However, in situations where the court does not consider it appropriate to adopt a ‘section 3 interpretation’ of relevant law, it may make a declaration that a particular provision is incompatible with an ECHR right. 

> [!statute] s 4 HRA 1998
> (1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.
> 
> (2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.
> 
> (3) Subsection (4) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of subordinate legislation, made in the exercise of a power conferred by primary legislation, is compatible with a Convention right.
> 
> (4) If the court is satisfied—
> - (a) that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, and
> - (b) that (disregarding any possibility of revocation) the primary legislation concerned prevents removal of the incompatibility,
> 
> it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.
> 
> (5) In this section “court” means—
> - (a) the Supreme Court;
> - (b) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council;
> - (c) the Court Martial Appeal Court ;
> - (d) in Scotland, the High Court of Justiciary sitting otherwise than as a trial court or the Court of Session;
> - (e) in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the High Court or the Court of Appeal.
> - (f) the Court of Protection, in any matter being dealt with by the President of the Family Division, the Chancellor of the High Court] or a puisne judge of the High Court.
> 
> (6) A declaration under this section (“a declaration of incompatibility”)—
> - (a) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it is given; and
> - (b) is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made.
In [[Bellinger v Bellinger [2003] UKHL 21]], the House of Lords made a declaration of incompatibility in respect of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, s. 11(c), as the fact that it made no provision for the recognition of gender reassignment made it incompatible with articles 8 and 12.

In [[A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56]] – the Belmarsh case – the House of Lords made a s. 4 declaration that s. 23 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 was incompatible with articles 5(1) and 14 of the ECHR.

The policy was found to be disproportionate, insofar as it was not strictly necessary to have detained suspected international terrorists without charge or trial, and it was also discriminatory on the ground of nationality or immigration status.

See too the earlier case of [[R (Anderson) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] UKHL 46]] where the House of Lords found that s. 29 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 was incompatible with article 6(1), ECHR. It provides a further example of the courts’ approach to the limits of s. 3, as well as the making of a declaration under s. 4.

## s 10: remedial action

> [!statute]
> (1) This section applies if—
> 
> (a) a provision of legislation has been declared under section 4 to be incompatible with a Convention right and, if an appeal lies—
> - (i) all persons who may appeal have stated in writing that they do not intend to do so;
> - (ii) the time for bringing an appeal has expired and no appeal has been brought within that time; or
> - (iii) an appeal brought within that time has been determined or abandoned; or
> 
> (b) it appears to a Minister of the Crown or Her Majesty in Council that, having regard to a finding of the European Court of Human Rights made after the coming into force of this section in proceedings against the United Kingdom, a provision of legislation is incompatible with an obligation of the United Kingdom arising from the Convention.
> 
> (2) If a Minister of the Crown considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section, he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility.
> 
> (3) If, in the case of subordinate legislation, a Minister of the Crown considers—
> 
> (a) that it is necessary to amend the primary legislation under which the subordinate legislation in question was made, in order to enable the incompatibility to be removed, and
> 
> (b) that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section,
> 
> he may by order make such amendments to the primary legislation as he considers necessary.
> 
> (4) This section also applies where the provision in question is in subordinate legislation and has been quashed, or declared invalid, by reason of incompatibility with a Convention right and the Minister proposes to proceed under paragraph 2(b) of Schedule 2.
> 
> (5) If the legislation is an Order in Council, the power conferred by subsection (2) or (3) is exercisable by Her Majesty in Council.
> 
> (6) In this section “legislation” does not include a Measure of the Church Assembly or of the General Synod of the Church of England.
> 
> (7) Schedule 2 makes further provision about remedial orders.

[Section 10(2), HRA 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/2) provides that, in response to a declaration of incompatibility made under s 4 (or to a decision of the ECtHR), the relevant ministers may take expedited 'remedial action' to amend the relevant legislation as necessary to remove the incompatibility, if 'there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section'.

Schedule 2 HRA 1998 sets out two procedures. One is the standard procedure, which requires that a draft amending order be laid before Parliament for 60 days before being approved by both Houses of Parliament. The second remedial procedure concerns urgent cases, where the order may be laid before Parliament for approval after it is made.

Note that the government may well plan a legislative response to a s 4 declaration over a longer period of time instead, if the expedited process under s 10 is not seen as necessary.

In the absence of a governmental response of any kind, the claimant may have recourse to the ECtHR, since all available domestic remedies will have been exhausted.

#### Declarations and remedial action

The Ministry of Justice produces an [annual report]([https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/944857/responding-to-human-rights-judgments-2020_pdf.pdf](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/944857/responding-to-human-rights-judgments-2020_pdf.pdf)): ‘Responding to human rights judgments, Report to the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the Government’s response to human rights judgments.’ This includes details of declarations of incompatibility (“DOI”) that have been made by the courts in that year. It also includes a list of all of the declarations that have been made since the HRA came into force in October 2000, with details of what, if any, remedial action has been taken by the UK government and Parliament with respect to each declaration.

The report indicates that until the end of July 2021, 44 DOIs have been made by the courts since October 2000. One DOI was made in the period covered by the 2020-21 report, in the Northern Irish case of ‘JR111’ [[Re Application for Judicial Review [2021] NIQB 48]]. The court held that the requirement in the Gender Recognition Act 2004 for trans people to show that they had suffered from a ‘disorder’ (gender dysphoria) in order.

## s 19

It is worth noting the role that the HRA plays in the formation of prospective, new law, as well as the obligations and powers that arise for public authorities and the courts with respect to existing law.

> [!statute] s 19 HRA 1998
> 
> (1) A Minister of the Crown in charge of a Bill in either House of Parliament must, before Second Reading of the Bill—
> 
> (a) make a statement to the effect that in his view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention rights (“a statement of compatibility”); or
> 
> (b) make a statement to the effect that although he is unable to make a statement of compatibility the government nevertheless wishes the House to proceed with the Bill.
> 
> (2) The statement must be in writing and be published in such manner as the Minister making it considers appropriate.

Section 19(1) provides that, prior to the second reading of a bill in Parliament, the minister responsible for that bill must make a written statement that:

(a) the proposed new legislation is compatible with the Convention rights (‘a statement of compatibility'); or

(b) although he is unable to make a statement of compatibility, the government wishes to proceed with the bill regardless.

A statement of compatibility was made in relation to the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Although a derogation was entered in respect of article 5(1), the statement declared that, in all other respects, the Act was Convention-compliant. This statement turned out to be incorrect, as confirmed in the case of [[A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 56]] where the House of Lords held that the power to detain foreign nationals. 

## s 8 (remedies)

Section 8 covers the provision of remedies.

> [!statute] s 8 HRA 1998
> (1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.
> 
> (2) But damages may be awarded only by a court which has power to award damages, or to order the payment of compensation, in civil proceedings.
> 
> (3) No award of damages is to be made unless, taking account of all the circumstances of the case, including—
> 
> (a) any other relief or remedy granted, or order made, in relation to the act in question (by that or any other court), and
> 
> (b) the consequences of any decision (of that or any other court) in respect of that act,
> 
> the court is satisfied that the award is necessary to afford just satisfaction to the person in whose favour it is made.
> 
> (4) In determining—
> 
> (a) whether to award damages, or
> 
> (b) the amount of an award,
> 
> the court must take into account the principles applied by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the award of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention.
> 
> (5) A public authority against which damages are awarded is to be treated—
> 
> (a) in Scotland, for the purposes of section 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1940 as if the award were made in an action of damages in which the authority has been found liable in respect of loss or damage to the person to whom the award is made;
> 
> (b) for the purposes of the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 as liable in respect of damage suffered by the person to whom the award is made.
> 
> (6) In this section—
> - “court” includes a tribunal;
> - “damages” means damages for an unlawful act of a public authority; and
> - “unlawful” means unlawful under section 6(1).
