The [Ministerial Code](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/826920/August-2019-MINISTERIAL-CODE-FINAL-FORMATTED-2.pdf) is a new development, reflects impetus towards transparency and accountability. 

Constitutional principle of responsible govt has been governed by conventions. Written guidelines used to be in the form of confidential 'Questions of Procedure for Ministers'. First published 1997. 

7 principles of public life:
- Selflessness
- Integrity
- Objectivity
- Accountability
- Openness
- Honesty
- Leadership

Code is a formal, published document, so more tangible than twin conventions. Also represents an unenforceable set of rules; 'soft law'. 

Covers:
- Principle of collective responsibility
- Proper and transparent engagement with Parliament
- Avoiding conflicts of interest
- Proper use of govt resources

Applies to govt ministers (in full), parliamentary private secretaries and special advisers (some parts only). 

Ministerial code usually updated when new PM takes office. BoJo made it Brexity.

#### Collective responsibility

The Ministerial code codifies this older principle of Govt. General principle: ministers should be able to express views frankly in expectation that they can argue freely in private while maintaining a united front when decisions have been reached. Requires privacy of opinions to be maintained. 

General principle 2.1 of the Code:

> The principle of collective responsibility requires that Ministers should be able to express their views frankly in the expectation that they can argue freely in private while maintaining a united front when decisions have been reached. This in turn requires that the privacy of opinions expressed in Cabinet and Ministerial Committees, including in correspondence, should be maintained.

#### Engagement with Parliament

s 9: specific detail on ministers' relations with Parliament. 

s 9.1:
> When Parliament is in session, most important announcements of Government policy should be made in the first instance in Parliament

> [!example]
> Esther McVey, MP, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, told Parliament in July 2018 that the National Audit Office (NAO) – the body which scrutinises public spending for Parliament – wanted Universal Credit (a new and highly controversial social security payment system) to be **"rolled out faster".**
> 
> The head of the NAO stated that this was incorrect, as the body had ongoing reservations about Universal Credit.
> 
> McVey told MPs that she had meant to say the NAO believed there was "no practical alternative" to continuing with the development of Universal Credit, which rolled six social security benefits into one.
> 
> **The consequences**
> 
> The head of the NAO took the unusual step of writing to McVey to take issue with how she responded to its report on Universal Credit.
> 
> There were calls for McVey's resignation, for deliberately misleading Parliament.
> 
> She apologised in Parliament for "inadvertently misleading“ it.
> 
> She subsequently resigned from Cabinet for unrelated reasons. (She re-joined Cabinet in a different role for 6 months before being ‘reshuffled’ off the front bench.)

#### Conflict of interest

> General principle 7:
> 
> “Ministers must ensure that no conflict of interest arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise”.
> 
> “Ministers should not accept a gift or hospitality which might, or might reasonably appear to, compromise their judgement or place them under an improper obligation”.

> [!example]
> 
> **Priti Patel MP** was forced to resign from Theresa May’s government in November 2017. As International Development Secretary, she had conducted unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers and business representatives.
> 
> In her response to Patel's resignation letter, the Prime Minister wrote that the UK and Israel were close allies and should work closely together. “But that must be done formally, and through official channels […] it is right that you have decided to resign and adhere to the high standards of transparency and openness that you have advocated.”
> 
> This incident clearly also had implications in terms of collective ministerial responsibility.
> 
> **The consequences**
> 
> In the next government under Boris Johnson, Priti Patel was appointed Home Secretary.
> 
> She was again accused of having breached the Ministerial Code prior to this appointment, for doing paid strategic consulting work for a private company without seeking approval from the advisory committee on business appointments as required by the Code.
> 
> The Prime Minister took no action.
#### Behaviour

General principle 1.2:

> “Ministers should be professional in all their dealings and treat all those with whom they come into contact with consideration and respect. Working relationships, including with civil servants, ministerial and parliamentary colleagues and parliamentary staff should be proper and appropriate. Harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the Ministerial Code and will not be tolerated”.

> [!example]
> 
> **Michael Fallon MP, Defence Secretary** resigned from the May government following allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour. This was against the background of allegations of a harassment and bullying culture in Parliament generally.
> 
> In his resignation letter to the prime minister, Fallon wrote:
> 
> “A number of allegations have surfaced about MPs in recent days, including some about my previous conduct. Many of these have been false, but I accept in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the armed forces that I have the honour to represent.
> 
> I have reflected on my position, and I am now resigning as Defence Secretary."
> 
> **The consequences**
> 
> Fallon resigned from Cabinet and remained a Member of Parliament until 2019.
