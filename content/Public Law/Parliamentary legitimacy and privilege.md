## Parliamentary legitimacy

Based on the idea of democratic mandate, so Parliament is accountable to the people. 

MPs democratically elected. Most MPs part of major political parties in first past the post system. 

MPs conduct outside the chamber has impact on perceived legitimacy of Parliament. 

#### Criminal Offences

- MP arrested on suspicion of criminal offence need not inform Speaker, so long as attendance in Parliament not affected
- MP convicted but released on bail: judge does not need to inform speaker
- Convicted and sentences: judge/ magistrate will inform Speaker in a letter
- MP sentenced for over a year: disqualified from sitting and voting in Commons or its committees

#### Code of Conduct

Code applies to members in all aspects of their public life, but not purely personal or private life. 

First Rule of Conduct: 
>Members shall base their conduct on a consideration of the public interest, avoid conflict between personal interest and the public interest, and resolve any conflict between the two, at once, and in favour of the public interest. 

Breaches are investigated by Parliamentary Committee on Standards, could result in expulsion from the House. 

#### Expulsion from the House

Motion moved, usually by Leader of the House. Generally reserved for serious crimes, perjury, fraud, and corruption. 
> [!example]
> 
> In 1976, John Stonehouse, Labour MP for Walsall South, was expelled from the House after serious financial problems caused him to flee the UK on a deceased constituent's passport. In Miami, he faked his own suicide by drowning, leaving his clothes on the beach. He was caught by the police in December 1975 and sent to Brixton prison in London, from where he continued to serve as an MP for several months.
Committee on Standards has no power to expel an MP, but recommendations likely to be followed. 

#### Expenses Scandal 2009
- Floating duck house, Sir Peter Viggers
- Second homes claims but then being rented out
- Criminal charges for false accounting brought against four parliamentarians, all imprisoned
- Voluntary repayments of ~£500,000 made

Led to creation of:

#### Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA)

Responsible for regulation and payment of expenses to Members of Commons. Business costs and expenses of each MP now publicly available. 

MPs also required to declare financial interests in Register of Members' Financial Interests, to ensure transparency about any interests which “others might reasonably consider to influence his or her actions or words as a Member of Parliament”.

#### Parliamentary Committee on Standards

Remit is to 
- Oversee work of Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
- Examine arrangements for Register of Members' Financial Interests
- Matters relating to conduct of Members
- Recommend modifications to Code of Conduct

#### Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards

Role is 
- Advisory
- Investigate allegations of MPs breaking Code of Conduct
- Decide complaints from parliamentary community about harassment, bullying or sexual harassment
- MPs Code of Conduct under review
- Keep Register of Members' Financial Interests

But cannot investigate ministers conduct in relation to ministerial role, or members of House of Lords. Cannot investigate constituents' complaints about MPs. MP expenses complaints dealt with by IPSA, not Commissioner for Standards. 

#### Powers of Parliamentary Committee on Standards

First Commissioner decides. Then Committee investigates and may agree with Commissioner or not. Have powers to 
- Order specific papers and records
- Order attendance of any MP
- Decide whether to hear evidence in public or private.

If breach is proved, Committee may 
- Produce an adverse report on the MP concerned
- Recommend MP apologise
- Recommend suspension from House for specified number of sitting days (during which MP receives no salary and cannot be on premises)
- Recommend expulsion from House

#### Lords misconduct

Similarly, $\exists$ Code of Conduct for members of the House of Lords. Enforced by House of Lords Commissioner for Standards. 

Matters in the remit of investigation of Commissioner:
- Failure to register relevant interests
- Breach of rules on financial inducements

Matters outside remit:
- Policy matters/ views
- Members' non-parliamentary activities
- Members' conduct in ministerial capacity
- Imprisonment for over a year gets you kicked out of Lords

Sanctions:
- Suspension from House
- Denial of access to financial support
- Expulsion

## Parliamentary privilege

Refers to freedoms and protections that both Houses require in order to function effectively. These include:
- Right of each House to control its own proceedings and precincts
- Right of those participating in parliamentary proceedings to speak freely without fear of legal liability
	- Article 9 of Bill of Rights 1689:
	> Proceedings in parliament not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place outside of Parliament
	- MP can make what would otherwise be counted as defamatory comments during a debate in the House, without risk of legal liability.

#### “Proceedings in Parliament”

The meaning of this has been subject to judicial consideration. General principle: courts cannot allow any challenge to what is said or done within the walls of Parliament, in respect to performance of its legislative functions and protection of established privileges. But courts will not allow misuse of this privilege. 

[[R v Chaytor & Ors [2010] UKSC 52]]: expenses claims by MPs do not qualify for the protection of privilege. This would have otherwise allowed them to avoid a trial for false accounting. 

#### Freedom from arrest

Members of both Houses cannot be arrested without order or sentence of the House, **except** on a criminal charge or criminal contempt of court. 

There remain today very few arrestable civil offences. The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege has recommended that members' freedom from arrest in civil cases should be abolished. Practical application: exempts members from summons as a witness in court.
