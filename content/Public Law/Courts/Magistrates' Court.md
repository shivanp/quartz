- Lowest level court in the **criminal** hierarchy. Virtually all cases start in the Magistrates' Court, and around 95% end there.
- Tries all summary (minor) offences, and some triable either way (mid-range) offences
- Power to impose fine of Â£5000, and/ or 6 month prison sentence for single offence
- Can commit defendant to the [[Crown Court]] either for sentence or trial. This will be either because they do not have the power to impose a higher sentence, or because the offence is one triable either way and a Crown Court trial is more appropriate. 
- The Magistrates' Court does not create precedent, but is bound by the Administrative Court, [[Court of Appeal]] and Supreme Court.
