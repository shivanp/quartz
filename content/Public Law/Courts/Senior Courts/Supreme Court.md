The Supreme Court is at the apex of the legal system of the United Kingdom. It hears appeals from courts in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on the most significant cases.

It was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 to replace the old Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. However, it did not start sitting until October 2009.

There are twelve Supreme Court judges, known as 'Justices'. They are known as "Lord/Lady [surname]". The full Court sits when the most important cases, usually those of constitutional significance, are heard. The senior judge is known as the President.

Permission to appeal to the Supreme Court is required and will only be granted if the issue raised is of 'general public importance'. Recent issues include:

- The availability of damages for the payment of commercial surrogacy fees
- The lawfulness of prorogation of Parliament by the Prime Minister
- Whether the applicable standard of proof in inquest proceedings in the case of suicide is the civil or the criminal standard

**Civil appeals**

It should be noted that, in cases of high importance, which are very likely in any event to reach the Supreme Court, it is possible for the case to by-pass the Court of Appeal. This clearly saves time and legal costs.

The procedure is known as a ‘leapfrog appeal’ and means that the judgment of the High Court is appealed directly to the Supreme Court. This was provided for by sections 12-16 of the Administration of Justice Act 1969 in relation to the House of Lords, and it has since been confirmed that the practice also applies to the Supreme Court.
