Special judicial bodies dealing with administrative and regulatory cases. No jurisdiction in criminal matters. 

## Tribunals

System created by [Tribunal, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/15/contents), which consolidated the previous system.

#### First Tier Tribunal

	- Social Entitlement Chamber (social security disputes)
	- Health, Education and Social Care Chamber
	- General Regulatory Chamber
	- Tax Chamber
	- Immigration and Asylum Chamber
	* Property Chamber
- Employment Tribunal is also 'first tier' level but is not a 'Chamber' of the First Tier Tribunal
- The Chambers hear **appeals from citizens against decisions made by Govt. departments or agencies** (except Property Chamber and Employment Chamber, where proceedings are on a private law basis)

#### Upper Tribunal

- Senior court
- Upper Tribunal Chambers hear appeals from First Tier Tribunal
- Four Chambers
	- Administrative Appeals Chamber
	- Tax and Chancery Chamber
	- Immigration and Asylum Chamber

## Coroner's Courts

Investigate all deaths where cause is unknown, and there is reason to suggest it was not due to natural causes. Investigations known as 'inquests'. Not as formal as court hearings, but can still be lawyer representations and examinations of witnesses. 

Juries in some cases, particularly when the deceased died in state custody. 

Coroners require legal experience but are not considered members of the judiciary – they are barristers/ solicitors/ medical professionals of not less than five years standing, who have a day job when not sitting as coroners. Decision is called 'verdict'.

## Public inquiries

Major investigations convened by Govt departments and given special statutory powers to compel testimony and the release of other forms of evidence. Only justification required for holding one is the existence of 'public concern'.

Recent inquiries include those into the Grenfell disaster, undercover policing, and the UK's role in the Iraq War. 

Inquiries Act 2005 – if a public inquiry is held under this Act, the inquiry has:
- Legal power to compel witnesses to give evidence.
- Legal safeguards and procedures.
- Statutory framework for appointment of chair and other personnel, the taking of evidence and production of a report and recommendations.

Nothing compelling Govt to act on the recommendations of a statutory public inquiry. 

Other areas: town and country planning decisions of public importance take place following public inquiries under separate legislation (e.g., big planning permission decisions). Members of the public can appear as third parties.
