## Introduction

The third ground of judicial review identified by Lord Diplock in **_GCHQ_** was procedural impropriety. This concerns a public decision-maker’s failure to follow correct statutory procedure and/or to act fairly in a more general sense, as measured against common law standards.

So, procedural impropriety as a concept covers two areas, the second having by far the wider scope:
1.  Failure to observe procedural statutory rules
2.  Duty to act fairly (common law fairness)

## Failure to observe procedural statutory rules

This type of error is essentially an extension of the basic principle of *ultra vires*, and it is therefore closely related to the ground of illegality. It requires public bodies to follow requirements of a procedural nature that have been laid down in statute. It is sometimes called ‘procedural ultra vires’.

#### Historic approach

The courts’ approach to assessing the breach of a procedural statutory rule used to involve a distinction between mandatory procedural requirements and directory procedural requirements.

Breach of a mandatory requirement would invalidate a decision, whereas failure to comply with a directory (or discretionary) requirement would not automatically invalidate a decision.

For example, in [[Agricultural, Horticultural and Forestry Industry Training Board v Aylesbury Mushrooms Ltd [1972] All ER 280]], the court held that an order issued by the Training Board was not binding upon the company because it had not been consulted, as required by a statutory provision which was expressed in mandatory terms.

#### Modern approach

More recently, the difficulties that can arise in determining whether a statutory requirement is mandatory or discretionary, particularly when there are several inter-linked requirements, have led the courts to move towards a more flexible approach.

Following a series of cases, which culminated in the decision of the House of Lords in [[R v Soneji [2006] 1 AC 34]], the judiciary now focus on the **consequences of the non-compliance**, and ask whether, in the light of those consequences, **Parliament could have intended** that the outcome of that non-compliance should be the **invalidity** of the decision.

R v Soneji was a case on procedural requirements for criminal cases, but the test has been applied by the Court of Appeal in administrative law cases:

- [[JN (Cameroon) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 307]]
- [[R (Herron) v The Parking Adjudicator [2011] EWCA Civ 905]]
- [[R v Guraj [2016] UKSC 65]]

## Duty to act fairly

In all cases, a decision-maker must act in accordance with the principles of ‘natural justice’, now known as the duty to act fairly. There are two central common law rules concerning the duty to act fairly.

## The right to be heard

> ‘*Audi alteram partem*’
> Literally: ‘the other side must be heard’. 

This means that a person affected by a public law decision should be given the opportunity to present their case.

The courts consider:
1. whether a duty has arisen
2. what level of duty is owed by the public authority
3. the content of the duty and whether there is a breach.

#### When does a duty arise

 Historically, the courts adopted a narrow approach whereby ‘judicial’ decisions were subject to the principles of natural justice, but ‘administrative’ decisions were not.

[[Ridge v Baldwin [1964] AC 40]] was a turning point, as the court held that it did not matter whether the decision was judicial or administrative. The question for the court should be the extent of the justice/ fairness required in a given situation.

##### When might the duty not apply

Professor De Smith pointed to certain situations where the courts have appeared to override the duty or have significantly modified it:
1. Where there are overriding concerns relating to issues of national security: See [[Council for the Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374]] (GCHQ), where it was held that the duty to consult the trade union was overridden by national security concerns. (Note that this is a legitimate expectation case).
2. In emergency cases, where public safety demands urgent actions ([[R v Secretary of State Transport, ex parte Pegasus Holdings Ltd [1989] 2 All ER 481]])
3. Rationing of resources cases: the courts frequently find that authorities cannot be expected to put forward a detailed case ([[R v Cambridge District Health Authority, ex parte B [1995] 1 WLR 898]]) where it was found it was not unfair for the authority not to give detailed reasons why it would not fund expensive cancer treatment for a child patient.
4. Cases where a person has waived their right to fairness ([[Lloyd v McMahon [1987] AC 625]]).

#### Level of fairness owed

Upon establishing that the duty to act fairly applies, the court will assess the level of fairness owed by the authority to the applicant. This will vary depending on the decision and the context of the issues. An early case in which the Privy Council gave guidance on the contextual nature of the question is [[Durayappah v Fernando [1967] 2 AC 337]].

A more modern approach to the courts’ assessment of the level of fairness was provided by Lord Bridge in [[Lloyd v McMahon [1987] AC 625]]. He stated that:

> '… the so-called rules of natural justice are not engraved on tablets of stone. To use the phrase which better expresses the underlying concept, what the requirements of fairness demand when any body, domestic, administrative or judicial, has to make a decision, which will affect the rights of individuals, depends on the character of the decision-making body, the kind of question it has to make and the statutory or other framework in which it operates.’

For a similar approach, see Lord Mustill in [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1993] 3 WLR 154]]. 

##### Licensing cases

Licensing cases provide an instructive example of the courts’ approach to the level of fairness question. For instance, on being refused a licence, does an applicant have the right to a hearing, enabling them to know why they have been turned down and giving them the opportunity to present counterarguments?

When considering the appropriate level of fairness, the courts have developed a spectrum approach.

Key case: [[McInnes v Onslow-Fane [1978] 1 WLR 1520]].

[[R v Gaming Board for Great Britain, ex parte Benaim & Khaida [1970] 2 QB 417]] concerned an application for a certificate of consent to apply for a gaming licence under the Gaming Act 1968. The application was rejected, and the applicants argued that they had a right to know the case against them, including the reasons for the rejection. Lord Denning held that:
> ‘…the board ought in every case be able to give to the applicant sufficient indication of the objections raised against him such as to enable him to answer them. That is only fair. And the board must at all costs be fair…’

In this case then, even though the applicants were mere applicants, as in McInnes, the court found that the Gaming Board should at least have provided a **gist of its reasons** for refusing the application. This apparent inconsistency between the two cases could be explained by the different contexts. In Benaim, the Board was deciding a defined issue under statute, whereas in McInnes the situation was more general, and the Board was exercising a very broad discretion.

#### Components

The 'right to be heard' is a broad, umbrella term – what the claimant may have wanted by way of fairness will clearly vary according to the particular context of the decision in question. However, five broad elements have tended to become the focus of such challenges. These are as follows:
1. Notice of the case against a person
2. Right to make representations
3. Witnesses
4. Legal representation
5. Reasons

#### Notice of the case against a person

The most basic element of procedural fairness is the right for a person to have notice of the case against or involving them. A failure to inform a person of the evidence against them, or of a decision taken that affects their interests, will mean that that person is unable to make any effective representations in response.

Sedley LJ emphasised in [[R v Governing Body of Dunraven School, ex parte B [2000] BLGR 494]] that what fairness demands will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case.

This basic issue of lack of notice of the case against a person can be exemplified by judgments in the following cases:
- In [[Errington v Minister of Health [1935] 1 KB 249]], the Court of Appeal held that there had been a breach of ‘natural justice’, because the minister had in effect heard evidence from one side without the other side being present.
- In [[R v Chief Constable of North Wales Police, ex parte Thorpe [1998] 3 WLR 57 (CA)]], the court held that a failure to disclose the full case against the applicants did not render the decisions unlawful because full notice would not have made a material difference.

Procedurally, it is important that once a person has been informed of the case against them, they are then given a reasonable amount of time in which to respond, prior to the actual decision being made.

In [[R v Thames Magistrates, ex parte Polemis [1974] 1 WLR 1371]], a ship's master was summoned to answer a charge under the Control of Pollution Act 1971. He was required to attend the magistrates' court on the same afternoon to answer the charges. He was convicted, but this was subsequently quashed due to unfairness.

In [[Bank Mellat v HM Treasury (No 2) [2013] UKSC 39]] argued that the significance of proper notice, and therefore of allowing affected parties the opportunity to make representations and to take part in consultation, was important in upholding the principle of good administration. Public decision-making was less likely to be effective, as well as transparent and fair, if relevant parties did not have such an opportunity.

#### Right to make representations

Another key issue is whether a person should be given the right to make representations as part of the decision-making process. Whether it is fair for these representations to be confined to written form, or to involve an oral hearing, will depend on the nature of the decision and the process itself.

It is important to note that there is not an automatic, common law duty to hold personal or oral hearings. There have been several cases where the lack of a hearing has been held not to have affected the fairness of a decision, as for instance in [[Lloyd v McMahon [1987] AC 625]].

Further cases:
- [[R v Army Board of the Defence Council, ex parte Anderson [1992] 1 QB 169]]
- [[R (Smith and West) v Parole Board [2005] UKHL 1]]
- [[Osborn v. Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61]]
- [[R (Bourgass) v Secretary of State for Justice [2015] UKSC 54]]

##### Multi-stage procedures

It is quite common for public bodies to follow procedures that deal with issues in stages. For example, an initial investigation, or prima facie assessment, may be followed by a decision at a later stage. This raises the question: if it is appropriate to have a hearing, when should this take place?

The tendency of the Administrative courts in these situations is to conclude that there is no right to be heard in the initial stages, the rationale being that there will usually be a right to be heard at some later stage in the process. Simply put, if there is a fair hearing at some appropriate point, the courts may regard this as sufficient, even though the applicant may feel that they are being granted the wrong type of hearing at the wrong time. See [[Wiseman v Borneman [1971] AC 297]].

#### Witnesses

As with hearings, there is not an automatic common law duty to call witnesses in a case. However, the duty to act fairly may in some circumstances be infringed if a person is not allowed to call witnesses, or to cross-examine witnesses appearing against them. This will depend on what is at stake for the individuals, the nature of the decision-making body and proceedings in question, and on whether the court feels that a 'legalistic' procedure is appropriate.

See [[R v Hull Prison Board of Visitors, ex parte St Germain [1979] 1 WLR 1401]] in which prisoners, charged with breaches of prison discipline during riots, were entitled to have alibi witnesses give evidence because of the serious punishment that could be imposed by the disciplinary process (notably loss of remission).

#### Legal representation

There is no general right at common law to be legally represented, and it can be seen to be counter-productive: [[R v Board of Visitors of HM Prison, the Maze, ex parte Hone [1988] 1 AC 379]].

Case law suggests that, where the rules of the public body in question do not specifically exclude legal representation, the body has discretion to decide whether or not to allow it.

In [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Tarrant [1985] QB 251]], the court suggested a number of factors that ought to be considered when considering the right to legal representation. These included: 
- the seriousness of the charge; 
- the likelihood that a point of law may arise; 
- the ability of the person (a prisoner in this case) to conduct his own case; and, 
- the need for a speedy process.

#### Reasons

An applicant may argue that a decision should be quashed not because of some procedural defect (such as not knowing the case against them or being denied an oral hearing), but because they were not given reasons for the decision taken.

A duty to give reasons may be imposed by statute. Such a duty is imposed, for instance, by the [Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/53/contents) on all tribunals listed in [Schedule 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/53/schedule/1) of the Act.

As with other areas of the right to be heard, there is no clear common law duty to give reasons for a decision. This was confirmed in [[R (Hasan) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [2008] EWCA Civ 1312]].

##### Trend

However, there appears to be a notable trend towards the desirability of giving reasons for administrative decisions, as part of the general attempt by the courts to promote the values of accountability and ‘good administration’ in public life. In particular, where a fundamental interest is a stake, fairness would seem to require reasons to be given.

In the leading case of [[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1993] 3 WLR 154]], Lord Mustill acknowledged that ‘the law does not at present recognise a general duty to give reasons for an administrative decision’. He went on to say that in some circumstances a duty may be implied (and he endorsed the approach of the Court of Appeal in [[Reg. v. Civil Service Appeal Board, ex parte Cunningham [1991] 4 All ER 310]]).

In [[R v Ministry of Defence, ex parte Murray [1998] COD 134]], relating to a court-martial, the court provided a summary of the considerations and principles affecting the need to give reasons. For example, the absence of any right of appeal and the useful role that giving reasons can play in highlighting errors were seen as positive factors in support of the need for reasons.

##### Onerousness

The duty to give reasons may not be necessary in circumstances where it would be unduly onerous for a body to do so, because of the complexity of the decision or the range of factors that have to be considered. Thus, in [[R v Higher Education Funding Council, ex parte Institute of Dental Surgery [1994] 1 WLR 242]], reasons were not required to be given for the refusal to give research grant funding to the Institute.

In some situations, the court may instead decide that the duty of fairness only requires that a general overview of the reasons for the decision be given (the ‘gist’). See [[R v Home Secretary, ex parte Al Fayed [1997] 1 All ER 228]].

##### Article 6 ECHR

As with other areas falling under the umbrella term of the right to be heard, Article 6 of the ECHR has impacted upon cases concerning fairness and reasons.

[[Stefan v General Medical Council [1999] 1 WLR 1293]] is illuminative of the courts’ evolving approach to this aspect of procedural fairness. In his judgment, Lord Clyde stated that cases where reasons are not required are becoming exceptions rather than examples of the norm.

A further indication, that the courts are moving towards a reversal of the traditional assumption about the need to give reasons in public law decision-making, was shown in [[Oakley v South Cambridgeshire District Council [2017] EWCA Civ 71]].


## The rule against bias
> '*Nemo iudex in causa sua*'
> Literally: ‘no-one should be a judge in their own cause’.

The courts will consider the context of a case and determine if there has been direct or indirect bias. Decision-makers cannot be deemed to act fairly if there is a risk that they may be biased. As Lord Hewart CJ stated in [[R v Sussex County Council, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256]]:
> ‘…justice should not only be done but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done’.

The rule against bias disqualifies such a person from deciding a matter and will lead to the quashing of any decision so made. A distinction can be made between direct and indirect bias.

#### Direct bias
Interests have largely been confined to financial interests such as pecuniary interests on the part of the decision-maker. The idea is that one should not be a judge in one’s own cause.

The following key principles have been established by the courts:
- The extent of the interest is irrelevant (so long as it is not too remote), as is the extent of the decision-maker’s knowledge.
- If a decision is made by a group of individuals, e.g. a local authority or committee, a pecuniary interest on the part of one member will be enough to engage the prospect of direct bias.
- Note that there does not need to be actual bias. A direct pecuniary interest is sufficient.

Direct bias will invalidate the decision. This is sometimes referred to as **‘automatic disqualification’.**

See [[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal (1852) 3 HL Cas 759]].

##### *Pinochet*

In this saga, a non-financial personal interest was found to amount to direct bias.

In [[R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Court, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 1) [2000] 1 AC 61]] it was found that the Chilean Senator Pinochet could be extradited to Spain on an international warrant.

Pinochet’s legal team then discovered that one of the law lords in the majority, Lord Hoffmann, was a Director of Amnesty International’s charitable arm and that his wife had worked for its International Secretariat. This was relevant because Amnesty International had been given permission to ‘intervene’ in the case and had made submissions.

In [[R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Court, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) [2000] 1 AC 119]] a new panel of the House of Lords set aside the earlier decision on the ground that Lord Hoffmann was automatically disqualified. 

In [[Helow v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 62]], Lord Mance cited Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s formulation in Pinochet. He emphasised that mere membership of an organisation would not satisfy the principle in Pinochet. A judge would have to be actively involved in the organisation and that organisation would have to have been a party to the impugned proceedings in order for the principle to apply.

It should be noted that in [[Bovis Homes Ltd v New Forest District Council [2002] EWHC 483 (Admin)]], Ouseley J took the view that the rule in Pinochet only applies to people exercising judicial functions and not to members of a local authority.

#### Indirect bias

In cases where the decision-maker does not have a direct interest, the assessment of bias will depend upon the particular circumstances of the case.

The law is now governed by the key decision in [[Porter v Magill [2002] 2 AC 357 (HL)]] which superseded the old test from the case of [[R v Gough [1993] 2 All ER 724]].
> [!test] Test: Indirect bias
> The test in [[Porter v Magill [2002] 2 AC 357 (HL)]] was set down by Lord Hope, who stated:
> > ‘The question is whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased’.
> 
> This rule applies equally to all public decision-making bodies, and not just tribunals.
##### Questioning distinction

More recently, in [[R (Kaur) v Institute of Legal Executives Appeal Tribunal [2011] EWCA Civ 1168]], Rix LJ expressed scepticism about treating the principles in Pinochet and Porter v Magill as separate doctrines.

He drew on Lord Hope's observation in [[Meerabux v Attorney-General of Belize [2005] 2 AC 513]] that it is likely that the law lords in Pinochet would have applied the test in Porter v Magill, had it been available at the time, rather than appearing to extend the remit of direct bias.

Rix LJ (in Kaur) thought that it was possible to see Pinochet as a strand of the doctrine in Porter v Magill involving indirect bias.

## Examples of bias

#### Unauthorised participation or presence

Participation in a decision, or mere presence when the decision is taken, by someone who may be biased (even if they are not a member of the decision-making body), may invalidate a decision.

In [[R v Barnsley MBC, ex parte Hook [1976] 3 All ER 452]], a decision taken by a local authority committee to revoke a trader’s market licence, because he had urinated in the street, was quashed. This was in part because the market manager, who had reported the matter to the committee, was present when the decision was made.

The rule against bias has been strengthened with the development of human rights case law in the UK. In [[R (Beeson) v Dorset County Council [2003] HRLR 11]] a question was raised regarding the compliance of the decision-making process with Article 6(1) of the ECHR, which grants the right to be heard by an independent and impartial tribunal.

#### Views formed in advance
Generally, the courts require bodies to exercise decision-making power fairly and objectively. Therefore, if in some way the body has already formed a view of the matter in question before considering its decision, the courts may intervene because this demonstrates the real possibility of bias having occurred ([[R v Kent Police Authority, ex parte Godden [1971] 2 QB 662]]).

This principle may also be infringed where a number of different bodies are involved in a case, and the same person is a member of more than one ([[Hannam v Bradford City Council [1970] 2 All ER]]).

The principle discussed above does not apply where only a provisional view, as opposed to a definitive conclusion, has been reached. See for example [[R v Reading BC, ex parte Quietlyn Ltd. [1987] 85 LGR 387]].

In [[Gillies v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2006] UKHL]] the House of Lords had to consider whether a member of a disability appeal tribunal (part of the Benefits Agency) was biased because she had a special interest in and experience of preparing reports for the Benefits Agency. The House again approved the use of the Porter v Magill test and concluded that there was no real possibility of bias in this case.

##### Autonomy of decision makers

In the case of [[R (Lewis) v Persimmon Homes (Teeside) Ltd [2008] EWCA Civ 746]], the Court of Appeal effectively stated that a predisposition of local councillors in relation to a planning application was not unlawful: they were entitled to have an opinion and justified in taking a general political position. It would only be if they could be shown to have had a 'closed mind' in relation to the specific application (i.e. that they had actually pre-determined it), that their decision could be quashed for bias. This case is quite notable as a strong judgment on the need for the courts to respect the political autonomy of local councillors.

The [Localism Act 2011, s 25(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/section/25/enacted) now makes it clear that a decision-maker will not to be taken to have had, or to have appeared to have had, a closed mind when making the decision just because s/he had previously done anything that directly or indirectly indicated what view the decision-maker took (or would or might take) in relation to a matter. The section only applies to local authorities, the National Park Authority and the Broads Authority.

#### Policy bias
Allegations of bias may arise where a government department, having formulated a particular policy, must then hear objections against the policy, as in [[Franklin v Minister of Town and Country Planning [1948] AC 87]]. Given the commitment of a department to its policy, how, it might be asked, can it consider objections impartially? (Note that there is an overlap here with the idea of [[Public Law II/Illegality#Fettering of discretion]]).

In Franklin, the House of Lords said that the only obligation on the part of the department in such a case is genuinely to consider objections submitted. If this is done, the fact that the department has adopted a particular point of view, because of policy on its part, will not invalidate the decision.

The principle was repeated in [[Ridge v Baldwin [1964] AC 40]].

#### Necessity

In rare cases, the duty to act fairly will have to give way to necessity. For example, if only one person is empowered to decide a question, then they cannot be disqualified for bias, because no decision could then be made.

In [[Dimes v Grand Junction Canal (1852) 3 HL Cas 759]], having set aside the decision made by the Lord Chancellor because of his pecuniary interest in the case, the House of Lords then dealt with the appeal on its merits, and affirmed the decision made by the Vice-Chancellor. However, before the appeal could proceed from the Vice-Chancellor to the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor had to sign an order for enrolment, which no one else was empowered to do. His interest in the case did not, therefore, prevent him signing the order, as otherwise the proceedings could not have progressed further.

In [[Wilkinson v Barking Corporation [1948] 1 KB 721]], a statute gave local authority employees pension rights under certain conditions. The statute also provided that any dispute should be decided firstly by the local authority itself and then, on appeal, by the minister. The Court of Appeal, somewhat reluctantly, upheld the power of the authority to decide disputes. Scott LJ commented on the statute: 
> '... its first provision is to subject the duty to pay to the jurisdiction, not of a court, not of a lay tribunal, not even of an impartial third party, but of the debtor himself! That almost converts its right into a mere discretionary privilege. At any rate the local authority is made, purely and simply, a "judge in its own cause".'
