## Constitutional significance

> "One must be very careful about any proposals whose aim is to cut down the right to judicial review... the courts have no more important function that that of protecting citizens from the abuses and excesses of the executive: central government, local government, or other public bodies... the more power that a government has... the more important it is for the rule of law that such abuses and excesses can be brought before an impartial and experienced judge who can deal with them openly, dispassionately and fairly"
> Lord Neuberger

JR is available in respect to public law acts of a public body, when there is no other avenue of appeal. 

Judicial review concerns the process by which a decision was reached, rather than the substance of that procedure (slightly oversimplification).

Authority: s 29 and 31 Senior Courts Act 1981, set out the High Court's power to review government decisions.

## Standing

Standing requirement: applicant must have sufficient interest in the claim. This could be 
- Individuals personally affected by the decision
- Public interest groups, e.g. NGOs
- Individuals representing the wider public interest
- Professional regulatory bodies representing the interests of their members. 

A different, narrower test applies for applicants seeking to bring a claim for breach of Convention rights. The person bringing a claim must be a 'victim'. Human Rights claims are usually made via Judicial Review. Failure by a public authority to act in accordance with Convention Rights is potentially unlawful due to HRA 1998.

## Categories
Very few categories of public decisions are genuinely 'out of scope'. Prerogative powers are generally not reviewed in practice. 

## Grounds
1. Illegality (breach of Convention rights)
2. Irrationality
3. Procedural unfairness

#### Illegality

A decision is illegal if not made with lawful authority.

#### Irrationality
A decision will be unlawful if it is so irrational that no reasonable decision-maker could have made it. 'Wensbury reasonableness'.

Proportionality is usually argued where breach of the European Convention on Human Rights is alleged. Principle: any interference with qualified convention rights must be necessary, and no more onerous than is required to achieve a legitimate purpose. 

#### Unfairness
Fairness is not a catch-all ground. Includes natural justice, legitimate expectation and procedural impropriety. 

## Remedies

- Interim remedies
	- Injunctions
	- Disclosure
	- Ordering witnesses to come to court
	- Urgent hearings
	- Bail
	- Stay proceedings
- Final remedies
	- Quashing order - nullifies a decision
	- Prohibitory order - prevents decision-maker from doing a certain act
	- Mandatory order - obliges decision-maker
	- Damages: low value and not frequently obtained. 

Judicial review is expensive and risky. It is possible to apply for an order limiting the amount of costs payable if the case does not proceed.
