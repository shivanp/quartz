## Context

Judicial review is concerned with checking the exercise of governmental power.

Courts and tribunals with judicial review jurisdiction are not concerned with the merits of a decision, and they do not remake the decision as an appeal court might. In judicial review the court considers whether a public law decision has been correctly made and implemented according to law.

Consequently, there is no absolute right to bring a judicial review claim, which can be contrasted with rights of appeal under various statutory schemes. Judicial review claimants must apply to the court for permission.

## Exhaustion of alternative remedies

The first point to note is that judicial review will only be appropriate if there is no suitable alternative remedy, or alternative remedies have been exhausted. Such alternatives might include
- a statutory right of appeal; 
- internal complaints or appeal procedures; 
- or a complaint to an ombudsman. 
 
 If alternative remedies are available, the court can refuse permission to bring the claim or refuse a remedy.

In [[R (Cowl) v Plymouth City Council (Practice Notice) [2002] 1 WLR 803]] the Council had offered to put the claimants’ grievance before a statutory complaints panel, but the claimants had still sought judicial review.

The Court of Appeal observed that insufficient attention has been paid to the paramount importance of avoiding litigation wherever possible and emphasised that, unless there is good reason, the courts should not permit proceedings for judicial review to proceed if a significant part of the issues between the parties could be resolved outside the litigation process.

## Procedure
- Ex parte application for permission
- Permission granted if ‘sufficient interest’ and an arguable case
- Full inter partes hearing

## Remedy
| Remedy            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quashing order    | The most common remedy. It overturns the impugned decision, and the public body must then take the decision again, applying the correct law or following a fair procedure.                                                                                        |
| Prohibitory order | Prevents a public body from acting or continuing to act unlawfully.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Mandatory order   | Compels the public body to perform a public law duty imposed by law.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Declaration       | The court may declare what the legal position is, or what the rights of the parties are. This does not question the public body’s exercise of the power. Declarations can be made without any other order or alongside other orders.                              |
| Injunction        | Orders a party to perform, or refrain from performing, a specific act. Injunctions are relatively rare. However, they are sometimes granted at the permission stage of the proceedings as a form of interim relief - either before or after permission is granted |
| Damages           | May be awarded but only if either (i) the court is satisfied that damages could have been awarded in a private law action or (ii) the public body has breached its duties under the HRA 1998.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Prerogative orders

The first three remedies – quashing, prohibitory, and mandatory orders – are collectively known as the 'prerogative orders’.

These are specific to judicial review, whereas the latter three can be granted in areas of private law too.

It is important to note that, as suggested above, remedies can be granted on an interim or final basis.

#### Discretionary remedies

The remedies, which the court may grant, are discretionary in nature. The significance of this was an important issue in [[Walton v Scottish Ministers [2012] UKSC 44]].

Here, Lord Carnwath argued that, given the widening of the rules on standing in recent decades, judicial discretion on remedies should act as a 'necessary counterbalance’.

On the facts Walton was unsuccessful in his challenge which related to the proposal for a new bypass for the city of Aberdeen. However, had he won the case, it may have been appropriate for the court to have taken into account what Lord Carnwath called the 'very attenuated nature' of his interest in the matter by granting a remedy some way short of an outright quashing of the road scheme in dispute.

In other words, the discretionary nature of remedies can be applied in a proportionate way in order to balance the degree of individual interest in the matter against the wider public interest.
