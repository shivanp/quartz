## Methods

#### Negotiation

Negotiation happens when two parties (whether legally represented or not) settle a dispute without help from a third party.

Imagine someone wants to bring a claim against a company for breach of contract. The company receives the letter before claim and obtains legal advice that they will probably lose the case. The company's lawyers advise them to offer to settle the claim. The company will make an offer of settlement to the claimant. Their opening offer will inevitably be lower than the highest offer they are prepared to make. The claimant will probably come back with a 'counter-offer'. By this process of negotiation, the parties will reach an agreement without having to start legal proceedings.

Remember, however, that negotiation can (and often does) take place after legal proceedings have started. It can take place at any time before the court has reached a decision on the claim. A negotiated agreement to settle is legally binding.

The Civil Procedure Rules, which govern civil litigation, encourage the parties to try to settle a claim.

#### Mediation

Mediation happens when the parties in dispute engage the services of an independent third-party mediator to help them identify the issues, communicate with each other, and reach an agreement.

- Mediation is an informal process.
- The Mediator does not express their own view of the merits of each party's case.
- The Mediator cannot impose an agreement – this must be reached by the parties themselves.
- The agreement reached is a binding contract between the parties; this can later be enforced by court proceedings if necessary.
- The parties need not reach an agreement on every aspect of their dispute. A partial agreement can be reached.
- Mediation is very common in family law, and compulsory in divorce cases.
- Parties usually share the costs.

#### Conciliation

Conciliation is very similar to mediation, with some key differences:

- A mediator will try and find common ground between parties without themselves assuming responsibility for developing or making any proposals for settlement.
- A conciliator will weigh up each party's position and offer their opinion as to the relative merits and make proposals regarding the terms of settlement.
- The parties then decide whether they want to accept the conciliator's proposals.
- It is essential that the conciliator is familiar with the subject matter of the dispute between the parties, so that they can give an accurate assessment of the merits.
- An agreement reached by conciliation is enforceable in the same way as a mediation agreement.

Parties usually agree to share the costs of conciliation.

#### Early neutral evaluation

In ENE, the parties in dispute agree to appoint an independent expert evaluator to assess each side’s strengths and weaknesses. This neutral, expert viewpoint then forms a starting point for negotiations to settle the dispute.

ENE does not result in a final decision. The evaluator does not decide legal issues or advocate a way of resolving matters. Instead, by indicating what each party realistically might be able to rely on in court proceedings took place, the evaluator provides an incentive to find agreement.

The outcome of the ENE process is usually non-binding on the parties. It is also carried out on a **'without prejudice' basis**, meaning that what the parties disclose about their respective positions cannot later be relied on by the other side in court.

The advantage of ENE is that the parties get an expert's view of their likelihood of success in legal proceedings.

#### Arbitration

Arbitration is the most formal of the ADR processes. It is governed by the Arbitration Act 1996:

"The object of arbitration is to obtain the fair resolution of disputes by an impartial tribunal without unnecessary delay or expense.” (s.1(a) Arbitration Act);

> “The tribunal shall 
> (a) act fairly and impartially as between the parties, giving each party a reasonable opportunity of putting his case and dealing with that of his opponent, and 
> (b) adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or expense, so as to provide a fair means for the resolution of the matters to be determined.”

Most commercial contracts contain a clause which states what will happen if there is a disagreement about the contract. The clause will often specify that the parties will refer to arbitration. This is known as an 'arbitration clause'.

The parties may choose the arbitrator, but the arbitrator's decision is binding and cannot usually be appealed.

#### Arbitrators

Arbitrators are usually qualified legal professionals, but they do not have to be 'authorised persons' under the Legal Services Act 2007.

Arbitrators do need substantial experience of the subject matter of the dispute.

An arbitration is quite similar to judicial proceedings in that witnesses give evidence and the evidence is tested. The parties are usually legally represented.

If more than one arbitrator is sitting, the arbitrators are known as the 'arbitral panel' or 'arbitral tribunal'.

In general, the losing party pays the costs of the arbitration, unless this would be unjust.
