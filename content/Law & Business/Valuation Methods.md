# Valuation Methods

## Net Asset Value

- Balance sheet gives a conservative estimate of the value of the business generally
	- Usually out of date by the time it has been approved and published.
	- Not all liabilities are captured, may not agree with their values
- Net assets – adjustments
	- Customer Service
	- Brand
	- Location
	- Real estate
	- Accounting policies – e.g., depreciation on a straight line basis
	- Goodwill
	- Off balance sheet items (e.g., future litigation)
- Balance sheet is a reasonable starting point
- Often used to value companies with portfolios of instantly marketable assets, like property companies.
- Not forward-looking
- Can be used on an insolvency.

## Dividend Valuation Model

- Present value of shares = discounted future dividends
- Gordan Growth Model
- Evaluation
	- Doesn't take into account market conditions – easier to calculate
	- Easy to make comparisons across companies
	- Growth forever? Could use a combination of growth rates for different phases of the company's growth
	- Dividends guaranteed? What if company doesn't pay dividends.
	- Payment of dividends dependent on distributable profits and directors' discretion. Can only really assume for big companies with a long history of paying dividends.
	- Doesn't take into account: brand, customer retention, intangible assets
- Can instead use discounted cash flows (discounting using WACC)
	- "Cash is king"

To value companies with temporarily high growth, analysts use a multistage version of the dividend discount model. For example, a two-stage dividend discount model allows for an initial high-growth period before the firm settles down to a sustainable growth trajectory. The combined present value of dividends in the initial high-growth period is calculated first. Then, once the firm is projected to settle down to a steady-growth phase, the constant-growth DDM is applied to value the remaining stream of dividends.

Have to guess at dividends in the near future, the appropriate discount rate and the ultimate growth rate of dividends.

### Sensitivity Analysis

Overwhelming portion of intrinsic value derives from the growth rate.  
e.g., if the growth rate were to drop by 1% to 1.5%, the value of the company would drop to £90.5m. Sensitivity analysis to highlight the inputs which needs to be most carefully examined.

## Market Multiples

- Looks at similar companies and looks at their price to earnings
- Not all the profit will actually be distributed to shareholders
	- Logic for using profit: the profit which is not distributed will be retained in the business and grow the business, potentially leading to a growth in the share price.
- Relationship between current earnings to share price - the investors' view
- The higher the PE ratio, the higher the confidence of investors in a company's prospects. PE ratio reflects the market's optimism of a firm's growth prospects.
- Compare to industry average.
- Can apply to valuation of limited company, with adjustment
- Importance of comparable company – how comparable is it?
- Accounting policies differ.

It is easy to verify that the P/E ratio increases with ROE. This makes sense because high-ROE projects give the firm good opportunities for growth.7 We also can verify that the P/E ratio increases for higher plowback, b, as long as ROE exceeds k. This too makes sense. When a firm has good investment opportunities, the market will reward it with a higher P/E multiple if it exploits those opportunities more aggressively by plowing back more earnings into those opportunities.

When the expected ROE is less than the required return, k, investors prefer that the firm pay out earnings as dividends rather than reinvest earnings in the firm at an inadequate rate of return. That is, for ROE lower than k, the value of the firm falls as plowback increases. Conversely, when ROE exceeds k, the firm offers attractive investment opportunities, so the value of the firm is enhanced as those opportunities are more fully exploited by increasing the plowback ratio.

Finally, where ROE just equals k, the firm offers “break-even” investment opportunities with a fair rate of return. In this case, investors are indifferent between reinvestment of earnings in the firm or elsewhere at the market capitalization rate because the rate of return in either case is 12%. Therefore, the stock price is unaffected by the plowback ratio.We conclude that the higher the plowback ratio, the higher the growth rate, but a higher plowback ratio does not necessarily mean a higher P/E ratio. Higher plowback increases P/E only if investments undertaken by the firm offer an expected rate of return greater than the market capitalization rate. Otherwise, increasing plowback hurts investors because more money is sunk into projects with inadequate rates of return.Notwithstanding these fine points, P/E ratios frequently are taken as proxies for the expected growth in dividends or earnings. In fact, a Wall Street rule of thumb is that the growth rate ought to be roughly equal to the P/E ratio. In other words, the ratio of P/E to g, often called the PEG ratio, should be about 1.0. Peter Lynch, the famous portfolio manager, puts it this way in his book One Up on Wall Street:The P/E ratio of any company that’s fairly priced will equal its growth rate. I’m talking here about growth rate of earnings here… . If the P/E ratio of Coca Cola is 15, you’d expect the company to be growing at about 15% per year, etc. But if the P/E ratio is less than the growth rate, you may have found yourself a bargain.

No description of P/E analysis is complete without mentioning some of its pitfalls. First, consider that the denominator in the P/E ratio is accounting earnings, which are influenced by somewhat arbitrary rules such as the use of historical cost in depreciation and inventory valuation. In times of high inflation, historic cost depreciation and inventory costs will tend to underrepresent true economic values because the replacement cost of both goods and capital equipment will rise with the general level of prices. As Figure 18.3 demonstrates, P/E ratios generally have been inversely related to the inflation rate. In part, this reflects the market’s assessment that earnings in high inflation periods are of “lower quality,” artificially distorted by inflation, and warranting lower P/E ratios.

Another confounding factor in the use of P/E ratios is related to the business cycle. We were careful in deriving the DDM to define earnings as being net of economic depreciation, that is, the maximum flow of income that the firm could pay out without depleting its productive capacity. But reported earnings are computed in accordance with GAAP and need not correspond to economic earnings. Beyond this complication, notions of a normal or justified P/E ratio, as in Equation 18.7 or 18.8, assume implicitly that earnings rise at a constant rate, or, put another way, on a smooth trend line. In contrast, reported earnings can fluctuate dramatically around a trend line over the course of the business cycle.

Finally, the least reliable components of value are growth opportunities, the purported ability of firms like Intel to invest in positive-NPV ventures that contribute to high market valuations today. Value investors don’t deny that such opportunities exist, but they are skeptical that precise values can be attached to them and, therefore, tend to be less willing to make investment decisions that depend on the value of those opportunities. We pointed out earlier that a good chunk of the market’s assessment of Facebook’s growth opportunities disappeared in one day when it reported disappointing earnings growth.
