# Undertakings

Aim: to give the lender control over the borrower once the agreement is executed, to protect the loan monies.

## Form and Purpose

Promise given by the bank to the borrower. May involve a promise to do/ not to something, or to procure that something is done/ not done by a third party within the borrower's control.

Categories:

1. Financial covenants
	- Financial targets which the borrower is required to meet during the life of the loan
	- Relate to profit, cash flow or net worth.
2. Information undertakings
	- Promises the provide the bank with certain information.
3. General undertakings
	- e.g., by prohibiting disposals, maintaining insurance and sticking to the key business.

> Breach of an undertaking is made an event of default, allowing the bnak to cancel its commitment and demand repayment. 

## Undertaking Vs Representation

Undertakings can often be recast as repeat representations (just stating the fact).

In either case, the likely result of the breach is an event of default. But preferable to get a borrower to represent the position at signing and also undertake to maintain the position throughout the term of the loan.

> [!tip]
> This results in a "tighter" constraint: the borrower is in default immediately as the undertaking is broken, rather than a repeating representation being tested at the time of repetition (typically at the start of every interest period). 

Also gives more flexibility: can make the representation more strict than the subsequent undertaking.

- Breach of representation may give remedies under Misrepresentation Act 1967;
- Breach of an undertaking may give remedies of specific performance/ injunction.
- Courts will not order specific performance where damages are an adequate remedy (almost always for a facility agreement).

## Financial Covenants

Undertakings which impose financial targets/ limitations on the borrower. Common for leveraged finance, unusual for investment grade borrowers. Two broad types: maintenance covenants and incurrence covenants.

### Maintenance Covenants

They require the borrower to maintain a specified level of financial performance and are tested regularly over the life of the loan facility. Measure past performance, not future prospects.

### Incurrence Covenants

Also set financial targets, but borrower must show compliance only if it wants to do specific things (e.g., dispose of large assets, acquire new companies, pay dividends).

If these are not done, the covenants are not incurred (not tested). Originated from high yield bonds.

### Limits and Ratios

Some financial covenants simply set a financial limit which a borrower must attain. More common to consider ratios.

#### Leverage Ratio

$$
\text{Net Debt} : \text{EBITDA}
$$

- Compares debt to earnings (profit) over a period (e.g., a year).
- Net debt
	- Debt defined as commercial borrowing, not short-term trade creditors.
	- Net debt is gross debt – freely available cash held
	- May be consolidated across a group.
- EBITDA
	- Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
	- Measure of profit.
	- Exceptional items typically excluded
	- Typical acquisition financing have a ratio of 4:1, 5:1.
	- Leverage ratio also called a "debt cover ratio". Different from gearing, which is $\text{Net Debt} : \text{Net Worth}$.

#### Interest Cover Ratio

$$
\text{EBITDA} : \text{Net Finance Charges}
$$

- Borrowers ability to cover the interest payment and fee obligations under its borrowing.
- Net Finance Charges exclude capital repayments.
- Any interest earned by the borrower from its investments is usually deducted from interest payable.
- ~ 2 : 1

#### Cashflow Cover Ratio

$$
\text{Cashflow} : \text{Net Debt Service}
$$

- Also known as “fixed charge cover”/ “debt service cover”
- Ability of a borrower to generate enough cash to pay all amounts due under its borrowing.
- Cashflow
	- Definition starts with EBITDA and then adjusts items included and excluded to represent cash movements more closely.
	- Starting point for whether the bank thinks the borrower has more cash than needed to run its business. Excess cash is often taken and used to prepay the loan in a “cash sweep”.
- Net debt service
	- Includes fees and interest payments due under commercial borrowing, but also any capital payments due
- ~ 1:1

#### Minimum Net Worth

 - A minimum net worth financial covenant aims to ensure the company maintains a minimum value of assets in the business.
 - The definition of net worth will vary.
 - Intended to represent the difference between assets and liabilities of the borrower.
 - Starting point: paid-up share capital + any reserves (shareholder funds in the balance sheet)
 - Most calculations exclude intangible assets. These include:
	 - Goodwill
	 - Capitalised R&D costs
		 - R&D usually entered as an expense
		 - May be lumped together and treated as an asset if it is reasonably certain that they will be recovered once the product is developed.
		 - Capitalised amount amortised to spread the cost over time as a form of accrual.
	- Patents, copyrights, licences etc.
		- Often not transferrable, worth little on insolvency
	- Payments on account
		- Excluded since they wold need to be repaid if the borrower did not perform.
	- Unaudited revaluation
		- To avoid the borrower over-inflating its value.
	- Tax provisions
		- Money set aside to pay taxes.

#### Capital Expenditure

Puts a limit on the amount which the borrower can spend on “long-term” business assets over a given period. Helps to retain cash to service the debt. Colloquially, “capex” provision.

#### Borrowing

Bank limits a borrower's exposure to other creditors. May be achieved through a financial covenant capping total borrowings. Might be linked to tangible net worth. Transactions likely to be included in the expanded definition of “borrowing”:

- Financial leases and instalment credit options.
	- Lesee will usually be required over the life of the lease to pay instalments to the lessor equivalent to the full value of the leased asset, together with a return on the capital value.
	- Lesee usually responsible for maintaining the asset.
	- Commonly used to fund computer hardware/ heavy machinery/ aircraft.
- Deferred purchase agreements
	- Buy now pay later
- Capital instruments
	- Bonds, notes, commercial paper.
- Guarantees and indemnities
	- Financial assurance given by the borrower in respect of any transaction.

When defining ratios, define terms specifically rather than relying on standard terminology.

### Information for Testing

- All companies must produce year end accounts
- Listed companies must produce interim accounts (unaudited) for first 6 months of their financial year.
- To test more than twice a year: bank can require B to supply a “compliance certificate” signed by 2 directors, confirming the financial covenants have been met on the requisite date. Usually accompanies by financial statements covering the period.

### GAAP and Accounting

B usually allowed to follow changes to GAAP as long as auditors provide a description of changes necessary to “convert” the statements to the original policies (“frozen GAAP” provision). Usually a provision for parties to negotiate re-setting the covenants, to avoid frozen GAAP becoming a big burden.

### Equity Cure

Borrowers traditionally could not “cure” a breach of financial covenants. Strong equity sponsors (PE firms etc.) have negotiated a right to inject cash into the borrower to help it meet financial covenants, either by prepayment or putting money into an account.

Equity sponsors would prefer to treat the new cash as EBITDA, but rarely given. Usually treated as positive cash flow.

## Information Undertakings

Effectiveness of most provisions depends on the bank receiving a regular supply of information from the borrower.

### Financial Information

Used to monitor the borrower's financial wellbeing and check for any breaches of financial covenants. Main sources:

1. Year end accounts (and possibly interims/ pro forma quarterlies), included consolidated accounts.
2. Management accounts (unpublished pro forma accounts for internal use).
3. Forecast of borrower performance, usually in the form of a projected balance statement.
4. Certificate showing compliance with all financial covenants
5. "Sweep-up" provision, any other information relating to financial condition which the bank requests. Borrower should negotiate this subject to no material cost (at least prior to default).

### Shareholder Documents

Often restricted to information which borrower is required by statute to send to shareholders.

### KYC

Undertaking by borrower to supply information reasonably requested by any lender in order to fulfil ongoing KYC obligations – this is standard. Borrower may ask to limit this to information within their possession and control, or which they can obtain with reasonable endeavours.

### Insurance

Maintaining adequate insurance for major assets – even if loan unsecured. Often coupled with undertakings to notify bank of material changes to insurance cover and produce copies of policies if requested.

### Notification of Default

Borrower to notify the bank if it defaults under the loan, and possibly also any “potential” events of default which might occur. This should be carefully defined.

Written confirmation to be given by directors at bank's request, confirming there has been no default or potential event of default.

## General Undertakings

Can be positive or negative promises.

### Positive Undertakings

- Insurance
	- Keep major assets insured.
	- Can also include "keyman" insurance (insurance for if key personnel leave the company, where the business is small). If the key man dies, lump sum paid to borrower.
- Consents, licences and laws
	- Undertaking that borrower maintain all necessary consents, authorisations and licences to perform its obligations under the loan document.
- Access to information and assistance
	- Very occasionally, bank allowed to inspect books/ records/ assets. Should be at reasonable notice and within office hours.

### Negative Undertakings

Prohibit borrower from doing something.

#### Negative Pledge

- Undertaking by the borrower not to create any security over its assets.
- Standard if borrower is unsecured, often insisted upon even if the bank has security, to protect the bank's floating charge security.
- Borrower may want to negotiate exceptions:
	- Security necessary under equipment leasing/ hire purchase agreements
	- Liens arising in the ordinary course of business (e.g., asset retained by third party until payment for services). Bank may restrict to a time period.
	- Cash collateralisation necessary for business
	- Security pre-dating the facility
	- Security acquired through purchasing asset/ business which is already subject to a security
	- Netting (“set-off”) arrangements between group companies
	- Retention of title clauses.
	- Project finance. Banks will usually want security over the asset being funded.
	- De minimis amount (“basket”) allowing a minimum amount of debt for which the borrower may create security.
- Often wording attempts to create security for the ban automatically in the event of a breach. Doubts over whether this is effective in English law.

#### Pari Passu Ranking

- The claims of the bank rank at least pari passu with the claims of all other present or future unsecured and subordinated creditors, except for those preferred by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar laws.
- Tries to ensure bank is not subordinated to unsecured creditors. Repeated representation often used here.

#### Disposals and Acquisitions

- Restriction/ prohibition on disposal of assets other than those in the ordinary course of trading/ in exchange for comparable assets.
- May allow disposal of obsolete assets.
- The clause might allow disposals at arm’s length up to a maximum aggregate annual value (a ‘basket’), or be tied in to mandatory prepayment.
- Restriction from substantial acquisitions/ mergers
- Undertaking that there will not be a substantial change to the general nature of the business.

#### Lending

- Carries the risk of non-repayment and a depletion of assets.
- Typically, an undertaking not to lend must be given, other than in the ordinary course of business/ within the group.

#### Shares and Dividends

- Undertaking not to make any distribution to shareholders without the bank's consent/ meeting of a financial test.
- The bank may agree that the undertaking will not apply to the borrower's subsidiaries.
- Take care if the borrower has issued any preference shares – giving such an undertaking may result in a breach of contract.
- If the borrower has subsidiaries, the bank may require the borrower to undertake not to allow subsidiaries to issue shares to third parties.

#### Auditors

- Any contractual clause that restricts an audited person's choice of auditor has no legal effect.
- Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 2016

#### Persons with Significant Control

- Register of individuals and entities must be kept.
- If a company fails to comply with this ‘people with significant control’ regime, the sanctions may prevent security being taken or enforced over the company’s shares. Secured facilities will therefore usually include an undertaking that the group companies will comply with the relevant requirements.

## Bank's Perspective

Choice of undertakings depends on the context of the loan.

When drafting, take care of “shadow director” provisions. If a bank uses the undertakings in its facility agreement to force a borrower to take certain action, it seems possible that the bank might be a ‘shadow director’. The time of greatest risk is usually when a borrower is in financial difficulties.

A shadow director may be held liable for wrongful trading under the IA 1986, s 214(7), and may have to contribute to a company’s assets on its liquidation.

### Borrower's Perspective

Provision of financial projections and management accounts can be v time-consuming if not already part of the directors' remit. Borrower's solicitor will need to ensure undertakings are not too tight. Insert “reasonable” wherever possible. Try to negotiate “cure” periods for as many breaches as possible. Try to get references to subsidiaries changed to “material subsidiaries”.
