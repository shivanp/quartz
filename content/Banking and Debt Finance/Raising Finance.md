### Glass-Steagall

Banking Act 1933 (Glass-Steagall Act) regulated the investments of many commercial banks and effectively prohibited commercial banks and investment banks from combining their businesses.

European banks didn't have Glass-Steagall equivalent so $\exists$ universal banks. Intended to benefit from economies of scale and synergies. Capital and customer base of the commercial business fed into the investment and advisory activities. Markets knew that the government would not allow the retail arms to fail, benefitting the investment banking operations.

1999: Glass-Steagall was eventually repealed, and US banks followed suit with universal banks (Citi, JP Morgan).

UK Independent Commission on Banking (“Vickers Report”) was set up to consider reforms of the UK banking sector to promote financial stability. Recommended forcing banks to separate their retail and investment bank businesses, and was adopted in HM Treasury White Paper. US authorities adopted the Volcker Rule, which is similar.
