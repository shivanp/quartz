# Common Securities

## Categorising Security

Different types of loan security have different effects:

- Security which gives the bank rights over an asset
- Security under which ownership in the secured asset is transferred to the bank
- Security under which a bank has actual (or "constructive") possession of the secured asset.

> [!defn] Ownership
> Having (legal or equitable) title to an asset.

> [!defn] Possession
> Having physical possession of an asset.

## Giving Rights Over Assets

Charges may be ‘fixed’ or ‘floating’ and are always ‘equitable’ (other than the ‘charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage’ (LPA 1925, s 87) which is arguably not a true ‘charge’ anyway).

## Fixed Charges

- The most certain way to ensure a secured asset is available to meet unpaid monies is to take possession of it (a “pledge”).
	- Prevents the borrower disposing of the asset or diminishing its value.
	- Impractical or impossible for a bank to take possession of certain assets (e.g., machinery)
- A fixed charge (“specific equitable charge”) gives the bank rights over an asset which:
	- prohibit the borrower from disposing of the asset without permission;  
	- attempt to maintain the asset’s value whilst it is in the borrower’s hands; and  
	- allow the bank recourse to the asset in the event of the borrower’s default under the loan.

This allows the borrower to use the charged assets unless and until any “enforcement event” occurs.

On an ‘enforcement event’, under its contractual rights in the charge document, the bank may require the borrower to sell the asset, or the bank may take possession of, and sell, the asset, or appoint a receiver to do the same (this carries less risk for the bank since the receiver acts as the borrower’s agent).

> [!tip]
> If the borrower sells an asset subject to a fixed charge, the rights created by the charge usually remain with the asset.

## Floating Charges

A fixed charge is still unsuitable to secure assets which a borrower might want to deal with quickly at an unspecified future date (e.g., stock). Most companies are unable to grant fixed charges for the majority of their assets. With a floating charge, whatever assets in a particular class that a borrower owns at any point in time are subject to the floating charge.

- A floating charge secures a group of assets, which may fluctuate from time to time.
- The assets secured by a floating charge are identified generically, for example a borrower’s ‘trading stock’ or its ‘undertaking and assets’.
- Unlike a fixed charge, a floating charge specifically allows the borrower to deal with the charged assets in the **ordinary course of business** (construed widely).
- Possible to create more than one floating charge over the same group of assets.

> [!defn]
> In [[Re Yorkshire Woolcombers Association [1904] AC 355]], a floating charge was defined as
> 
> - A class of assets, present and future; and
> - Which in the ordinary course of the company's business changes from time to time; and
> - It is contemplated that until the holders of the charge take steps to enforce it, the company may carry on business in the ordinary way as far as concerns the assets charged.

Subsequent cases have emphasised the third characteristic identified by Romer LJ. Thus, if a charge allows a borrower to deal with the charged assets without the bank’s consent, it almost certainly will not be a fixed charge. Similarly, if a borrower is not free to deal with secured assets without the bank’s consent, the security will be fixed even if it is described as ‘floating’ in the security document ([[Russell Cooke Trust Company Ltd v Elliott [2007] EWHC 1443 (Ch)]]).

### Crystallisation

When a floating charge crystallises, it ceases to float over all the assets in a class and instead fixes onto the assets in the class charged at the time of crystallisation. The lender then has control of these assets, and the borrower is unable to deal with them, as if the assets were subject to a fixed charge.

However, the assets subject to crystallisation of the floating charge are **not** treated as fixed charge assets for distribution purposes on a winding up.

If the company receives more assets of the same class after crystallisation, these are automatically subject to the crystallisation charge ([[NW Robbie and Co v Whitney Warehouse Co Ltd [1963] 1 WLR 1324, CA]]). The triggering events for crystallisation are set out in contract.

> [!note] Partial crystallisation
> Most charges provide for crystallisation to be simultaneously effective over all the assets secured by the charge. There is, however, no reason why a floating charge should not be partially crystallised.

- Advantages
	- Allows the company to deal with the secured assets on a day-to-day basis.
	- Allows the company to maximise the amount they are able to borrow.
	- Charge may be granted over the whole of the company's business.
- Disadvantages
	- On crystallisation, a floating charge ranks behind any fixed security created before it crystallised and is subject to any 3rd-party rights, including legal or equitable rights, which accrue prior to crystallisation.
	- Prior to crystallisation, the company could sell existing stock and not purchase new stock to replace it, if there is just a floating charge over stock.
	- Preferential creditors also take priority over the holder of a floating charge (e.g., employees, pension payments ([[Bloom and others v Pensions Regulator (Nortel, Re) [2010] EWHC 3010 (Ch)]]), ring-fenced amount for the unsecured creditors).
	- Under s 245 IA 1986, in certain circumstances a floating charge is automatically void and a liquidator/ administrator can set it aside (basically if created at the 'relevant time' where it was obvious the company would fail).
		- In Re Comet Group Limited, the judge described its purpose as “to prevent a company that is on its last legs from creating a floating charge to secure past debts or to secure moneys which do not go to swell its assets and become available for creditors”.
	- Crystallising a floating charge will create an effective stranglehold on a borrower: without the use of its current assets it cannot usually make any money.

Crystallisation occurs:

1. In common law
2. Specified event—as defined in the loan agreement. This usually occurs where a borrower defaults on the loan repayments or interest payments, or where another lender enforces their security.

#### Under Common Law

Events causing a floating charge to crystallise from case law:

- The borrower's liquidation
	- All types of winding-up, including a voluntary winding-up
	- But not just a petition for winding up being presented
- Appointment of a receiver/ administrative receiver by the bank
	- If the purpose of the administrative order is to prevent the borrower from continuing to run the business as a going concern
	- Mere crystallisation of another floating charge will not cause crystallisation under common law.
- Borrower ceasing to carry on business
- Intervention by the bank.

#### Under the Charge Document

Circumstances precipitating crystallisation commonly agreed contractually between the borrower and bank in the charge document:

- An immediate right to crystallise the floating charge upon giving notice to the borrower.
	- Borrower may add “if the bank reasonably believes the secured assets are in jeopardy”
- $\exists$ specified events which crystallise the charge without any action by the bank - "automatic crystallisation"
	- e.g., appointment of an administrator.

#### Post-crystallisation

> [!important]
> A floating charge creates an immediate security interest but does not attach to any individual asset until crystallisation. 

Crystallisation does not in itself create a new charge to be registered under the CA 2006 ([[Re Manurewa Transport Ltd [1971] NZLR 909]]).

#### Weaknesses of Floating Charges

- Later fixed charges
	- Vulnerable to later fixed charges (unless there is a prohibition on creating further security)
- Administrator's costs
	- Floating charges rank behind administrator costs and expenses.
	- All liquidation expenses (other than litigation expenses) have automatic priority over floating charge holders, and are recoverable from the assets of the company
- Preferential creditors
	- Any proceeds realised from assets secured by a floating charge must be used to pay any ‘preferential debts’ of the company before meeting claims under the floating charge (IA 1986, s 40).
		- ‘Preferential debts’ are defined as including (s 386 & Sch 6 IA 1986) outstanding employees' wages and pension scheme contributions.
		- Prescribed part fund for unsecured creditors; 50% of the first £10,000 of the prescribed part and 20% thereafter, subject to a maximum amount of £800,000 if created on or after 6 April 2020 (£600,000 if created before) (see IA 1986, s 176A).
- Avoidance of floating charges.
	- Liquidator/ administrator can apply to court to have a floating charge set aside (s 245);
		- If granted to a connected person within 2 years of the onset of insolvency, or
		- If granted to an unconnected person within 12 months of the onset of insolvency.
	- Not invalid in either case to the extent that it is in return for valuable consideration given on or after the creation of the charge.

## Transfer of Ownership

### Mortgages

The security provider retains possession of the asset, but transfers ownership to the creditor. Security taken by transferring ownership (i.e., legal or equitable title) to the bank, along with a right to sell on default and an obligation to re-transfer title on satisfaction of the debt. Highest form of security.

Subject to the security provider's right to require the creditor to transfer the asset back to it when the debt is repaid. Right is known is the '[[equity of redemption]]'. The equity of redemption is held in reserve and only exercised if the borrowed money is not repaid.

A type of mortgage (known as “charge by way of legal mortgage” or “charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage”–s 87 LPA 1925) is usually taken over land. Ownership will remain vested in the security provider in this case.

> [!tip]
> A mortgage can therefore be thought of as an ‘enhanced’ charge, since it gives rights over an asset which are backed with a transfer of legal or equitable title.
> $\text{Mortgage} = \text{Right of appropriation} + \text{Transfer of ownership}$

Subject to contrary intention (and statutory restrictions in the case of land), a (legal) mortgage entitles the bank to take immediate possession of the mortgaged asset. But taking possession is not required to perfect the security.

#### Mortgage Over Land

The only way to create legal security over freehold or leasehold land is by way of ‘a charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage’ (LPA 1925, s 87). The net result is to provide the bank with rights equivalent to granting it a 3,000-year lease (or, for leasehold, a lease for one day less than the borrower’s lease).

#### Equitable Mortgages

If a mortgage does not transfer legal title, it will be an equitable mortgage. These can be created by:

- Written agreement by a borrower that the property is secured by equitable mortgage
- Agreement to provide a legal mortgage if the borrower intended the agreement to have immediate legal effect.
- Mortgage over an equitable interest
	- Where the borrower holds an equitable interest in the land (i.e., they are not a legal owner, e.g., a beneficiary in a trust of land), any mortgage of that interest will be equitable in nature.
	- Such a mortgage can be created very informally. In accordance with [s 53(1)(c) LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/53), such a mortgage need only be in writing and signed by the grantor in order to be validly created.
- Purported legal mortgage that does not comply with the necessary formalities.
	- A mortgage over registered land which is not granted by a valid deed or that is not completed by registration will not take effect as a legal mortgage (it will be defective).
	- However, it may be regarded as an equitable mortgage if it complies with [s 2 LP(MP)A 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/2). Equity will recognise it as a ‘contract to grant a legal mortgage’ providing it is in writing, contains all the agreed terms and is signed by both the mortgagor and mortgagee.

There is little practical difference between an equitable mortgage and equitable fixed charge.

##### Disadvantages of Equitable Mortgages

> [!warning]
> An equitable mortgage can be ignored by a bona fide purchaser (or ‘security taker’) for value of the legal title to an asset without notice (actual or constructive) of the equitable security.

But this disadvantage is largely overcome if the equitable security is registered since this provides notice of the security to anyone searching the register.

An equitable mortgage may not benefit from the ‘automatic’ powers vested in legal mortgagees under LPA 1925, s 101, which include the power of sale (although these powers should be specifically given in the security document).

## Giving Physical Possession

### Pledge

> [!defn]
> A pledge is a way of creating security by the actual (or constructive) delivery of a tangible movable asset to a creditor, to be held until the performance of an obligation (eg, repaying a debt). The bank will take possession while the borrower retains ownership.

There is a right to sell the asset to settle the debt owed, upon the giving of reasonable notice.

#### Pledgee Rights

The security is the possession of an asset. A pledged asset must be “delivered” by the borrower. This can be through physical delivery or “constructive delivery” i.e., vesting control (e.g., keys to a safe deposit box).

> [!note] Delivery of documents
> Assets may be pledged by delivery of documents, if these documents effectively provide control. So holding the share certificate of a registered share does not give sufficient control, even if accompanied by a blank stock transfer form. 

The pledge ends when the pledged asset is returned to the borrower. The most important right implied by a pledge is the right to sell pledged assets to meet a defaulted debt.

#### Problems

A bank will probably want to take a pledge only over valuable assets - how can these be kept secure? The bank will probably be liable as bailee while it holds the pledged assets, and this may entail insurance costs.

No legal requirement to document a pledge, but documentation is a good idea (“letter of pledge” / “memorandum of deposit”).

#### Pledge-able Assets

- Asset must be capable of actual/ constructive delivery.
- Common to pledge bearer instruments (e.g., bills of exchange, bearer bonds).

### Lien

The right to physical possession of the debtor's goods until the debt is paid. But no right to sell these assets to settle the debt owed. Liens arise automatically under English law in certain types of commercial relationship.

3 types:

1. Common law/ particular liens
	- Allows retention of the goods under which the debt arises (e.g., a dry-cleaner retaining cleaned suits until paid).
2. Statutory/ general liens
	- Statutory liens allow certain persons to retain any goods in their possession against any obligation owed to them by the owner of those goods.
	- Arise by operation of law without any agreement
	- e.g., stockbrokers, solicitors, innkeepers benefit.
3. Equitable liens
	- Lien does not require possession of the property to which it attaches (usually land) and will give a right of sale through application to the court.
	- Also possible for a lien to be created by a contract.

Common law and statutory liens are both types of legal lien. Legal liens will usually require actual possession of the property which has been rightfully acquired. Generally no right to sell the property, with the exception of a banker's lien.

## Assignment

An assignment may be used to create a mortgage over certain assets.

The most common assets secured by assignment are a borrower’s rights against a third party (‘choses in action’), for example debts, and rights under various contracts.

An assignment by way of security can be legal or equitable:

- Legal if s 136 LPA 1925 complied with (“statutory assignment”) - notice in writing.
	- Written notice alone will not necessarily be sufficient to make an assignment legal as opposed to equitable. For example, an assignment of part will always be equitable even if notice is given.
- Equitable “assignment by way of charge”.

Assignment ‘by way of charge’ is expressly excluded from s 136 and so assigning rights by way of security will constitute a legal assignment only if it is an absolute assignment with a proviso for re-assignment on satisfaction of the secured obligation.

> [!statute] 136 - Legal assignments of things in action.
> 
> (1) Any absolute assignment by writing under the hand of the assignor (not purporting to be by way of charge only) of any debt or other legal thing in action, of which **express notice in writing** has been given to the debtor, trustee or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to claim such debt or thing in action, is effectual in law (subject to equities having priority over the right of the assignee) to pass and transfer from the date of such notice—
> - (a) the legal right to such debt or thing in action;
> - (b) all legal and other remedies for the same; and
> - (c) the power to give a good discharge for the same without the concurrence of the assignor:
> 
> Provided that, if the debtor, trustee or other person liable in respect of such debt or thing in action has notice—
> - (a) that the assignment is disputed by the assignor or any person claiming under him; or
> - (b) of any other opposing or conflicting claims to such debt or thing in action;he may, if he thinks fit, either call upon the persons making claim thereto to interplead concerning the same, or pay the debt or other thing in action into court under the provisions of the M1Trustee Act, 1925.

Assignments by way of security will always include a provision (either explicit or implied) for reassignment on satisfaction of the debt. Priority between assignments depends on notice being given to the third party.

> [!warning]
> It is not possible to take a legal assignment over future choses in action. So an assignment can never cover e.g., future debts.
