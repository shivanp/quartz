# Due Diligence to Term Sheet

## Context

There are 3 contexts for commercial bank lending:

1. Investment grade loans/ corporate credit
2. Leveraged loans – debt substantial compared to borrower's earnings/ share capital. Usually used for acquisition finance.
3. Cross-over credit – borrower borderline investment grade.

The process and terms relating to an investment grade loan are discussed. The borrower usually approaches the bank, but when the markets are flush with cash, banks may approach potential borrowers.

Bank must obtain approval from internal credit procedures before a loan is offered. Once loan approved, the term sheet is drafted.

## Due Diligence

Fact finding exercise. Scope of investigation depends on risk of transaction, size of loan, market liquidity, etc. Typical features:

- Account officer
	- Individual assigned to each borrower, provides a point of contact. Account officer will put together a very basic package for agreed loan
- Credit analysis
	- Account officer's proposal undergoes credit analysis
	- May be done by a different team/ by the account officer.
	- Internal procedures may stipulate that there must be a material adverse change clause or cross-default clause (it is an event of default to default on another loan).
	- Private company has 9 months after year-end to publish accounts, public company 6 months, London company has 4 months.
	- Smaller borrowers may be asked to produce interim or management accounts.
- Credit clearance
	- Credit department sanctions the analysis.
	- Internal limits and policies checked.
	- Proposal may be rejected.
- Final term sheet drafted by account officer.
- Borrower may immediately accept bank's draft, or negotiate (requiring re-approval by credit department). Bank may involve advisers.
- Solicitors instructed to put together initial draft facility agreement on the basis of the term sheet.

```ad-note
A solicitor can obtain copies of a corporate borrower's registered documents to get information. But if the borrower has not filed returns propely, this would result in a fine for the company and its officers.But there is no provision for compensating a 3rd party who suffers loss.

### Acquisition Finance

Traditionally >DD, since more leveraged and risky. But disclosure could be limited in a liquid market with multiple bidders/ during a hostile takeover.

## Term Sheet

Term sheet records the principal terms of a transaction. Signed by the parties, but not intended to be commercially binding. Term sheets are often attached as an Appendix to a short letter – the commitment letter/ mandate letter – which contains any legally binding terms required at the outset.

The point of the term sheet is to “focus minds”. If the facility is to be syndicated, helpful for the arranging bank to have an accurate summary of the main terms. Acts as an outline from which the bank's solicitor can extract key information.

## Commitment Letter

Contains:

1. Whether the bank's obligation to arrange the facility is “best efforts” or underwritten
2. Any general conditionality to the offer to arrange (e.g., time limits, subject to credit approval, due diligence).
3. Material adverse change provision allowing the bank to withdraw the offer if there is a market change (“market mac”) or to the borrower's situation (“business mac”)
4. Clear market clause: borrower agrees not to raise other finance while facility is being arranged
5. “Market flex” clause; allowing the bank to change aspects if necessary to attract other banks to participate.
6. Provisions for recovery of fees, costs and expenses if the deal doesn't go ahead, and an indemnity for any losses the bank might suffer.

## Basic Term Sheet

A term sheet is not a facility agreement:

- May specify the type of undertakings, but will not include a draft clause
- "Guarantees may be given by all material subsidiaries of the borrower".
- Use inclusive lists; preface open lists by "including, but not limited to".
- Specify unusual provisions.

## Legal Effect

Term sheet not intended to be legally binding. Term sheets have considerable “moral authority”. Usually not binding under English law. An agreement to agree is not legally enforceable if there is a material term of the future contract which has not been expressly or impliedly agreed. But usual to use language specifying that parties do not intend it to be legally binding.

Private equity houses raising finance for an acquisition usually produce their own term sheet from which to negotiate the loan. These are long, detailed and favour the borrower.

There is no implied duty of good faith under English law. So either party may withdraw at any time ([[Walford v Miles [1992] 2 WLR 174]], with the *Petromec* exception).
