# Boiler Plate and Mechanics Clauses

## Repayment, Prepayment and Cancellation

### Repayment Clause

Arguably the most important provision in the agreement. Form of repayment depends on type of facility. Overdraft usually on demand and does not require a repayment date.

### Prepayment

Most loans will allow a borrower to repay capital early. Without a contractual provision, borrower probably has no right to prepay a loan. Prepaying will save interest payments. Borrowers may refinance existing loans partway through their term.

#### Broken Funding

If B repays, the bank may be left to service an interbank loan without an equivalent interest stream from the borrower. Or bank may incur breakage fees for terminating the interbank loan early. So usually there is a "break costs" clause. Paying break costs could be avoided if B prepays at the end of an interest period.

### Prepayment Fee

Banks will ask for a prepayment fee (“prepayment premium”) to cover administration costs of early repayment. Loans for leveraged acquisitions may feature call protection: an extra amount payable by the borrower if it prepays within e.g., 12 months of utilisation. Unlikely to be drafted into agreements for senior facilities.

### Order of Application

Amortised loans: banks resist treating a partial pre-payment as an early settlement of the next repayment due. The bank wants a borrower to demonstrate the financial control necessary to maintain a steady repayment regime. May insist that any prepayment is treated as satisfying the final repayment first, and then in inverse order (reduces life of loan) / spread over the scheduled amounts rateably (reduces exposure but maintains relationship).

### Preference

If borrower becomes insolvent $\leq 6$ months of prepayment (or 2 years for connected party), risk of liquidator/ administrator applying to set aside the prepayment as a preference under s 239 IA 1986. Typically, a remote risk.

### Mandatory Prepayment

For an investment grade facility, there are 2 circumstances in which a borrower will be required to make a mandatory prepayment:

1. If it becomes unlawful for a bank to lend to the borrower (e.g., sanctions).
2. If there is a change in control of the borrower. Control is typically defined as the ability to remove half or more of the directors, the ability to dictate how the company is run, the holding of a majority of the shares in the borrower, or the ability to cast more than half the shareholder votes.

Leveraged facility usually includes additional mandatory prepayment events:

1. If the borrower disposes of certain fundamental assets other than in the ordinary course of business (and assuming the proceeds are not required to purchase a replacement asset);
2. If the borrower receives insurance monies for an asset it is not replacing;
3. If the borrower generates more cash than it is deemed to require to run its business (this is known as an ‘excess cash sweep’);
4. If the facility is required to fund an acquisition and the purchase price is subsequently adjusted downwards due to a revaluation event; and
5. If the borrower subsequently raises funds through an issue of shares or debt securities.

Repayment is usually allocated pro rata across banks.

### Cancellation

If a loan provides a commitment period over which the borrower is allowed to utilise the facility, the bank most likely charge a commitment fee for making the facility available. Many loans allow the borrower to cancel during the commitment period and save on commitment fees. May be mandatorily cancelled in the event of default.

## Margin Protection

The interest rate charged by a bank on a syndicated loan is typically calculated by adding the margin to the estimated cost of lending. If the cost of lending rises, the bank will want to have mechanisms to pass this onto the lender.

### Regulatory Capital

If a bank cannot recover money it has lent, there is a danger it may be unable to repay depositors and other lenders. To reduce this risk, banks required to maintain regulatory capital. This is a minimum level of assets which must be maintained as a “buffer”.

#### Origins

- The Basel Committee (1980s) came up with Basel Capital Accord, adopted by all major banking jurisdictions.
- A more sophisticated version, Basel II (2008) was adopted by most countries (except US).
- Basel III implemented 2013-23.

#### Rationale

> [!important]
> The key proposition of Basel regime is that a bank needs to recover its assets (primarily loans) to repay its depositors: if there is a risk that an asset cannot be recovered in full, it must be backed by ‘capital’ to create a ‘buffer’. Capital buffer known as "regulatory capital".

Starting point: regulatory capital is 8% of the value of each asset (but this is a minimum). Assets must be risk weighted.

#### Risk Weightings

- Basel I approach: calculation of counterparty credit risk was relatively crude, grouping diverse borrower types into single risk categories.
- Basel II better: banks used a "standardised approach" or "internal ratings based" approach.

| Approach              | Details                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standardised approach | Banks apply counterparty risk weightings as pre-determined in the regulations. |
| IRB approach          | Allows a bank to use its own internal model to calculate the risk of recovery from different counterparties.                                                                                |

#### Types of Capital

What is capital? Not just cash in an account. Basel II splits into 3 types. At least half a bank’s regulatory capital had to be core Tier 1 capital, and Tier 3 capital could only be used to cover limited regulatory capital requirements.

| Tier of capital | Details                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1          | Includes ordinary share capital, verified net profits and certain reserves. |
| Tier 2          | Less permanence than Tier 1 and might incur fixed costs.                    |
| Tier 3          | Least stable, e.g., short-term subordinated loans, non-verified profits.                                                                             |

#### Basel III & IV

Even more stringent requirements, including new buffers, increase in capital requirement for systemically important banks, liquidity requirements.

#### Increased Costs Clause

Cost of maintaining regulatory capital passed to the borrower as part of the margin on a loan. If the cost of capital increases, this eats into the margin and reduces profit. Such a provision can be resented by the borrower.

### Mandatory Cost

PRA funds itself by leveraging fees against regulated fees. Facility agreements give banks the opportunity to recover these costs from the borrower. But LMA withdrew the schedule from market documentation in 2013, and now not used much.

## Costs and Expenses

Bank will require a borrower to indemnify it against the incidental costs it incurs setting up and running the loan. Includes:

- Costs of negotiation, preparation and execution
- Registration of loan and ancillary documents
- Preservation and enforcement of the bank's rights under the loan.

Usually covered by an indemnity from the borrower in the mandate letter.

## Fees

Types include

- Front end fees
	- For initial work done to put the loan together.
	- For a syndicated loan, known as the “arrangement fee”.
	- Arranger may have used participation fee to attract other banks to the syndicate.
	- Amount of fees remaining once the arranger has paid any participation fees is called "praecipium".
- Underwriting fee
	- Initial banks underwrite syndication.
- Commitment fee
	- Charged on committed but undrawn money.
	- Usually 25-50% of the margin.
- Agent's fee
	- Bank which takes on agency role (administrative or security agent)
- Cancellation fee
- Utilisation fee
	- For facilities intended to be used only rarely, e.g., standby or swing-line facilities.

### Fee Letter

Fees usually put in a separate fee letter. Provides confidentiality from syndicate members, other borrowers and the market. The facility agreement will specifically refer to the agent's fees - but not the amount – to avoid argument that the arrangement is a secret profit in breach of fiduciary duties.

## Remedies

### Remedies and Waivers

Most facilities contain the following boilerplate:

> The rights and remedies of the Bank under this agreement:
> 1. shall not be waived by any failure, or delay, in their exercise;
> 2. are cumulative, and shall not exclude or restrict its rights and remedies under any other agreement or the general law; and
> 3. may be exercised in whole, in part, and as often as necessary.

(1) tries to avoid the borrower using the equitable doctrine of “laches” (form of estoppel) to preclude the bank exercising a right/ remedy after unreasonable delay. But by case law, continued performance of a contract inconsistent with termination and will result in a loss of the right to terminate ([[Tele2 International Card Company SA v Post Office Limited [2009] EWCA Civ 9]]).

(2) says the bank can use more than remedy at once. Tries to avoid any merger of rights between facility agreement and security document (about not losing an inferior security, which may happen under case law if you also have a superior security).

### Partial Invalidity

Include:

> If any provision of this agreement is prohibited, unenforceable, void or invalid, that shall not invalidate, or otherwise affect the enforceability of, the remaining provisions hereof.

Two underlying principles in relation to severance:

1. a court will not construct a new contract: any severance must leave the original contract standing and not alter its basic scope or intention; and
2. a court will not sever if to do so is against public policy.

[[Goldsoll v Goldman [1915] 1 Ch 292]] blue pencil test (can you just cross out the severed provisions in blue pen).

### Amendments and Waivers

No alterations to the provisions of an executed document will be effective without the agreement of all parties. Most syndicated facilities allow amendments and waivers to most of their clauses to be agreed by a majority of the syndicate (defined in the agreement as either $\frac{2}{3}$ or "simple majority" - $\frac{1}{2}$).

Common provisions:

| Provision     | Details                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yank the bank | Clause allowing the borrower to take a bank out of the syndicate if the bank votes against an amendment/ waiver which the majority of banks voted to allow. |
| Use or lose   | If the bank does not vote on an amendment/ waiver within a time period, the bank's commitment is disregarded in calculating whether the borrower gets the required majority.                                                                                                                                                             |

## Force Majeure

Suppose there are circumstances in which the contracting parties consider performance of their obligations is, through no fault of their own, no longer possible. The clause may provide that obligations under the contract are suspended until circumstances have passed or that the contract is immediately terminated. Usually no sanctions attached.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

### Common Law

Under common law, parties are free to choose governing law provided that their choice is bona fide and legal ([[Vita Food Products Inc v Unus Shipping Co Ltd (in Liquidation [1939] AC 277]]). This determines issues including the validity of the document and any amendments, interpretation of clauses and remoteness of damages.

### Rome I

Allows complete freedom to choose the governing law of a **contract** (expressly or impliedly), although public policy and some mandatory rules may supersede the governing law if necessary. The Regulation is retained EU law.

### Rome II

Allows parties to choose the governing law of **non-contractual** obligations. The choice will be upheld if:

1. The claim falls within Rome II
2. The context is a commercial activity
3. The choice of law was freely negotiated.

### Choosing

May be bank's country, borrower's country, or English law (for stability and for being creditor friendly). If parties do not choose, courts check for an implied choice (e.g., choice of jurisdiction).

### Jurisdiction

Specifies the jurisdiction of enforcement.

The three regimes that have usually applied to a contract giving jurisdiction to English courts are:

1. the Recast Brussels Regulation which applies to proceedings commenced on or after 10 January 2015 binding all EU members.
2. the 2007 Lugano Convention, which binds EU members, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland; and
3. English domestic law.

Complicated by Brexit.

Some facility agreements contain one-sided jurisdiction clauses, allowing the bank to sue in the named jurisdiction or any other competent jurisdiction, but only allowing the borrower to sue in the named jurisdiction. Though these have been challenged in court, still included in most facility agreements.

### Agent for Service of Process

If any of the obligors in the facility is not an English registered company and does not have a branch or other place of business in Great Britain, the service of any English court documents on that obligor would require service ‘out of jurisdiction’.

> [!statute] CPR 6.11(1) - Service of the claim form by contractually agreed method
> Where –
> - (a) a contract contains a term providing that, in the event of a claim being started in relation to the contract, the claim form may be served by a method or at a place specified in the contract; and
> - (b) a claim solely in respect of that contract is started,
> 
> the claim form may, subject to paragraph (2), be served on the defendant by the method or at the place specified in the contract.

The usual contractually agreed method is to appoint a 3rd party to receive documents on the obligors' behalf. This avoids a bank having to apply to court for leave to serve a foreign corporation. Several companies offer services for a fee.

## Miscellaneous

Other provisions include:

- Inter-bank provisions
	- Monitoring of defaults
	- Liability for actions and information
	- Resignation of agent banks
	- Indemnities
	- Sharing of money if some banks receive money or recover money and others do not
- Set-off
	- Authority from borrower giving the bank a right (but not an obligation) to set off credit balances in favour of the borrower against any amounts due but unpaid.
	- Set-off is the cancellation of mutual obligations outside of a court proceeding. It allows a debtor to reduce the amount it owes to a creditor by the amount the creditor owes to the debtor. Set-off is a self-help remedy that is governed by state statutory and common law.
- Notices
	- Communications must be written and may be sent by post or by fax. By email if agreed by both parties.
	- Banks might want deemed service provisions for borrower, but will never accept a reciprocal arrangement.
- Defaulting lender provisions –
	- If a lender becomes insolvent, B may be able to
		- Cancel any undrawn commitment of a defaulting lender.
		- No commitment fee payable on any retained commitment
		- If defaulting lender retains a commitment, it will not be allowed to vote on any decisions under the facility (it is disenfranchised).
		- Defaulting lender may be forced to transfer participation in the facility to another lender at par.
		- Any amount lent under revolving credit facility automatically turned into a term loan.
		- Identity of a defaulting lender disclosed by the agent to the borrower.
		- If facility agent defaults, agent may be bypassed and can be removed by a majority vote of the remaining banks.

## Execution

Where a syndicated loan requires a party to perform several defined roles, conventional for a bank to execute separately for each of the roles. s 44(6) CA 2006 requires that if a director is signing a document as director for more than one company (quite common for large groups), they must sign separately for each company.

> [!question]
> Whhat if the loan involves a large syndicate and it is not possible to find a signing date which works for everyone?

1. Documents can be sent to each signatory in turn (cumbersome)
2. Absent party may appoint someone to sign on their behalf under a power of attorney, created through a deed. The attorney can sign in their own name or that of the principal (s 7(1) Powers of Attorney Act 1971).
3. Document may be executed in counterparts – identical copies simultaneously signed. Methods:
	1. Printed documents sent to each party by post/ courier. After signing, parties return their documents to the solicitor. The original agreement is a composite of the counterparts.
	2. Documents circulated by email/ made accessible via an online platform. Signed document signed as PDF and returned.
	3. Documents circulated by email, instructions to print and sign signature pages, and then scan into PDF and return with the electronic copy of the unsigned original. The true original document is the electronic version.
	4. Signature pages printed, signed and returned. This means there is no “original document”. Cannot be used for executing deeds or agreements with land clauses.
	5. Just signature pages circulated. Solicitor authorised to affix signature pages and document treated as executed. Cannot be used for deeds/ land agreements.

## US Vs English Loan Facilities

Factors:

1. Similar insolvency regimes.
2. Generally easier to take security over all the borrower's assets under US law and registration/ enforcement regimes are more standardised.
3. US more litigious: unconnected 3rd parties can purchase and pursue legal claims
4. US has more liquidity – convergence between loan and bond market terms.

Differences:

- Call protection
	- US phrase for early prepayment fee.
- Limited amortisation
	- Annual amortisation ~1% on the term loan
- Covenant lite
	- English leveraged loan facilities oblige the borrower to show regularly (e.g., 3 months) that it is maintaining financial performance predicted in business plan.
	- US facilities just have a single financial covenant, tested if the borrower wants to take specified actions. Cash flow covenants rare. Much less onerous.
- MAC event of default.
	- Not included in US law facilities.
- Majority lender votes
	- US typically requires 1/2, English usually requires 2/3.
- Loan transfer
	- US facilities will allow the term loan to be freely transferred without borrower consent.
	- English more restrictive; may be a white list of acceptable transferees/ borrower consent required.
