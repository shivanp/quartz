# Facility Specifics

## Intro Clauses

- Date clause
	- First page
	- Completed simultaneously with singing
	- If several parties, date at which the last party signs.
- Parties
	- Mechanism for new borrowers (“Acceding Borrowers”).
	- Guarantors may be required.
	- Obligors = borrowers + guarantors.
	- Names of all the banks with their different functions.
	- Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 gives 3rd parties rights to enforce a contractual term if the contract expressly provides, or if the term confers a benefit to the party. Most facility agreements exclude the effect of the 1999 Act other than its protective implications.

## Interpretation/ Definitions

Defined terms appear a the front. Many documents have an interpretation section, defining common words such as month, immediately after the definitions section.

## Facility

Facility clause outlines the type of facility provided by the bank and the amount to be made available. Many contain both a term loan and an RCF. Each bank in the syndicated loan agrees to provide a proportion of the total facility, known as the bank's commitment. This will specify that obligations are several - not joint and several.

### Why Facility

The term loan facility may be more appropriate than loan agreement:

1. Term agreement suggests the borrower has agreed to borrow money and is obliged to draw down.
2. If a document acknowledges or creates debt, it may be classified as a ‘debenture’ ([[Levy v Abercorris Slate and Slab Co (1887) 37 Ch D 260]]). If facility agreements are debentures, they may then be ‘specified investments’ under the FSMA 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (RAO). This would trigger licensing requirements for banks carrying out regulated activities with respect to specified investments. So loan facilities often deliberately drafted to create a commitment to lend but not to create or acknowledge a debt. UK regulators have accepted that such facilities fall outside of FSMA 2000. Court of Appeal screwed up in [[Fons Hf v Corporal Ltd and Another [2014] EWCA Civ 304]] by suggesting that a loan agreement is an instrument creating and acknowledging debt and therefore a debenture, but the FCA has indicated that this decision does not change how it views loan agreements.

```ad-question
How can a bank prove that a borrower owes it any money
The accounting records kept by a bank showing the total amount outstanding and certified by an appropriate oficer are prima facie evidence of the borrower's obligations. Facility agreement will usually require the borrower to accept the account recordds as conclusive evidence. N.B. in the US, bank account records are insufficient evidence. A "promissory note" (certificate acknowledging utilisation) would need to be issued.
```

### Facility Office

Facility office/ lending office is the particular branch of the bank through which a loan is booked. Will be specified in the loan agreement. Important for tax reasons.

## Purpose Clause

### Control

The bank will want the facility agreement to explicitly state how the loan monies can be used. Wording may be quite wide ("general corporate purposes").

Connected matters: capacity and authority.

### Capacity

Banks will want to ensure that the borrower has unrestricted capacity to borrow under the facility, and to give guarantee and or security if applicable.

```ad-statute
title: s 39(1) - A company's capacity
The validity of an act done by a company shall not be called into question on the ground of lack of capacity by reason of anything in the company's constitution.
```

Gives protection to third parties. But banks will usually check articles anyway since the stakes are high.

### Authority

The bank must be sure that whoever executes the facility agreement on behalf of the borrower has authority to do so.

```ad-statute
title: s 40 - Power of directors to bind the company

(1) In favour of a person dealing with a company in good faith, the power of the directors to bind the company, or authorise others to do so, is deemed to be free of any limitation under the company's constitution.

(2) For this purpose—
- (a) a person “deals with” a company if he is a party to any transaction or other act to which the company is a party,
- (b) a person dealing with a company—
	- (i) is not bound to enquire as to any limitation on the powers of the directors to bind the company or authorise others to do so,
	- (ii) is presumed to have acted in good faith unless the contrary is proved, and
	- (iii) is not to be regarded as acting in bad faith by reason only of his knowing that an act is beyond the powers of the directors under the company's constitution.

(3) The references above to limitations on the directors' powers under the company's constitution include limitations deriving—
(a) from a resolution of the company or of any class of shareholders, or
(b) from any agreement between the members of the company or of any class of shareholders. 
```

In practice: the bank checks the director has authority. Doesn't want to be relying on “good faith”. The bank will insist on a board meeting to approve and execute the transaction.

### Resulting Trust

A purpose clause is also included in an attempt to create a **resulting trust** if the purpose fails. This was first recognised in [[Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567]].

## Bank Deposits

```ad-important
A bank is not a trustee of money deposited by its customers. Rather it is a debtor in respect of those deposits.
```

Key case: [[Foley v Hill (1848) 11 HLC 2]]

Lord Cottenham LC:

> Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal. […] The money placed in the custody of a banker is, to all intents and purposes, the money of the banker, to do with it as he pleases; he is guilty of no breach of trust in employing it; he is not answerable to the principal if he puts it into jeopardy, if he engages in a hazardous speculation; he is not bound to keep it or deal with it as the property of his principal, but he is of course answerable for the amount, because he has contracted, having received that money.

Thus, a debt is a different legal concept from a trust. But they are not mutually exclusive. They  
can be combined in a single transaction.

### Quistclose Trust

The best example of a device which combines a debt and a trust is a “Quistclose trust”. The name derives from the case in which such arrangements were first recognised: [[Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567]].

This was applied in [[Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12]]. Twinsectra is the most important case on Quistclose trusts as it makes clear that it is not sufficient to demonstrate that money was advanced to the borrower for a particular purpose. Rather, it is necessary to demonstrate the parties’ mutual intention that the money could only be applied for the purpose and was not at the free disposal of the borrower. It is this feature of the transaction which generates the trust in favour of the lender.  

```ad-tip
A Quistclose trust does not arise where money is paid for a purpose but is at the recipient’s free disposal.
```

Twinsectra also provides helpful guidance on the requirement for certainty of purpose:  

1. The borrower’s power to apply the money is valid only if the purpose is sufficiently certain.  
2. A purpose is certain if it is possible to determine whether any given application the money does or does not fall within it.  
3. If the purpose is uncertain, the borrower cannot make any use of the money and simply holds it on trust for the lender.

#### Operation of Quistclose Trust

- When the lender advances the money to the borrower, the borrower holds the money on trust for the lender, with a power to use it for a specified purpose.  
- To the extent that the borrower uses the money for the purpose, the lender’s equitable interest is extinguished. The relationship changes from trustee-beneficiary to debtor-creditor.  
- To the extent that the borrower applies the money for any other purpose, the borrower commits a breach of trust. The lender can assert their equitable proprietary interest in the misapplied money (or its traceable proceeds).  
- If it becomes impossible to apply the money for the purpose, the borrower must return the money to the lender.

See also [[Re Farepak Food and Gifts Ltd (in administration) [2006] EWHC 3272 (Ch)]].

#### Other Contexts

It is worth noting that although most of the case law involves loans or transactions involving money, Quistclose trusts are not restricted to such circumstances. They arise in any situation where property is transferred to a person whose use of the property is restricted to a specified purpose: to any case where the property is not at the free disposal of the transferee. ([[Ali v Dinc [2020] EWHC 3055 (Ch)]], paras 234, 238).

```ad-important
On the insolvency of the borrower B, any money held by B on trust for the bank must be paid to the bank, irrespective of any other claims.
```

## Condition Precedent

### Purpose

Specific conditions which a bank requires a borrower to fulfil before facility agreement takes place. Tangible evidence that the representations and warranties have been met.

Borrower will not be able to utilise unless and until the CPs are satisfied. Advantages for the bank:

1. Borrower is locked into the min provisions of the agreement regardless. Bank fees are payable and remedies for default apply.
2. Representations, warranties, undertakings, events of default and boiler plate all become operative as soon as the document is executed. So bank can begin monitoring.

### Waivers

If the borrower cannot satisfy one or more conditions precedent before closing (date on which facility is meant to become available), will have to ask the banks for temporary/ permanent waiver. In practice, the bank's solicitor takes responsibility for ensuring satisfied/ waived.

### Uncertainty

CP could be so vague as to make the agreement void for uncertainty. For example, a condition in a contract which stipulated that the sale was ‘subject to the purchaser obtaining a satisfactory mortgage’ was held to make the entire contract void in [[Lee-Parker v Izett (No 2) [1972] 2 All ER 800]]. It is, however, common to see wording requiring a CP document to be ‘in form and substance satisfactory to the banks’. Likely to be certain enough in legal terms.

The bank may ask for original documents/ certified copies. Most CPs involve providing documentary evidence. May also be a CP that no event of default is continuing.

### Conditions Subsequent

If a deal is fast (e.g., acquisition finance), some CPs may be delayed to happen within a period after utilisation, such as the granting of full security.

### Borrower Perspective

- Be wary of CPs requiring third party actions.
- Talk to the bank – likely to be flexible if problems addressed in good time.
- Try to agree forms of certain documents which are to be "in form and substance satisfactory to the bank" in advance, like legal opinions. Ask to add “reasonable”.
- If there's a syndicate, try to push for acceptable of documents by the agent bank/ by a simple majority in the syndicate.

## Availability

### Single Utilisation Facility

Simple term loan facility might allow the money to be utilised in one amount on a specified day. Utilisation clause will say that if the borrower is not default and complies with all its obligations, the bank will comply with the utilisation request.

### Multiple Utilisation Loan

B allowed to utilise in a number of tranches as and when required, up to the available amount. Tranches must be utilised within a specified commitment period. RCFs even more flexible. Usually there is a commitment fee.

### Notice of Utilisation

```ad-important
Fundamental premise of syndicated facility mechanics is that banks will use the interbank market to fund large advances ("matched funding"). 
```

Borrower will therefore be required to give notice of utilisation, with the notice period depending on the currency (on the London market, Sterling could be funded on the day of request). Common for a syndicated loan to require B to give 3 business days notice for Eurocurrencies, or 1 business day (day before) notice for Sterling. Notice periods may be shorter with a revolving credit facility.

Once utilisation notice given, B is usually committed to taking the money. In each utilisation request, the borrower must confirm there is no current default and that utilisation will not result in a default.

## Floating Rate Interest

Most loans are at floating rate interest.

### Base Rates

Commercial banks raise loan capital through attracting depositors and issuing debt securities. Incur regulatory costs. Bank's base rate amalgamates these costs to provide a general cost of raising funds. Typically used to charge interest on bilateral loans to individuals and small/ medium-sized businesses.

Bank of England publishes the official rate, decided by the MPC each month. Commercial banks' base rates will usually follow the movements of the official rate.

### LIBOR

Commercial facilities, typically syndicated, will not usually use base rates. Floating rate used, made up of:

1. LIBOR, or equivalent
2. Margin: bank's profit and covering regulatory capital costs.

LIBOR is the London Interbank Offered Rate; the interest rate charged for loans between banks in the London interbank market. Intended to provide banks with liquidity. LIBOR rates depend on :

1. Currency
2. Duration
3. Credit standing of borrowing bank
4. Liquidity of interbank market.

The definition should specify the date and time at which the rate is to be set.

### Screen Rate

British Bankers Association publish an average LIBOR rate: bbalibor or screen rate. Widely used across products and markets. But found to have been manipulated – to create a healthier picture of banks' credit quality during credit crunch. Govt. took the measure away from BBA and awarded it to ICE. ICE uses the same methodology. Similar rates in other financial markets.

### SONIA

Majority of LIBOR rates ceased to be published immediately after 31/12/21. In relation to sterling, LIBOR is largely replaced by the risk-free rate Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA). Rates reflect the average interest that banks pay to borrow overnight from other financial institutions. Based on actual transactions. Features:

1. Considered “risk-free” rates because they do not include any premium for term or credit risk;
2. Not published as forward-looking term rates, so parties cannot know in advance how much interest will be due at the end of those periods; and
3. Each currency will have its own distinct risk-free rate and related administrator.

A term and implicit credit premium was always incorporated into LIBOR. As participants switch, an adjustment is required to adjust for the differences that exist. Known as a Credit Adjustment Spread (“CAS”). Aim: the amount of interest aid by a borrower after transition is as close as possible to under LIBOR.

So under SONIA:  

$$
\text{Interest payable} = \text{SONIA} + \text{CAS} + \text{Margin}
$$  

CAS calculated as the historic 5-year median average difference between SONIA and LIBOR.

Regulators made "synthetic LIBOR" to prevent market disruption. Any remaining references to LIBOR deemed to rely to synthetic LIBOR. Not really relevant any more.

### Screen Rate Unavailability

If a screen rate is used, it might be unavailable/ insufficient to cover the banks' actual funding costs. Provisions may be included for:

- Interpolation between shorter and longer rates
- Shortening interest period to a tenor that it available
- Using historic interest rates
- Using reference banks.
- Cost of funds – requires each bank in the syndicate to provide the agent with its actual cost of funding the loan, to be added to the margin. Usually use as a last resort (v burdensome).

## Fixed Rate Interest

Tend to be unattractively high. Better to use hedging.

## Interest Periods

The borrower may be required to pay interest at regular intervals throughout the term of the loan, or tranches may be divided into interest periods of varying duration. Interest periods primarily chosen to support matched funding:

1. Interest period mirrored by interbank loan (1/3/6 months)
2. LIBOR/ SONIA recalculated at the start of each interest period and applies for the duration of that period (sometimes). So can really be a succession of different fixed rates.
3. Interest payable at the end of each interest period.
4. Borrower can select the duration of each interest period, giving it more control over the rate and timing of payment.
5. Repayments/ prepayments required to coincide with the end of an interest period
6. Some representations will be repeated on the first day of each interest period.

## Apportionment

Interest rates quoted at an annual rate. Bank and borrower must agree the basis on which the annual interest will be apportioned between each interest period (“day count fraction”).

- For domestic sterling facility agreements, traditional basis is dividing by 365
- For others, it is 360 (check this).

## Ratchets

The facility agreement may provide for the margin to vary in accordance with the health of the borrower, measured through monitoring its financial ratios (cross-over/ leveraged) or credit rating (investment grade).

## Hedging

Leveraged borrowers typically have large loans and high margins. Many hedge their exposure to interest rate fluctuations by entering an interest rate swap. Borrower contracts to periodically pay a fixed amount to the counterparty in return for the floating rate. Often a syndicate bank provides the hedge.

## Default Interest

If a borrower fails to pay a sum due under a facility agreement, default interest charged on any overdue amount (a fixed rate above the usual rate payable). But cant be a penalty clause because then it would be unenforceable! [[Cavendish Square Holdings BV v Talal El Makdessi [2015] UKSC 67]].

### Liquidated Damages

Contracts arise from the agreement of the parties. The starting point of contract law is to support parties' agreements on as many matters as possible.

The parties can agree not only to the terms of the contract, but also the nature and scope of the consequences of a breach of contract.

> A liquidated damages clause stipulates a certain sum which is to be payable on a particular breach of contract.

This can be commercially advantageous for a company, since it fixes the amount that will be due for a breach as a debt arising under the contract (reduced uncertainty). Means a party can take risks into account when determining the price for a contract. Very common clauses in construction and technology industries.

#### Court Intervention

There are instances where a court will intervene. Courts have jurisdiction to intervene in a contract to strike down a liquidated damages' clause which requires the party in breach to pay an excessive sum such that it becomes a 'penalty'. If a clause is regarded as a penalty, it will be struck down by the Court, and the claimant will only be entitled to 'unliquidated damages' (those assessed in the normal way).

> A **penalty clause** is a liquidated damages' clause which requires the party in breach to pay an excessive sum, such that it becomes a penalty, and therefore the clause will not be upheld.

Test for determining whether a clause is a valid liquidated damages clause or a penalty: [[ParkingEye Limited v Beavis [2015] UKSC 67]] and [[Cavendish Square Holdings BV v Talal El Makdessi [2015] UKSC 67]] (these two cases were heard together).

#### *Makdessi* Test

Is the clause a primary or secondary obligation?

- A clause will be primary if it is part of the primary obligations in the commercial context of the contract, i.e., furthers the commercial objective of the contract.
- A clause will be secondary if it is an obligation triggered by a breach of contract to compensate the innocent party.

If primary, the clause will not engage the penalty rule at all, so will be valid.

If secondary, the clause will be a penalty if it imposes a detriment out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in the performance of the primary obligation. Test for this:

- What (if any) legitimate business interest is served and protected by the clause?
- Is the detriment imposed to protect that interest extravagant, exorbitant or unconscionable?

The burden of proof is on the person alleging that the clause is a penalty to prove this.

The law on penalties is a clear interference with freedom of contract, so will not be invoked lightly to strike down a clause in a contract freely negotiated between parties of equal bargaining power. A party can sometimes have a legitimate interest in enforcing performance which goes beyond simply being compensated for losses. A clause which is not disproportionate to that protection of legitimate business interest will be upheld.

Where the parties have negotiated a contract, on a level playing field and with the assistance of professional advisors, it will be hard for the party paying liquidated damages to challenge the validity of those provisions on the basis that they are a penalty.

Careful drafting to frame provisions as primary rather than secondary obligations can reduce the chance of a party falling foul of the law on penalties ([[Holyoake v Candy [2017] EWHC 3397 (Ch)]]). Key: to prevent an allegation that the clause is a secondary liability payable on breach in either substance or form.

For example, taking a scenario where Brett agrees to build a house for Damon at a price of £100,000 by 15 May 2019:

(a) a clause requiring payment of a sum of £1000 per day for late completion might be regarded as secondary and subject to the law on penalties; alternatively

(b) the obligation could be redrafted so that the price payable is lower, but Brett receives a 'bonus' for delivery on time. This provision might be regarded as a primary obligation intended to set the price and so not subject to the law on penalties.

MERMAID3

Practically, most facility agreements impose default interest of 1-2%.
