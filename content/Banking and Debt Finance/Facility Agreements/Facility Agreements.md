# Raising Finance

## Borrowers

3 main categories:

- Governments – sovereign debt
- Companies
- Others (partnerships, sole traders, supranational organisations, educational institutions).

4 methods of raising money:

1. Share capital;
	- Ordinary shareholders invest money in return for a share of the business.
	- Money non-returnable as far as the company is concerned.
	- But profits are usually distributed to shareholders.
	- Gearing = debt/ equity.
2. Retained profits;
	- Directors decide how to use any profit.
	- Paid to shareholders/ working capital
3. Loan facilities; and
	- Company borrows with a flexible and reliable source of funds.
	- Overdraft/ term loan etc.
4. Capital markets instruments.
	- Debt securities
	- Most common: bond
		- Issuer repays borrowed capital on maturity
		- Interest paid at intervals
	- Tradeable asset
	- Bonds, notes, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and loan stock.

## Lenders

Two main types of commercial lender:

1. Banks
	- Raise money primarily from depositors, from issuing debt securities and by borrowing from each other.
	- Individuals can lend indirectly through their contributions to pension funds and insurance policies.
2. Institutional lenders
	- Create funds in which investors invests

## Banks

| Type             | Details                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commercial banks | Raise money by attracting deposits and then lend that money to individuals, companies governments and others. |
| Investment banks | Sell advice and underwrite securities issues.                                                                                                               |

### Glass-Steagall

Banking Act 1933 (Glass-Steagall Act) regulated the investments of many commercial banks and effectively prohibited commercial banks and investment banks from combining their businesses.

European banks didn't have Glass-Steagall equivalent so $\exists$ universal banks. Intended to benefit from economies of scale and synergies. Capital and customer base of the commercial business fed into the investment and advisory activities. Markets knew that the government would not allow the retail arms to fail, benefitting the investment banking operations.

1999: Glass-Steagall was eventually repealed, and US banks followed suit with universal banks (Citi, JP Morgan).

UK Independent Commission on Banking (“Vickers Report”) was set up to consider reforms of the UK banking sector to promote financial stability. Recommended forcing banks to separate their retail and investment bank businesses, and was adopted in HM Treasury White Paper. US authorities adopted the Volcker Rule, which is similar.

### Central Banks

Bank of England acts as the Government's banker and adviser on monetary policy. Regulates the money markets by lending or borrowing and setting interest rates. Lender of last resort for other banks. Linked to UK bank supervision at the FCA and PRA.

## Financial Solicitor

Most city law firms have the following finance teams:

1. General banking
2. Capital markets and securitisation
3. Project finance
4. Asset finance
5. Derivatives and regulatory practices.

# Due Diligence to Term Sheet

## Context

There are 3 contexts for commercial bank lending:

1. Investment grade loans/ corporate credit
2. Leveraged loans – debt substantial compared to borrower's earnings/ share capital. Usually used for acquisition finance.
3. Cross-over credit – borrower borderline investment grade.

The process and terms relating to an investment grade loan are discussed. The borrower usually approaches the bank, but when the markets are flush with cash, banks may approach potential borrowers.

Bank must obtain approval from internal credit procedures before a loan is offered. Once loan approved, the term sheet is drafted.

## Due Diligence

Fact finding exercise. Scope of investigation depends on risk of transaction, size of loan, market liquidity, etc. Typical features:

- Account officer
	- Individual assigned to each borrower, provides a point of contact. Account officer will put together a very basic package for agreed loan
- Credit analysis
	- Account officer's proposal undergoes credit analysis
	- May be done by a different team/ by the account officer.
	- Internal procedures may stipulate that there must be a material adverse change clause or cross-default clause (it is an event of default to default on another loan).
	- Private company has 9 months after year-end to publish accounts, public company 6 months, London company has 4 months.
	- Smaller borrowers may be asked to produce interim or management accounts.
- Credit clearance
	- Credit department sanctions the analysis.
	- Internal limits and policies checked.
	- Proposal may be rejected.
- Final term sheet drafted by account officer.
- Borrower may immediately accept bank's draft, or negotiate (requiring re-approval by credit department). Bank may involve advisers.
- Solicitors instructed to put together initial draft facility agreement on the basis of the term sheet.

> [!note]
> A solicitor can obtain copies of a corporate borrower's registered documents to get information. But if the borrower has not filed returns propely, this would result in a fine for the company and its officers.But there is no provision for compensating a 3rd party who suffers loss. 

### Acquisition Finance

Traditionally >DD, since more leveraged and risky. But disclosure could be limited in a liquid market with multiple bidders/ during a hostile takeover.

## Term Sheet

Term sheet records the principal terms of a transaction. Signed by the parties, but not intended to be commercially binding. Term sheets are often attached as an Appendix to a short letter – the commitment letter/ mandate letter – which contains any legally binding terms required at the outset.

The point of the term sheet is to “focus minds”. If the facility is to be syndicated, helpful for the arranging bank to have an accurate summary of the main terms. Acts as an outline from which the bank's solicitor can extract key information.

## Commitment Letter

Contains:

1. Whether the bank's obligation to arrange the facility is “best efforts” or underwritten
2. Any general conditionality to the offer to arrange (e.g., time limits, subject to credit approval, due diligence).
3. Material adverse change provision allowing the bank to withdraw the offer if there is a market change (“market mac”) or to the borrower's situation (“business mac”)
4. Clear market clause: borrower agrees not to raise other finance while facility is being arranged
5. “Market flex” clause; allowing the bank to change aspects if necessary to attract other banks to participate.
6. Provisions for recovery of fees, costs and expenses if the deal doesn't go ahead, and an indemnity for any losses the bank might suffer.

## Basic Term Sheet

A term sheet is not a facility agreement:

- May specify the type of undertakings, but will not include a draft clause
- "Guarantees may be given by all material subsidiaries of the borrower".
- Use inclusive lists; preface open lists by "including, but not limited to".
- Specify unusual provisions.

## Legal Effect

Term sheet not intended to be legally binding. Term sheets have considerable “moral authority”. Usually not binding under English law. An agreement to agree is not legally enforceable if there is a material term of the future contract which has not been expressly or impliedly agreed. But usual to use language specifying that parties do not intend it to be legally binding.

Private equity houses raising finance for an acquisition usually produce their own term sheet from which to negotiate the loan. These are long, detailed and favour the borrower.

There is no implied duty of good faith under English law. So either party may withdraw at any time ([[Walford v Miles [1992] 2 WLR 174]], with the *Petromec* exception).

# Facility Agreement Options

## Types of Facility

3 types of general purpose loan facility:

1. Overdraft
2. Term loan
3. Revolving credit facility.

A loan facility may be committed or uncommitted.

> [!defn]
> A facility is committed if the facility agreement, once executed, obliges the bank to advance monies at the borrower's request. If the bank has some discretion, the facility is uncommitted.

### Overdraft

- A tool to aid cash flow to aid any shortfall in working capital.
- Uncommitted facility
- “On demand” $\rightarrow$ must be repaid whenever the bank demands, even f the borrower has not defaulted.
- Usually provided on the bank's standard terms, with little room for negotiation.
- Subject to a maximum aggregate amount which may be borrowed at any one time
- May be subject to a “clean-down” provision.
- Relatively expensive way to borrow.

### Term Loan

- Provides a specified capital sum over a set period (term) with an agreed repayment schedule.
- Usually a lump sum borrowed for a specific purpose.
- Committed facility
- Borrower allowed availability period/ commitment period after executing the facility agreement during which it can draw down a lump sum up to a specified amount.
- May be an extended availability period during which the money can be drawn down in portions (tranches, advances, loans).
- Schedule of repayment:
	- Amortisation - repayment in equal amounts at regular intervals over the term of the loan. Repayment “holiday” at the start of the loan.
	- Balloon repayment – instalment amount increases towards maturity
	- Bullet repayment – at maturity.
- Once capital has been repaid, it cannot be re-borrowed.
- Refinancing might be agreed.
- Generally term is $\leq 5$ years
- Not usually “on demand” - the bank cannot withdraw the facility unless the borrower defaults.
- Might be a multicurrency term loan; drawn amounts may be redenominated.
- Interest on a term loan usually floats at a fixed percentage above LIBOR/ SONIA.

### Revolving Credit Facility

- Provides a maximum aggregate amount of capital available over a specified period.
- Allows a borrower to draw down and repay tranches of the available capital.
- Combines flexibility of an overdraft with certainty of a term loan.
- Borrower can save money by not drawing the whole loan at once.
- Each tranche usually borrowed for a short period of time (e.g., 1-6 months) after which it is technically repayable. But if the borrower has not defaulted, the tranche to be repaid can immediately re-drawn. Known as a “rollover”.
- With a revolving credit facility, the utilisation and repayment will be subject to more restrictions than an overdraft:
	- Minimum notice periods before each utilisation
	- Max/ min amounts which may be drawn down in one tranche.
	- Minimum period for which an amount must be borrowed before repaid.
	- Maximum number of tranches which may be drawn at any time.
	- Control over the frequency and timing of repayment.
- Bank will usually charge a “commitment fee”, calculated as a % of the undrawn facility from time to time.
- Clean down provision may be included
	- Ensures the money borrowed under an RCF is used for working capital rather than long-term capital.
	- e.g., borrower has to reduce facilities to £0 for 5 consecutive business days a year.

### Ancillary Facilities

Syndicated facility agreements may include both a term loan and an RCF in one document.

## Syndicated Facilities

Large or sophisticated facilities are usually provided by a group of banks known as a syndicate. Not unusual to find syndicates of >30 banks.

### Structure

- Usually, one or more banks act as the “arranger(s)”.
- This structure is known as primary syndication.
- Syndicate members participate in the syndicate on common terms and with common documentation.
- Each syndicate member only liable for its own lending obligations; will not undertake any responsibility for other syndicate members' commitments.

#### Arranger

The arranger/ mandated lead arranger/ MLA is the bank responsible for:

1. advising the borrower as to the type of facility required;
2. finding other banks to form the initial syndicate; and
3. negotiating the broad terms of the loan.

#### Secondary Syndication

Once the facility has been made available, the participating banks might sell part or all of their commitment to other banks or institutional lenders – secondary syndication.

But a borrower will usually require the arranger to retain a substantial part of the facility, known as the “minimum hold”, so the arranger has a stake in organising the facility and ensuring the syndicate runs smoothly.

> [!action]
> The facility agreement should specifically state that the arranger does not owe any other syndicate members any common law fiduciary duties. 

#### Administrative Agent

Common for one bank, known as the administrative agent, to act as agent for the others in the day-to-day running of the loan. Must act as the:

1. Interpreter (communicating between borrower and syndicate)
2. Counsellor (dealing with any practical problems)
3. Policeman (monitoring borrower's compliance)
4. Postman
5. Record keeper
6. Conduit for payments.

Carries out the duties and responsibilities of an agent. But the facility agreement will contain provisions to limit the relationship, known as “exculpatory provisions”:

1. Agent will not want any obligation to act unless instructed by the syndicate
2. Agent will want the ability to delegate its functions and to take professional advice if necessary
3. Agent will want syndicate members to take responsibility for their own credit assessment of the borrower.
4. Syndicate members to complete their own KYC (Know Your Customer) checks to comply with money laundering obligations.
5. Agent permitted to take an agency fee and indemnity for costs, liabilities and losses, from the borrower
6. To the extent that costs, losses and liabilities are not recovered from the borrower under (e) above, the agent will want an indemnity from the syndicate;
7. Agent will always want a right to resign, and the syndicate will want the right to replace it. This will entail provisions dealing with notice periods and the procedure for appointing a successor (either by the agent or by the majority lenders depending on the circumstances). Borrower given consultation rights on any replacement to the agent.

#### Security Trustee

> [!defn]
> If a syndicated loan is secured, one entity (usually one of the syndicate banks) will usually hold the security on trust for the whole syndicate. This entity is known as the ‘security trustee’.

Fiduciary duties imposed are more extensive than those of a simple agent.

#### Taking a Role

Several advantages;

- Prestige
- Ability to charge fees
- Relationship with the borrower

### Tombstones

Once a large deal is closed, announced by way of an advert in the financial press with details. Cast in Perspex block and given to parties and advisers. Now less common.

### Liability of Arrangers

Arranger will provide information about the borrower in an “information memorandum” (info memo). Usually contains financial information, general information and market information.

The arranger is potentially liable for any wrong information the info memo contains which is relied on by the lenders deciding to joint the syndicate. Claims may be brought for misrepresentation or negligence. There is also a tortious duty of care ([[Sumiomo Bnk Ltd v Banque Bruxelles Lambers SA, 1996]]).

So it is standard for a clause in the info memo to state:

- the borrower has supplied the information and confirms it is true, complete and accurate; has been prepared with reasonable care; is not misleading; and does not omit anything material;
- the borrower confirms that any assumptions or projections it makes are reasonable and in good faith;
- the arranger has not independently verified the information; does not make any representations or undertakings with respect to it; does not take responsibility for it; and accepts no liability for loss caused by reliance on it; and
- participants in the facility acknowledge the info memo is not a valuation of the borrower’s credit; that it is not a recommendation to participate; and that they should make their own independent assessment of the documentation and the borrower.

Effectiveness of such disclaimers:

- Courts tend to interpret limitation clauses strictly.
- UCTA 1977~ disclaimer of liability for negligence or misrepresentation must be reasonable.
- Arranger is almost certainly under duties anyway not to withhold relevant information and to answer fully any specific questions.
- In [[IFE Fund SA v Goldman Sachs International [2007] EWCA Civ 811]], Court of Appeal ruled that disclaimer language commonly used in information memoranda is effective to deny an arranger’s liability for the accuracy of information and to deny responsibility for updating it.

## Leveraged Acquisition Facilities

Usually involves more than one source of lending to raise the maximum amount of debt. Consists of a senior facility providing a term loan and revolving facility ("revolver") and a mezzanine facility providing a second term loan. Senior lenders get first right to repayment and control the enforcement process on default. Mezzanine lenders get a higher interest rate. But mezzanine facilities rare recently - there is usually a senior facility and a high yield bond.

## Short-term Lending

Other forms:

- Standby facility – backup facility, may include a utilisation fee.
- Bankers' acceptance – bill of exchange which the bank has agreed to be responsible for paying which it falls due. Borrower must eventually pay back the bank.
- Swing-line facility – made available to a company which has a commercial paper programme (IOU). Can be used on very short notice to allow the borrower to pay back any maturing commercial paper which it is unable to reissue (rollover).

## Anatomy of Facility Agreement

Provisions in a loan document almost all designed to protect the bank's position.

### Bank Concerns

Will want to ensure:

1. Fees are paid
2. Interest received on the loan
3. Loan capital returned.

Aims best served by ensuring that:

- Loan monies only used for a specific purpose
- Borrower doesn't do anything financially risky
- Borrower monitored to give early warning of any possibility of default
- All monies due to the bank secured over the borrower's assets.

4 main types of clause:

1. Mechanics clauses
2. Margin protection clauses
3. General protection clauses
4. Boilerplate clauses.

#### Borrower's Concerns

Primary concern: flexibility. Main areas to negotiate relate to the monitoring of and restrictions on the borrower.

## Matched Funding

Most facility agreements assume that when the borrower requests a utilisation, the facility banks will fund their commitment by borrowing the sum from other banks on the London interbank market. Loans on interbank market typically short term (~6 months). Interest payable on successive interbank loans recovered from the borrower.

This assumption drives lots of provisions, such as interest periods, repetition of representations, repayment, prepayment and break costs.

# Representations

## Facility Agreement

Through the due diligence process, the borrower will provide facts, records, forecasts, business plans, documents of title etc. Most important pieces of information are recorded in the facility agreement as representations. Reasons:

1. To elicit information
2. To provide a drawstop if they are untrue
3. To allow the bank to call a default if they are untrue.

### Legal Representations

Relate to the validity of the borrower, any guarantor and the loan documentation. All 6 are usually repeated.

- Status
	- Borrower required to state it is duly incorporated under the laws of the original jurisdiction and the representation repeated to ensure the jurisdiction has not changed.
	- Borrower represents that it has the power to own its assets and carry on its business.
- Binding obligations
	- Borrower confirms that obligations it undertakes in the facility agreement and associated documents are legal, valid, binding, and enforceable. Common to qualify this representation by general principles limiting the borrower's obligations.  
- Non-conflict
	- Borrower must state that entering into the facility agreement will not conflict with any laws or regulations, their constitutional documents, or any other agreement or instrument to which they are a party.
		- Practically, the bank does not want the borrower to immediately default on another contract.
		- Legally, if entering the loan causes the borrower to breach an existing contract, the other party to that contract might sue the bank in tort for ‘procuring a breach of contractual relations’ (or ‘interference with contractual relations’).
		- So the bank should ensure this does not just protect material breaches.
- Power and authority
	- Borrower represents that it has the power and authority to enter into the loan and perform its obligations. Breach will lead to default, which allows the bank to refuse advances or demand repayment.
- Validity and admissibility in evidence
	- Borrower represents that it has done everything required to ensure the facility agreement is admissible in evidence in its jurisdiction of incorporation.
- Governing law and enforcement.
	- Representation that the law governing the facility agreement and any judgment obtained will be recognised and enforced in the borrower's jurisdiction of incorporation.

### Commercial Representations

- Deduction of tax
	- Borrower represents that it is not required to deduct tax from payments made to banks define as “Qualifying Lenders” (those exempt from withholding tax). Not repeated: ongoing tax issues dealt with separately.
- No filing or stamp duties
	- Stamp duty is imposed on the transfer of ‘stock’, ‘marketable securities’ and ‘interests in partnership’, with rates ranging from 0.5% to 1.5% of the consideration or market value of the property being transferred (known as *ad valorem* stamp duty).
	- Failure to pay stamp duty within 30 days of execution will usually mean that the document is not admissible in evidence or accepted for registration purposes.
	- Not usually payable on a loan facility, but represented to protect against possible foreign duties.
- No event of default
	- Borrower represents that there is no **event of default** continuing, or which might reasonably be expected to occur as a result of utilising the facility.
	- Borrower represents that there is no **event of default** under any other of its agreements which would have a material adverse effect.
		- Negotiation will focus on narrowing the definition of material adverse effect.
		- Repeated representation.
- No misleading information
	- Borrower represents that it has not supplied information to the bank which is misleading.
		- Information provided for the information memorandum true and accurate
		- Financial projections prepared by the company's directors based on recent information and contain reasonable assumptions
		- All other information provided to banks was true, complete, and accurate.
	- Borrower will want the representation to apply only to written information provided.
	- Borrower will want representation qualified to information that was “true and accurate in all material respects”.
	- Not necessary to repeat.
- Accounting principles
	- Borrower represents that the original financial statements it provided to the bank were prepared in accordance with the relevant GAAP, consistently applied, and give a ‘true and fair view’.
	- Borrower undertakes to deliver future accounts on the same basis, with a proviso to deal with any change in policies.
	- Borrower represents that there has been no material adverse change in its business or financial condition since a set of financial statements.
		- Usually not repeated if the facility has a material adverse change event of default.
		- If repeated, does it refer to a material adverse change from the original financial statements or the latest financial statements? Negotiate.
- Ranking
	- Borrower represents that any claims the bank may have under the loan documentation will rank at least *pari passu* (equally) with any other unsecured creditors, other than as a result of any preference through insolvency regulations.
	- Under English law, this is the default legal position. Protects banks against a change in the law and protects against foreign jurisdiction practices.
- Litigation
	- Borrower represents that it faces no current or threatened litigation – though this is likely to be qualified by materiality/ de minimis/ excluding frivolous and vexatious claims or to refer to the “reasonably likely outcome”.
	- Litigation representations likely to include claims against the borrower group's directors (derivative claims).
- Winding-up proceedings
	- Borrower represents that no insolvency proceedings in any form have been started or are threatened against the borrower.
	- Borrower should press for de minimis provision and wording to exclude debts which it disputes in good faith.
	- Usually repeated
- Encumbrances
	- Borrower represents that there are no encumbrances other than those disclosed before execution.
		- Even though the bank will have done a company search on the borrower and examined its register of mortgages and charges.
	- Bank represents that it has valid title in its own name to all property over which security is granted.
	- Not usually repeated
- Environmental
	- If the borrower breaches environmental laws, its lender may also incur direct liability (‘lender liability’) if it is found to have ‘knowingly permitted’ contamination or if it takes possession of contaminated land.
	- Borrower represents that it is in compliance with all environmental laws and has obtained and complies with all environmental licences necessary for its business.
	- Often subject to materiality and not typically repeated (environmental undertaking used instead).
- Catch all
	- Banks may try to include such a clause; borrower typically resists.

### Disclosure Letter

- The bank's solicitor will draft the representations as widely as possible.
- Borrower forced to disclose instances in which the representation is not true.
	- These could be included as a specific exception.
	- Neater to keep the representation “clean” and use a separate document to deal with anything which would otherwise be a breach – the disclosure letter. List of agreed specific items which the bank has agreed to waive.
- Disclosures should be worded to modify all representations.

### Repetition of Representations

Representations may be “evergreen” - deemed repeated every day throughout the life of the loan. More common for representations to be repeated immediately prior to each utilisation and on the first day of each interest period.

To prevent the borrower arguing that the representations were merely initial pre-conditions of lending:

- Loan document may specifically state that the representations are to survive the execution and first utilisation.
- A certificate by the borrower to be periodically provided confirming that the representations are still correct.

This also helps prove reliance on a future misrepresentation claim. Reliance will be harder to show from a deemed representation.

## Bank's Perspective

Some representations are best cast in general terms due to caveat emptor. Representations are about risk allocation, allowing the bank to take action. So don't give in to blanket qualifications for most terms.

## Borrower's Perspective

Borrower will want to negotiate wide margins of error.

> [!warning]
> - A borrower should not repeat a representation that there is no "potential event of default", since breach would turn a potential into a full default. 
> - The disclosure letter is effective only on the first instance. If a representation is repeated, the disclosure letter is no longer effective.  

The bank will strongly resist wording that representations are qualified with “to the best of our knowledge and belief”, since this defeats the point.

Borrowers may want to negotiate a materiality qualification, should ensure that the qualification is certain enough to actually be used (e.g., a *de minimus* amount of money). This clause can also be used to restrict the companies in the borrower's group to which a representation applies (e.g., material subsidiaries).

## Contract Law

A representation is a statement of fact, made to induce the party to whom it is addressed to enter into a contract. The statement may be oral or written, and if it is drafted into the contract, it also becomes a term of that contract. If the statement is untrue, it constitutes misrepresentation.

Term | Definition
---|---
Representation | A statement asserting the truth of a given state of facts
Representor | The party who allegedly made the representation
Representee | The party who allegedly received the representation
[[Actionable representation]] | An unambiguous false statement of fact made to the claimant and which induces the claimant to enter into the contract with the statement maker

### Misrepresentation Sequence

1. Identify potential misrepresentation (common sense)
2. Identify if the potential misrepresentation is an [[Actionable representation]]
3. Categorise into one of the [[Misrepresentation categories]]
4. Consider which of the [[Misrepresentation remedies]] to apply
5. Consider if any [[Misrepresentation alternative claims]] apply

Category | Legal basis | Test | Rescission? | Indemnity? | Damages
---|---|---|---|---|---
Fraudulent | Tort of deceit | Representee to prove that representor made the statement knowing it was untrue/ without believing it to be true/ reckless as to the truth | Yes | Unlikely to be needed | Yes, generous [[Tort Law/Remoteness]] rules, no reduction for contributory negligence
Negligent | s 2(1) MA 1967 | Representor fails to show reasonable grounds to believe true/ not believing true up until contract made | Yes | Unlikely to be needed | As for fraud, but potential reduction for contributory negligence. Can also be given in lieu of rescission.
Innocent | s 2(1) MA 1967 | Representor has shown reasonable grounds to believe, and actual belief up until contract made | Yes | Yes, as part of rescission | Can be given in lieu of rescission.

### Actionable Representation

Examining each component in more detail:

### Unambiguous

The representation must be clear and will only form the basis of a claim in misrepresentation if it unambiguously has the meaning put forward by the representee.

Representor will not be liable if the representee has placed its own unreasonable construction on the representation ([[McInerny v Lloyd's Bank Ltd [1974] 1 Lloyd's Rep 246]]).

### False

The statement must be false; it will not be false if it is substantially correct

> “[A] representation may be true without being entirely correct, provided it is substantially correct and the difference between what is represented and what is actually correct would not have been likely to induce a reasonable person in the position of the claimants to enter into the contracts”  
> [[Rix J, Avon Insurance Plc v Swire Fraser Ltd [2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 573]].

### Statement of Fact

> 'A representation is not an undertaking to do, or not to do, something. It is a statement asserting a given state of affairs'  
> [[Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Malaysia Mining Corp [1989] 1 WLR 379]]

Includes | Does not include
---|---
Statements of fact | Statements of opinion
Some conduct | Statements of intention
Statements of law | Silence

#### Facts Vs Puff

Representations distinguished from mere 'puff' ([[Dimmock v Hallett (1866) LR 2 Ch App 21]]).

#### Conduct

Statements usually made by words, but can also be made by conduct ([[Gordon v Selico (1986) 278 EG 53]] concealment of dry rot).

#### Statement of Law

Traditional rule was that a statement of law could not give rise to an actionable misrepresentation. But the distinction between statements of fact and law has been abolished. It was held that a false statement as to the existence of an Act of Parliament is a misrepresentation of fact ([[West London Commercial Bank v Kitson (1884) LR 13 QBD 360]]).

#### Statement of Opinion

##### General Rule

A statement of opinion is not a statement of fact, so cannot usually form the basis of a claim in misrepresentation (e.g., [[Bisset v Wilkinson [1927] AC 1977]]).

##### Exceptions

When someone expresses an opinion, they impliedly state they know the facts justifying that opinion. When the same facts are known to each party, the implicit statement is unlikely to have much impact on the representee. But if the representor has greater knowledge than the representee, the implied statement that there are facts justifying the opinion can significantly mislead the representee ([[Smith v Land and House Property Corporation (1885) LR 28 Ch D 7 (CA)]]).

Where the representor is in a position of superior knowledge or experience, a statement of opinion can be held to involve a statement of fact that there are reasonable grounds for their opinion. So if there are no reasonable grounds for this opinion (i.e., the opinion is one which someone with the knowledge of the representor could not reasonably have held) then a false statement has been made ([[Esso v Mardon [1976] QB 801]]).

There is also an implied statement in an expression of opinion that the representor believes the opinion that they express. If this is not the case, such a representation will be a misrepresentation.

#### Statement of Future Intention

Representation is a statement of fact, so can have no reference to future events or promises.

>“There is a clear difference between a representation of fact and a representation that something will be done in the future. A representation that something will be done in the future cannot be true or false at the moment it is made; and although you may call it a representation, if anything it is a contract or promise”  
>[[Beattie v Ebury (1872) LR 7 Ch App 777]], per Mellish LJ.

Consequently, it is not a misrepresentation if the representor makes a promise regarding a future intention, but is prevented from doing so or if circumstances alter so that they change their mind about that intention ([[Wales v Wadham [1977] 1 WLR 199]]).

However, if the representor states they intend to do something, they are making a limited statement of fact: stating they do have that intention. So if, at that time, they know they cannot do what they state, or do not intend to do it, they are misrepresenting their existing intention ([[Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459]]).

Bowen LJ:

>“The state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion…”

#### Silence

Silence will generally not give rise to an action for misrepresentation. No general duty to disclose facts which, if known, might affect the other party's decision to enter the contract ([[Keates v The Earl of Cadogan (1851) 10 CB 591]]).

But there are some exceptions to the rule in Keates:

##### Half-truths

It is a misrepresentation to make statements which are technically true but misleading ([[Nottingham Patent Brick & Tile Co v Butler (1866)]]). e.g., to describe property which is the subject of negotiations for sale as 'fully let' without disclosing that, although the property is indeed fully let at that time, the tenants have given notice to quit, is a misrepresentation ([[Dimmock v Hallett (1866) LR 2 Ch App 21]]).

##### Continuing Representation

If, at the beginning of negotiations, a statement is made which is true but which prior to entering into the contract becomes false, the representor is under an obligation to correct the representation. If they fail to do so and allow the other party to enter into the contract still believing that the representation is true, then they will be liable for misrepresentation ([[With v O'Flanagan [1936] Ch 575]]). This is the principle of 'continuing representations'.

##### Contracts Uberrimae Fidei (utmost Good faith)

There is a duty to disclose material facts in some types of contracts in which one party is in a particularly strong position to know the material facts which form the basis of the contract. Most common is contract of insurance: at common law, disclosure of all material facts must be made to the insurer. Also, often this obligation to disclose information exists between parties which are in a fiduciary relationship (e.g., between a company and its directors, between a trustee and beneficiaries of a trust).

### Addressed to the Claimant

The misrepresentation must be addressed by the representor to the claimant.

### Induces the Claimant to Enter into the Contract with Statement Maker

Requirement not satisfied in [[JEB Fasteners v Mark Bloom [1983] 1 All ER 583]], where the Court of Appeal held that the defendants' representation did not play a 'real and substantial' part in inducing the claimants to act.

Court asks:

> Was the representation material?

Objective test for this: did the statement relate to an issue that would have influenced a reasonable person ([[Pan Atlantic Co Ltd v Pine Top Insurance Co Ltd [1995] 1 AC 501]])?

- If a statement is found to be material, then inducement will generally be inferred as a matter of fact ([[Smith v Chadwick (1884) 9 App Cas 187]]). Then burden shift to the defendant to rebut the inference that the claimant was induced. This is done by proving that the claimant was not subjectively induced.
- If a statement is not found to be material, then inducement of the claimant cannot be inferred as a matter of fact. The claimant must prove that they were subjectively induced. If they do this successfully, it will be held that they have been induced by the misrepresentation ([[Museprime Properties Ltd v Adhill Properties Ltd (1990) 61 P. & C.R. 111]]).

MERMAID1

Since the representation must have induced the representee to enter the contract, there is no actionable misrepresentation where:

- the statement was not actually communicated to the representee;
- the statement did not affect the representee's decision to enter the contract
- the statement was known to be untrue by the representee.

The misrepresentation need not be the only reason the claimant entered the contract ([[Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459]]).

A representor may seek to argue that the representee was not induced where the representee chooses to test the validity of the representor's statement by making its own investigations ([[Attwood v Small (1838) 6 CL & F 232]]).

The key point in Attwood is not that separate enquiries were made or could have been made — the crucial point is that the separate enquiries showed that the vendor's statements were not relied upon ([[Redgrave v Hurd (1881) 20 Ch D 1]]). This case also established that there is no general duty to check the misrepresentor's statement.

If a representee does not check, where the court considers it reasonable for them to have done so, or carries out a negligent investigation, this would open up the possibility of a defence of [[Contributory negligence]] against the representee. This cannot be pleaded where the misrepresentation is fraudulent. The more commercial the representee is, the more likely it is that the court will consider it reasonable for the representee to have investigated (by analogy to [[Smith v Eric Bush [1990] 1 AC 831]]).

### Categories of Misrepresentation

Once the elements of an actionable misrepresentation have been established, the remedies available depend on the category of the misrepresentation in question.

Under [Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/7), the categories of misrepresentation available are:

Category | Legal basis | Test
---|---|---
Fraudulent | Tort of deceit | Representee to prove that representor made the statement knowing it was untrue/ without believing it to be true/ reckless as to the truth
Negligent | s 2(1) MA 1967 | Representor fails to show reasonable grounds to believe true/ not believing true up until contract made
Innocent | s 2(1) MA 1967 | Representor has shown reasonable grounds to believe, and actual belief up until contract made

#### Fraudulent Misrepresentation

Defined by Lord Herschell in [[Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 337]]:

>"First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made (a) knowingly, or (b) without belief in its truth, or (c) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states…Thirdly, if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial. It matters not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the statement was made."

'Recklessness' was defined in [[Thomas Witter Ltd v TBP Industries Ltd [1996] 2 All ER 573]], where it was established that to find fraud, the level of recklessness required was 'flagrant disregard for the truth'.

##### Change in Circumstances

It can be difficult categorising a misrepresentation based on change of circumstances. Lord Wright MR in [[With v O'Flanagan [1936] Ch 575]]:

>“…the Court is more reluctant to use the word “fraud” and would not generally use the word “fraud” in that connection because the failure to disclose, though wrong and a breach of duty, may be due to inadvertence or a failure to realise that the duty rests upon the party who has made the representation not to leave the other party under an error when the representation has become falsified by a change of circumstances”

So the Court would need to be satisfied that failure to disclose was deliberate/dishonest.

##### Burden of Proof

The burden of proof on the claimant to prove fraudulent representation is a difficult burden to discharge: allegations of fraud taken very seriously.

#### Negligent Misrepresentation

Section 2(1) of the MA 1967 provides:

>“Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.”

So defendant liable for negligent misrepresentation unless they can prove they had reasonable grounds to believe, and did believe up until the time of the contract, that the statement was true.

Where a representor is found liable for a negligent misrepresentation, they will be treated to all intents and purposes as if he had made a fraudulent misrepresentation ([[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson [1991] 2 QB 297]] but widely criticised). This has ramifications for damages.

See also [[Howard Marine and Dredging Co. Ltd. v A. Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd. [1978] 2 WLR 515]].

Important to note that the statutory right to damages for negligent misrepresentation reverses the normal burden of proof by requiring the representor (defendant) to prove that they had reasonable grounds to believe their statement, and did believe their statement.

Note that it is difficult for a defendant to get their misrepresentation downgraded from negligent to innocent, because the courts want to discourage people from making statements without checking/ thinking about their validity.

#### Innocent Misrepresentation

An innocent misrepresentation is one which is not made fraudulently or negligently. It is a statement made where the representor:

- Proves they had reasonable grounds for belief in the truth of their statement
- Proves that they believed up to the time of contract that what they were saying is true.

It is defined in s 2(1)[Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/7).

### Remedies for Misrepresentation

#### Rescission

Misrepresentation renders the contract voidable. So the contract is still valid and subsisting until the representee decides to rescind it. Available for any type of representation.

General rule: in order to rescind, the representee must communicate the intention to do so to the representor. Or may initiate proceedings for the rescission of the contract.

This is an equitable remedy, so given or withheld at the discretion of the court. Generally only awarded where parties can be restored to their original position. Reasons why potentially not awarded:

- Affirmation
	- Representee declaring intention to affirm, or doing some act from which such intention may reasonably be inferred.
- Lapse of time
	- Delay defeats equity
	- Lapse of time without attempt to effect rescission not itself affirmation, but could be treated as evidence for such an intention
- Restitution impossible
	- *restitutio in integrum* no longer possible ([[Clarke v Dickson (1858) EB & E 148]])
- Third party rights accrue
	- The contract remains valid up until the time notice is given of the intention to rescind. So at any time prior to rescission, a person acquiring goods under such a contract is able to pass good title to those goods to an innocent third party, who purchases the goods without notice of the misrepresentation.
	- This would prevent restitution

#### Indemnity

As part of the equitable process of rescission, an indemnity may be awarded to cover expenses for obligations assumed as a direct result of the contract. The obligations must have been created by the contract.

Generally, where an action for misrepresentation will give a right to damages, an indemnity will not be awarded. No damages are available for an innocent misrepresentation, so here an action of indemnity is more likely to be awarded. Note the distinction between an indemnity and the common law right to damages ([[Whittington v Seale‑Hayne (1900) 82 LT 49]]).

#### Damages

Damages are potentially the greatest where the misrepresentation is fraudulent. But damages for an action for negligent misrepresentation will under s 2(1) MA 1967 often match those available for fraudulent misrepresentation. Damages in lieu of rescission may be available under s 2(2) MA 1967.

Innocent misrepresentation does not afford any damages per se, but damages in lieu of rescission may be available under s 2(2) MA 1967.

Negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent misrepresentation both entitle the innocent party to damages, under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, s 2(1) and the tort of deceit respectively. In both cases, however, any damages will be on a tortious basis and, therefore, a bank would get no compensation for loss of bargain or profit (see [[Smith New Court Securities Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd [1997] AC 254, HL]]).

#### Damages for Fraudulent Misrepresentation

Fraudulent misrepresentation is part of the tort of deceit, so damages will be calculated on a tortious basis. The measure of damages is that which is necessary to place the innocent injured party in the position they would have been in had the misrepresentation not been made.

Held in [[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158]] that claimant can recover

>“…all the damage directly flowing from the tortious act of fraudulent inducement which was not rendered too remote by the plaintiff's own conduct, whether or not the defendant could have foreseen the loss.”

Requirements have since been added:

- That the claimant must mitigate as soon as the fraud is discovered
- That any damages awarded to the claimant will be reduced by the value of any benefit the claimant has acquired as a result of the contract

[[Contributory negligence]] is **not** available as a defence to a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation ([[Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (No.2) [2003] 1 AC 959]]).

#### Damages for Negligent Misrepresentation

##### S 2(1) Damages

 s 2(1) CA 1967:

> “Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.”

In [[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson [1991] 2 QB 297]] the court confirmed that the effect of this statute is that the correct measure of damages for negligent misrepresentation must be based on the tort of deceit (not the tort of negligence). This implies that the claimant is entitled to recover all losses, even if those losses are unforeseeable. Note that this draws no distinction between the honest and careless representor, and the fraudulent representor (which is criticised). But for negligent misrepresentation, damages may be reduced for [[Contributory negligence]].

##### S 2(2) Damages

 s 2(2) CA 1967:

 > “Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than fraudulently, and he would be entitled by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract, then, if it is claimed, in any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded, the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, if of the opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.”

Remedy of damages in lieu of rescission only available at the discretion of the court, and only available for negligent and innocent misrepresentation.

The court must consider various factors ([[UCB Corporate Services v Thomason [2005] 1 All ER (Comm) 601]]):

- The nature and seriousness of the misrepresentation
- The loss that would be caused if the contract were upheld
- The loss that rescission would cause the other party

##### Distinction

Note that s 2(2) damages are a separate award of damages to those awarded under s 2(1)

Damages awarded | Rationale
---|---
s 2(1) damages | Intended to compensate the claimant for the loss directly flowing from the negligent misrepresentation.
s 2(2) damages | Intended to compensate the representee where the court has decided, at its discretion, not to award rescission.

Where damages in lieu of rescission are awarded, the damages awarded under s 2(1) will be reduced to reflect those awarded under s 2(2) (as explained by s 2(3))

#### Damages for Innocent Misrepresentation

Where an innocent misrepresentation has been made, the representee is only entitled to the remedy of rescission and, if applicable, an indemnity to cover the cost of the legal obligations arising from the contract entered into. There is no automatic right to damages for an innocent misrepresentation. But, as with negligent misrepresentation, the court has the discretion under s 2(2) to award damages in lieu of rescission. Note [[Contributory negligence]] cannot be claimed for innocent misrepresentation.

#### Misrepresentation and Exemption Clauses

If a contract contains [[Exemption Clauses]] purporting to protect a party from liability for misrepresenting, or purporting to exclude or restrict any remedy available to the other party, the clause will be of no effect except in so far as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness (s 3 MA 1967 as substituted by s 8 [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]]). The requirement of reasonableness comes from [s 11(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/section/11).

#### Non-reliance Clauses

It is doubtful whether an 'entire agreement' clause would be sufficient to exclude liability for any misrepresentation. A possible boilerplate clause excluding this liability could be

> The parties agree and confirm that neither party has made any representations to the other in relation to this contract or its subject matter, and neither has any party relied on any representation from the other in entering into this contract.

The court will not allow liability for fraudulent misrepresentation to be avoided in this way.

### Hedley Byrne V Heller

There is a claim for negligent misstatement in the law of tort, based on the judgment in [[Hedley Byrne v Heller [1964] AC 465]]. This depends on there being a relationship between two parties that gives rise to a duty of care. The rule in Hedley Byrne v Heller is, however, eclipsed by the Misrepresentation Act 1967 in a situation of inducement to contract, because the onus of proof in the latter is more favourable to a claimant.

### Facility Agreement

The most important remedies for misleading and inaccurate information are built into the facility agreement, typically as events of default. The general law on misrepresentations is therefore only relevant in the unlikely event that a material representation was not caught by the facility agreement, or the facility agreement was unenforceable.

> [!tip]
> The ultimate remedy appropriate for breach of representation in a Facilities Agreement is the immediate repayment of the Loan, together with interest and any other amounts outstanding under the Agreement. Damages aren't really relevant. 

# Undertakings

Aim: to give the lender control over the borrower once the agreement is executed, to protect the loan monies.

## Form and Purpose

Promise given by the bank to the borrower. May involve a promise to do/ not to something, or to procure that something is done/ not done by a third party within the borrower's control.

Categories:

1. Financial covenants
	- Financial targets which the borrower is required to meet during the life of the loan
	- Relate to profit, cash flow or net worth.
2. Information undertakings
	- Promises the provide the bank with certain information.
3. General undertakings
	- e.g., by prohibiting disposals, maintaining insurance and sticking to the key business.

> [!warning]
> Breach of an undertaking is made an event of default, allowing the bnak to cancel its commitment and demand repayment. 

## Undertaking Vs Representation

Undertakings can often be recast as repeat representations (just stating the fact).

In either case, the likely result of the breach is an event of default. But preferable to get a borrower to represent the position at signing and also undertake to maintain the position throughout the term of the loan.

> [!tip]
> This results in a "tighter" constraint: the borrower is in default immediately as the undertaking is broken, rather than a repeating representation being tested at the time of repetition (typically at the start of every interest period). 

Also gives more flexibility: can make the representation more strict than the subsequent undertaking.

- Breach of representation may give remedies under Misrepresentation Act 1967;
- Breach of an undertaking may give remedies of specific performance/ injunction.
- Courts will not order specific performance where damages are an adequate remedy (almost always for a facility agreement).

## Financial Covenants

Undertakings which impose financial targets/ limitations on the borrower. Common for leveraged finance, unusual for investment grade borrowers. Two broad types: maintenance covenants and incurrence covenants.

### Maintenance Covenants

They require the borrower to maintain a specified level of financial performance and are tested regularly over the life of the loan facility. Measure past performance, not future prospects.

### Incurrence Covenants

Also set financial targets, but borrower must show compliance only if it wants to do specific things (e.g., dispose of large assets, acquire new companies, pay dividends).

If these are not done, the covenants are not incurred (not tested). Originated from high yield bonds.

### Limits and Ratios

Some financial covenants simply set a financial limit which a borrower must attain. More common to consider ratios.

#### Leverage Ratio

$$
\text{Net Debt} : \text{EBITDA}
$$

- Compares debt to earnings (profit) over a period (e.g., a year).
- Net debt
	- Debt defined as commercial borrowing, not short-term trade creditors.
	- Net debt is gross debt – freely available cash held
	- May be consolidated across a group.
- EBITDA
	- Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
	- Measure of profit.
	- Exceptional items typically excluded
	- Typical acquisition financing have a ratio of 4:1, 5:1.
	- Leverage ratio also called a "debt cover ratio". Different from gearing, which is $\text{Net Debt} : \text{Net Worth}$.

#### Interest Cover Ratio

$$
\text{EBITDA} : \text{Net Finance Charges}
$$

- Borrowers ability to cover the interest payment and fee obligations under its borrowing.
- Net Finance Charges exclude capital repayments.
- Any interest earned by the borrower from its investments is usually deducted from interest payable.
- ~ 2 : 1

#### Cashflow Cover Ratio

$$
\text{Cashflow} : \text{Net Debt Service}
$$

- Also known as “fixed charge cover”/ “debt service cover”
- Ability of a borrower to generate enough cash to pay all amounts due under its borrowing.
- Cashflow
	- Definition starts with EBITDA and then adjusts items included and excluded to represent cash movements more closely.
	- Starting point for whether the bank thinks the borrower has more cash than needed to run its business. Excess cash is often taken and used to prepay the loan in a “cash sweep”.
- Net debt service
	- Includes fees and interest payments due under commercial borrowing, but also any capital payments due
- ~ 1:1

#### Minimum Net Worth

 - A minimum net worth financial covenant aims to ensure the company maintains a minimum value of assets in the business.
 - The definition of net worth will vary.
 - Intended to represent the difference between assets and liabilities of the borrower.
 - Starting point: paid-up share capital + any reserves (shareholder funds in the balance sheet)
 - Most calculations exclude intangible assets. These include:
	 - Goodwill
	 - Capitalised R&D costs
		 - R&D usually entered as an expense
		 - May be lumped together and treated as an asset if it is reasonably certain that they will be recovered once the product is developed.
		 - Capitalised amount amortised to spread the cost over time as a form of accrual.
	- Patents, copyrights, licences etc.
		- Often not transferrable, worth little on insolvency
	- Payments on account
		- Excluded since they wold need to be repaid if the borrower did not perform.
	- Unaudited revaluation
		- To avoid the borrower over-inflating its value.
	- Tax provisions
		- Money set aside to pay taxes.

#### Capital Expenditure

Puts a limit on the amount which the borrower can spend on “long-term” business assets over a given period. Helps to retain cash to service the debt. Colloquially, “capex” provision.

#### Borrowing

Bank limits a borrower's exposure to other creditors. May be achieved through a financial covenant capping total borrowings. Might be linked to tangible net worth. Transactions likely to be included in the expanded definition of “borrowing”:

- Financial leases and instalment credit options.
	- Lesee will usually be required over the life of the lease to pay instalments to the lessor equivalent to the full value of the leased asset, together with a return on the capital value.
	- Lesee usually responsible for maintaining the asset.
	- Commonly used to fund computer hardware/ heavy machinery/ aircraft.
- Deferred purchase agreements
	- Buy now pay later
- Capital instruments
	- Bonds, notes, commercial paper.
- Guarantees and indemnities
	- Financial assurance given by the borrower in respect of any transaction.

When defining ratios, define terms specifically rather than relying on standard terminology.

### Information for Testing

- All companies must produce year end accounts
- Listed companies must produce interim accounts (unaudited) for first 6 months of their financial year.
- To test more than twice a year: bank can require B to supply a “compliance certificate” signed by 2 directors, confirming the financial covenants have been met on the requisite date. Usually accompanies by financial statements covering the period.

### GAAP and Accounting

B usually allowed to follow changes to GAAP as long as auditors provide a description of changes necessary to “convert” the statements to the original policies (“frozen GAAP” provision). Usually a provision for parties to negotiate re-setting the covenants, to avoid frozen GAAP becoming a big burden.

### Equity Cure

Borrowers traditionally could not “cure” a breach of financial covenants. Strong equity sponsors (PE firms etc.) have negotiated a right to inject cash into the borrower to help it meet financial covenants, either by prepayment or putting money into an account.

Equity sponsors would prefer to treat the new cash as EBITDA, but rarely given. Usually treated as positive cash flow.

## Information Undertakings

Effectiveness of most provisions depends on the bank receiving a regular supply of information from the borrower.

### Financial Information

Used to monitor the borrower's financial wellbeing and check for any breaches of financial covenants. Main sources:

1. Year end accounts (and possibly interims/ pro forma quarterlies), included consolidated accounts.
2. Management accounts (unpublished pro forma accounts for internal use).
3. Forecast of borrower performance, usually in the form of a projected balance statement.
4. Certificate showing compliance with all financial covenants
5. "Sweep-up" provision, any other information relating to financial condition which the bank requests. Borrower should negotiate this subject to no material cost (at least prior to default).

### Shareholder Documents

Often restricted to information which borrower is required by statute to send to shareholders.

### KYC

Undertaking by borrower to supply information reasonably requested by any lender in order to fulfil ongoing KYC obligations – this is standard. Borrower may ask to limit this to information within their possession and control, or which they can obtain with reasonable endeavours.

### Insurance

Maintaining adequate insurance for major assets – even if loan unsecured. Often coupled with undertakings to notify bank of material changes to insurance cover and produce copies of policies if requested.

### Notification of Default

Borrower to notify the bank if it defaults under the loan, and possibly also any “potential” events of default which might occur. This should be carefully defined.

Written confirmation to be given by directors at bank's request, confirming there has been no default or potential event of default.

## General Undertakings

Can be positive or negative promises.

### Positive Undertakings

- Insurance
	- Keep major assets insured.
	- Can also include "keyman" insurance (insurance for if key personnel leave the company, where the business is small). If the key man dies, lump sum paid to borrower.
- Consents, licences and laws
	- Undertaking that borrower maintain all necessary consents, authorisations and licences to perform its obligations under the loan document.
- Access to information and assistance
	- Very occasionally, bank allowed to inspect books/ records/ assets. Should be at reasonable notice and within office hours.

### Negative Undertakings

Prohibit borrower from doing something.

#### Negative Pledge

- Undertaking by the borrower not to create any security over its assets.
- Standard if borrower is unsecured, often insisted upon even if the bank has security, to protect the bank's floating charge security.
- Borrower may want to negotiate exceptions:
	- Security necessary under equipment leasing/ hire purchase agreements
	- Liens arising in the ordinary course of business (e.g., asset retained by third party until payment for services). Bank may restrict to a time period.
	- Cash collateralisation necessary for business
	- Security pre-dating the facility
	- Security acquired through purchasing asset/ business which is already subject to a security
	- Netting (“set-off”) arrangements between group companies
	- Retention of title clauses.
	- Project finance. Banks will usually want security over the asset being funded.
	- De minimis amount (“basket”) allowing a minimum amount of debt for which the borrower may create security.
- Often wording attempts to create security for the ban automatically in the event of a breach. Doubts over whether this is effective in English law.

#### Pari Passu Ranking

- The claims of the bank rank at least pari passu with the claims of all other present or future unsecured and subordinated creditors, except for those preferred by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar laws.
- Tries to ensure bank is not subordinated to unsecured creditors. Repeated representation often used here.

#### Disposals and Acquisitions

- Restriction/ prohibition on disposal of assets other than those in the ordinary course of trading/ in exchange for comparable assets.
- May allow disposal of obsolete assets.
- The clause might allow disposals at arm’s length up to a maximum aggregate annual value (a ‘basket’), or be tied in to mandatory prepayment.
- Restriction from substantial acquisitions/ mergers
- Undertaking that there will not be a substantial change to the general nature of the business.

#### Lending

- Carries the risk of non-repayment and a depletion of assets.
- Typically, an undertaking not to lend must be given, other than in the ordinary course of business/ within the group.

#### Shares and Dividends

- Undertaking not to make any distribution to shareholders without the bank's consent/ meeting of a financial test.
- The bank may agree that the undertaking will not apply to the borrower's subsidiaries.
- Take care if the borrower has issued any preference shares – giving such an undertaking may result in a breach of contract.
- If the borrower has subsidiaries, the bank may require the borrower to undertake not to allow subsidiaries to issue shares to third parties.

#### Auditors

- Any contractual clause that restricts an audited person's choice of auditor has no legal effect.
- Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 2016

#### Persons with Significant Control

- Register of individuals and entities must be kept.
- If a company fails to comply with this ‘people with significant control’ regime, the sanctions may prevent security being taken or enforced over the company’s shares. Secured facilities will therefore usually include an undertaking that the group companies will comply with the relevant requirements.

## Bank's Perspective

Choice of undertakings depends on the context of the loan.

When drafting, take care of “shadow director” provisions. If a bank uses the undertakings in its facility agreement to force a borrower to take certain action, it seems possible that the bank might be a ‘shadow director’. The time of greatest risk is usually when a borrower is in financial difficulties.

A shadow director may be held liable for wrongful trading under the IA 1986, s 214(7), and may have to contribute to a company’s assets on its liquidation.

### Borrower's Perspective

Provision of financial projections and management accounts can be v time-consuming if not already part of the directors' remit. Borrower's solicitor will need to ensure undertakings are not too tight. Insert “reasonable” wherever possible. Try to negotiate “cure” periods for as many breaches as possible. Try to get references to subsidiaries changed to “material subsidiaries”.

# Events of Default

Dictate the circumstances in which a bank can terminate its loan early or take other action. Usually very heavily negotiated.

## Purpose

If a provision of an agreement is breached, the injured party may seek remedy for breach of contract. The remedy available will depend on the time of term breached:

1. **Conditions**. Terms which are fundamental to a contract. Breach of a condition may allow the injured party to terminate the contract and claim damages, or to affirm the contract and claim damages.
2. **Warranties**. Warranties are terms which are not considered fundamental to the contract. Breach of a warranty will not allow the injured party to terminate the contract, but merely to claim damages for any loss arising from the breach.
3. **Intermediate (or innominate) terms**. Intermediate terms which are capable of being breached either in a trivial, or in a fundamental way. The remedy available on the breach of an intermediate term will be either damages, or damages and termination, depending on the effect of the breach on the contract.

MERMAID2

If a party makes a false representation to induce the other party into contract, the remedies for misrepresentation may be available.

Events of default provide the bank with a contractual right suspend/ cancel a commitment, put the loan on demand or immediately demand repayment (acceleration). Means the bank does not have to rely on statutory/ common law remedies.

## Common Events of Default

### Late Payment

- Most important event of default.
- Banks are highly sensitive about **punctual payment** by the borrower.
- A bank will require default **interest** to be paid on the overdue amount.
- General requirement to **indemnify** the bank against any costs associated with the default.
- Missed payment probably signals cash flow problems in the business.
- Default for late payment will be **non-negotiable**. Will cover late payment as well as interest and repayments of principal.
- Bank may allow the borrower a short **grace period** to rectify any accidental late payment/ late payment due to technical issues.
- Bank will ensure that any default interest and indemnity provisions run **from the date from which payment is overdue**, not from the end of any grace period.

### Breach of Representation

- Default for an incorrect/ misleading written representation often **drafted widely**.
- Bank may concede that the requirement should be **material**/ have material adverse effect.

### Breach of Undertaking

- Expressed as an explicit event of default
- May be a **grace period/ materiality** qualification.

### Breach of Financial Covenants

- Some equity sponsors manage to negotiate “**equity cure**” rights to avoid a default on breach of a financial covenant.
- Another concession is a **“Mulligan” provision**. Works to either
	- Prevent the bank calling an event of default unless the borrower breaches a financial covenant on **two consecutive testing dates** (true Mulligan); or
	- Allow the bank to call a default on the first breach of a financial covenant, but to **lose that right** if it fails to call a default **before** the borrower meets the financial covenant on the **subsequent test date** (not a true Mulligan).

### Cross-default

- Key event of default, heavily negotiated.
- If a borrower **defaults on another loan or contract**, the other party may force terms on the borrower $\rightarrow$ prejudices the lending bank.
- A cross-default clause operates by **automatically defaulting** the borrower under the loan in the event that it defaults under certain other types of agreement.
- Ensures the bank can protect its position and possibly accelerate the loan.
- Effectively gives a bank the benefit of the default provisions in other agreements to which the borrower is a party.
- Usually limited by
	- being confined to defaults which occur under other documents providing ‘**financial indebtedness**’; and
	- including a ***de minimus* threshold**.  
- The borrower may also negotiate:
	- That the cross-default will operate only if the other default will have a **material** effect on its ability to perform its obligations under the facility agreement.
	- That the cross-default will **trigger at a specific point** in the initial default (e.g. failure to pay amount due, creditor demands early repayment, creditor exercises a right to demand early repayment – "**cross-acceleration**").
		- Cross-acceleration is the most desirable for the borrower.
		- But the bank will be concerned that the borrower will favour the party with the benefit of default to persuade them not to accelerate.
	- Carve out for defaults which the borrower is **disputing in good faith**. Strongly resisted by most banks.
- The bank may want cross-default provision to extend to **other companies in the group**.
	- Borrower can try to limit this to **material or principal subsidiaries**.

The bank has an **evidential problem** in finding out when a borrower has defaulted under another agreement. The borrower breaching a representation will then be useless (just means they've breached twice rather than once). Furthermore, a bank is subject to an implied duty of confidentiality with regard to a customer’s affairs (see [[Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England [1924] 1 KB 461]]). Bank will refer to its own knowledge and monitoring.

### Change of Business

It will therefore usually be an event of default if the borrower makes any **material change to its business**, ceases to carry on any material part of its business, or disposes of a material part of its business.

### Change of Control

Change of control usually triggers **mandatory prepayments**, rather than an event of default.

### Insolvency

- The insolvency of a borrower will, without question, be an **event of default**.
- Any **negotiation** of this clause will simply relate to the **timing** of default.
- The bank will want **time to take action** (e.g., enforce security) at the first sign of a problem.
- Some clauses may make reference to the **two insolvency tests** in s 123 of the IA 1986.
	- Section 123(1) deems a company unable to pay its debts if it has not paid a debt **three weeks** after service of a **statutory demand** or court order (if the debt is over £750).
	- Section 123(2) deems a company unable to pay its debts if the value of its **assets is less than its liabilities**.
		- [[BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd v Eurosail-UK-2007-3BL Plc & Others [2011] EWCA Civ 227]]: s 123(2) ‘applies to a company whose assets and liabilities (including contingent and future liabilities) are such that it had reached a point of no return’.
- Usually also triggers relating to **insolvency proceedings**.
	- Typically, this will include any corporate action, legal proceedings or other procedure or step.
	- e.g., moratorium, appointment of liquidator, enforcement of any security over the borrower's assets.
- Borrower will want the event of default to trigger as late as possible, e.g., by negotiating a remedy period, a carve out for disputed debts, or a default limited to actual appointment of administrator/ receiver or similar.

### Proceedings

- Event of default if the borrower becomes involved in any **material litigation, arbitration or similar** proceedings.
- Borrower will try to negotiate a *de minimus* limit or proceedings which will/ might have a material adverse effect on the borrower's ability to perform obligations.

### Unlawful Performance

- Event of default if it becomes **unlawful** for a borrower to continue to perform its obligations under a facility agreement.
- Event of default if the borrower should lose **any consents/ authorisations** necessary to perform obligations under the loan.
- Borrower will want **materiality** and may ask for **mandatory pre-payment** for materiality.

### General Default

- Event of default if the borrower fails to comply with “other obligations”.
- Invariably drafted with a relatively long ‘**cure period**’ of perhaps 30 days.
- **Sweep up provision** for any minor defaults.

### Qualified Accounts

- Event of default which is triggered if the **borrower’s accounts are qualified** by the auditors.
- Common in leveraged transactions.
- Borrower will want to limit any default to a qualification which has a **material adverse effect** on its ability to perform its obligations under the loan facility.

### Repudiation

**Actual or attempted repudiation** by the borrower is an event of default. Rarely negotiated.

### Material Adverse Change

- Colloquially, “MAC”.
- Acts as a **sweep up provision** allowing the bank to call a default if there is a material adverse change in the borrower's position or circumstances which might prevent it from complying with any provisions in the facility agreement.
- Many borrowers will try to exclude this provision, and it is always heavily negotiated.
- Strong clause: Any event or circumstance occurs which the **Majority Lenders** believe might have a **material adverse effect** on the ability of the Borrower to perform or comply with its obligations under this Agreement.
- Borrower may negotiate:
	- Threshold for Majority Lenders (commonly $\frac{2}{3}$)
	- Insertion of "reasonably".
	- Definition of material adverse effect.
- Most common use for the MAC is to threaten default and persuade a borrower to start a dialogue with the bank.
- In [[BNP Paribas v Yukos Oil Company [2005] EWHC 1321 (Ch)]], the **court upheld the validity** of accelerating a loan based on a MAC event of default.

## Interaction with Other Clauses

Events of default should not overlap with any representations or undertakings. If there are overlaps, check they do not contradict.

## Action on Default

A bank may:

1. **Cancel** any undrawn commitments
2. Put all or part of the **facility on demand**, and take over the selection of interest periods.
3. **Demand immediate repayment** of part or all outstanding capital and interest, as well as any cash collateral.
4. Enforce any **security**.
5. Do **nothing**.

A bank will want these remedies available ‘on or at any time after an Event of Default has occurred and until it is waived …’; a borrower will want to add ‘… **or remedied**’. Banks commonly allow this. Implications:

1. If the borrower can **unilaterally remedy** an event of default, it will have **little incentive to disclose** when it occurs.
2. What constitutes a **remedy** of certain types of default is **not always clear**. Might say “remedied to the satisfaction of the bank”.

In a syndicated loan, the **agent** will often be given **discretion** as to what action to take on an event of default, with an overriding obligation to act in accordance with the instructions of the majority banks.

- Enables a **fast** decision.
- But agent takes potential **liability** for wrong decisions.

If the loan is terminated and outstanding amounts are immediately repayable, default interest applies until the amounts are settled in full.

## Grace Periods, Defaults and Potential Defaults

Some events of default include a **specified period** during which the borrower is permitted to **remedy** the event or apply for a **waiver**. During the grace period, the borrower is prevented from borrowing new money (“draw stop”).

> [!defn]
> An event of default with an in-built grace period is sometimes referred to as a ‘potential event of default’.

> [!note] Variation
> LMA facilities define “default” to mean
> 
> > an Event of Default or any event or circumstance specified in Clause [ ] (Events of Default) which would (with the expiry of a grace period, the giving of notice, the making of any determination under the Finance Documents or any combination of any of the foregoing) be an Event of Default.
> 
> The equivalent of a ‘potential event of default’ is then described as ‘a Default other than an Event of Default’.

Borrowers must undertake to tell the banks as soon as they are aware of a ‘potential event of default’, but

- Borrowers under a revolving credit facility (RCF) will argue that the draw stop within a grace period should not prevent them rolling over a maturing RCF loan.
- Borrowers should not agree to give a repeating representation that there are no ‘potential events of default’ (or equivalent).

## Bank's Perspective

**Demanding early repayment** will be considered a last resort, but a useful **negotiating tool**. The bank may demand increased fees/ margin, tighter financial covenants or other terms.

A bank will not accept arguments that the borrower should not be defaulted on the basis of events beyond its control. The rationale is **risk management**, not fairness.

## Borrower's Perspective

Borrower must be very cautious when agreeing to the events of default. In reality, though, a bank is unlikely to withdraw a loan without considerable provocation.

# Boiler Plate and Mechanics Clauses

## Repayment, Prepayment and Cancellation

### Repayment Clause

Arguably the most important provision in the agreement. Form of repayment depends on type of facility. Overdraft usually on demand and does not require a repayment date.

### Prepayment

Most loans will allow a borrower to repay capital early. Without a contractual provision, borrower probably has no right to prepay a loan. Prepaying will save interest payments. Borrowers may refinance existing loans partway through their term.

#### Broken Funding

If B repays, the bank may be left to service an interbank loan without an equivalent interest stream from the borrower. Or bank may incur breakage fees for terminating the interbank loan early. So usually there is a "break costs" clause. Paying break costs could be avoided if B prepays at the end of an interest period.

### Prepayment Fee

Banks will ask for a prepayment fee (“prepayment premium”) to cover administration costs of early repayment. Loans for leveraged acquisitions may feature call protection: an extra amount payable by the borrower if it prepays within e.g., 12 months of utilisation. Unlikely to be drafted into agreements for senior facilities.

### Order of Application

Amortised loans: banks resist treating a partial pre-payment as an early settlement of the next repayment due. The bank wants a borrower to demonstrate the financial control necessary to maintain a steady repayment regime. May insist that any prepayment is treated as satisfying the final repayment first, and then in inverse order (reduces life of loan) / spread over the scheduled amounts rateably (reduces exposure but maintains relationship).

### Preference

If borrower becomes insolvent $\leq 6$ months of prepayment (or 2 years for connected party), risk of liquidator/ administrator applying to set aside the prepayment as a preference under s 239 IA 1986. Typically, a remote risk.

### Mandatory Prepayment

For an investment grade facility, there are 2 circumstances in which a borrower will be required to make a mandatory prepayment:

1. If it becomes unlawful for a bank to lend to the borrower (e.g., sanctions).
2. If there is a change in control of the borrower. Control is typically defined as the ability to remove half or more of the directors, the ability to dictate how the company is run, the holding of a majority of the shares in the borrower, or the ability to cast more than half the shareholder votes.

Leveraged facility usually includes additional mandatory prepayment events:

1. If the borrower disposes of certain fundamental assets other than in the ordinary course of business (and assuming the proceeds are not required to purchase a replacement asset);
2. If the borrower receives insurance monies for an asset it is not replacing;
3. If the borrower generates more cash than it is deemed to require to run its business (this is known as an ‘excess cash sweep’);
4. If the facility is required to fund an acquisition and the purchase price is subsequently adjusted downwards due to a revaluation event; and
5. If the borrower subsequently raises funds through an issue of shares or debt securities.

Repayment is usually allocated pro rata across banks.

### Cancellation

If a loan provides a commitment period over which the borrower is allowed to utilise the facility, the bank most likely charge a commitment fee for making the facility available. Many loans allow the borrower to cancel during the commitment period and save on commitment fees. May be mandatorily cancelled in the event of default.

## Margin Protection

The interest rate charged by a bank on a syndicated loan is typically calculated by adding the margin to the estimated cost of lending. If the cost of lending rises, the bank will want to have mechanisms to pass this onto the lender.

### Regulatory Capital

If a bank cannot recover money it has lent, there is a danger it may be unable to repay depositors and other lenders. To reduce this risk, banks required to maintain regulatory capital. This is a minimum level of assets which must be maintained as a “buffer”.

#### Origins

- The Basel Committee (1980s) came up with Basel Capital Accord, adopted by all major banking jurisdictions.
- A more sophisticated version, Basel II (2008) was adopted by most countries (except US).
- Basel III implemented 2013-23.

#### Rationale

> [!important]
> The key proposition of Basel regime is that a bank needs to recover its assets (primarily loans) to repay its depositors: if there is a risk that an asset cannot be recovered in full, it must be backed by ‘capital’ to create a ‘buffer’. Capital buffer known as "regulatory capital".

Starting point: regulatory capital is 8% of the value of each asset (but this is a minimum). Assets must be risk weighted.

#### Risk Weightings

- Basel I approach: calculation of counterparty credit risk was relatively crude, grouping diverse borrower types into single risk categories.
- Basel II better: banks used a "standardised approach" or "internal ratings based" approach.

| Approach              | Details                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standardised approach | Banks apply counterparty risk weightings as pre-determined in the regulations. |
| IRB approach          | Allows a bank to use its own internal model to calculate the risk of recovery from different counterparties.                                                                                |

#### Types of Capital

What is capital? Not just cash in an account. Basel II splits into 3 types. At least half a bank’s regulatory capital had to be core Tier 1 capital, and Tier 3 capital could only be used to cover limited regulatory capital requirements.

| Tier of capital | Details                                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1          | Includes ordinary share capital, verified net profits and certain reserves. |
| Tier 2          | Less permanence than Tier 1 and might incur fixed costs.                    |
| Tier 3          | Least stable, e.g., short-term subordinated loans, non-verified profits.                                                                             |

#### Basel III & IV

Even more stringent requirements, including new buffers, increase in capital requirement for systemically important banks, liquidity requirements.

#### Increased Costs Clause

Cost of maintaining regulatory capital passed to the borrower as part of the margin on a loan. If the cost of capital increases, this eats into the margin and reduces profit. Such a provision can be resented by the borrower.

### Mandatory Cost

PRA funds itself by leveraging fees against regulated fees. Facility agreements give banks the opportunity to recover these costs from the borrower. But LMA withdrew the schedule from market documentation in 2013, and now not used much.

## Costs and Expenses

Bank will require a borrower to indemnify it against the incidental costs it incurs setting up and running the loan. Includes:

- Costs of negotiation, preparation and execution
- Registration of loan and ancillary documents
- Preservation and enforcement of the bank's rights under the loan.

Usually covered by an indemnity from the borrower in the mandate letter.

## Fees

Types include

- Front end fees
	- For initial work done to put the loan together.
	- For a syndicated loan, known as the “arrangement fee”.
	- Arranger may have used participation fee to attract other banks to the syndicate.
	- Amount of fees remaining once the arranger has paid any participation fees is called "praecipium".
- Underwriting fee
	- Initial banks underwrite syndication.
- Commitment fee
	- Charged on committed but undrawn money.
	- Usually 25-50% of the margin.
- Agent's fee
	- Bank which takes on agency role (administrative or security agent)
- Cancellation fee
- Utilisation fee
	- For facilities intended to be used only rarely, e.g., standby or swing-line facilities.

### Fee Letter

Fees usually put in a separate fee letter. Provides confidentiality from syndicate members, other borrowers and the market. The facility agreement will specifically refer to the agent's fees - but not the amount – to avoid argument that the arrangement is a secret profit in breach of fiduciary duties.

## Remedies

### Remedies and Waivers

Most facilities contain the following boilerplate:

> The rights and remedies of the Bank under this agreement:
> 1. shall not be waived by any failure, or delay, in their exercise;
> 2. are cumulative, and shall not exclude or restrict its rights and remedies under any other agreement or the general law; and
> 3. may be exercised in whole, in part, and as often as necessary.

(1) tries to avoid the borrower using the equitable doctrine of “laches” (form of estoppel) to preclude the bank exercising a right/ remedy after unreasonable delay. But by case law, continued performance of a contract inconsistent with termination and will result in a loss of the right to terminate ([[Tele2 International Card Company SA v Post Office Limited [2009] EWCA Civ 9]]).

(2) says the bank can use more than remedy at once. Tries to avoid any merger of rights between facility agreement and security document (about not losing an inferior security, which may happen under case law if you also have a superior security).

### Partial Invalidity

Include:

> If any provision of this agreement is prohibited, unenforceable, void or invalid, that shall not invalidate, or otherwise affect the enforceability of, the remaining provisions hereof.

Two underlying principles in relation to severance:

1. a court will not construct a new contract: any severance must leave the original contract standing and not alter its basic scope or intention; and
2. a court will not sever if to do so is against public policy.

[[Goldsoll v Goldman [1915] 1 Ch 292]] blue pencil test (can you just cross out the severed provisions in blue pen).

### Amendments and Waivers

No alterations to the provisions of an executed document will be effective without the agreement of all parties. Most syndicated facilities allow amendments and waivers to most of their clauses to be agreed by a majority of the syndicate (defined in the agreement as either $\frac{2}{3}$ or "simple majority" - $\frac{1}{2}$).

Common provisions:

| Provision     | Details                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yank the bank | Clause allowing the borrower to take a bank out of the syndicate if the bank votes against an amendment/ waiver which the majority of banks voted to allow. |
| Use or lose   | If the bank does not vote on an amendment/ waiver within a time period, the bank's commitment is disregarded in calculating whether the borrower gets the required majority.                                                                                                                                                             |

## Force Majeure

Suppose there are circumstances in which the contracting parties consider performance of their obligations is, through no fault of their own, no longer possible. The clause may provide that obligations under the contract are suspended until circumstances have passed or that the contract is immediately terminated. Usually no sanctions attached.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

### Common Law

Under common law, parties are free to choose governing law provided that their choice is bona fide and legal ([[Vita Food Products Inc v Unus Shipping Co Ltd (in Liquidation [1939] AC 277]]). This determines issues including the validity of the document and any amendments, interpretation of clauses and remoteness of damages.

### Rome I

Allows complete freedom to choose the governing law of a **contract** (expressly or impliedly), although public policy and some mandatory rules may supersede the governing law if necessary. The Regulation is retained EU law.

### Rome II

Allows parties to choose the governing law of **non-contractual** obligations. The choice will be upheld if:

1. The claim falls within Rome II
2. The context is a commercial activity
3. The choice of law was freely negotiated.

### Choosing

May be bank's country, borrower's country, or English law (for stability and for being creditor friendly). If parties do not choose, courts check for an implied choice (e.g., choice of jurisdiction).

### Jurisdiction

Specifies the jurisdiction of enforcement.

The three regimes that have usually applied to a contract giving jurisdiction to English courts are:

1. the Recast Brussels Regulation which applies to proceedings commenced on or after 10 January 2015 binding all EU members.
2. the 2007 Lugano Convention, which binds EU members, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland; and
3. English domestic law.

Complicated by Brexit.

Some facility agreements contain one-sided jurisdiction clauses, allowing the bank to sue in the named jurisdiction or any other competent jurisdiction, but only allowing the borrower to sue in the named jurisdiction. Though these have been challenged in court, still included in most facility agreements.

### Agent for Service of Process

If any of the obligors in the facility is not an English registered company and does not have a branch or other place of business in Great Britain, the service of any English court documents on that obligor would require service ‘out of jurisdiction’.

> [!statute] CPR 6.11(1) - Service of the claim form by contractually agreed method
> Where –
> - (a) a contract contains a term providing that, in the event of a claim being started in relation to the contract, the claim form may be served by a method or at a place specified in the contract; and
> - (b) a claim solely in respect of that contract is started,
> 
> the claim form may, subject to paragraph (2), be served on the defendant by the method or at the place specified in the contract.

The usual contractually agreed method is to appoint a 3rd party to receive documents on the obligors' behalf. This avoids a bank having to apply to court for leave to serve a foreign corporation. Several companies offer services for a fee.

## Miscellaneous

Other provisions include:

- Inter-bank provisions
	- Monitoring of defaults
	- Liability for actions and information
	- Resignation of agent banks
	- Indemnities
	- Sharing of money if some banks receive money or recover money and others do not
- Set-off
	- Authority from borrower giving the bank a right (but not an obligation) to set off credit balances in favour of the borrower against any amounts due but unpaid.
	- Set-off is the cancellation of mutual obligations outside of a court proceeding. It allows a debtor to reduce the amount it owes to a creditor by the amount the creditor owes to the debtor. Set-off is a self-help remedy that is governed by state statutory and common law.
- Notices
	- Communications must be written and may be sent by post or by fax. By email if agreed by both parties.
	- Banks might want deemed service provisions for borrower, but will never accept a reciprocal arrangement.
- Defaulting lender provisions –
	- If a lender becomes insolvent, B may be able to
		- Cancel any undrawn commitment of a defaulting lender.
		- No commitment fee payable on any retained commitment
		- If defaulting lender retains a commitment, it will not be allowed to vote on any decisions under the facility (it is disenfranchised).
		- Defaulting lender may be forced to transfer participation in the facility to another lender at par.
		- Any amount lent under revolving credit facility automatically turned into a term loan.
		- Identity of a defaulting lender disclosed by the agent to the borrower.
		- If facility agent defaults, agent may be bypassed and can be removed by a majority vote of the remaining banks.

## Execution

Where a syndicated loan requires a party to perform several defined roles, conventional for a bank to execute separately for each of the roles. s 44(6) CA 2006 requires that if a director is signing a document as director for more than one company (quite common for large groups), they must sign separately for each company.

> [!question]
> Whhat if the loan involves a large syndicate and it is not possible to find a signing date which works for everyone?

1. Documents can be sent to each signatory in turn (cumbersome)
2. Absent party may appoint someone to sign on their behalf under a power of attorney, created through a deed. The attorney can sign in their own name or that of the principal (s 7(1) Powers of Attorney Act 1971).
3. Document may be executed in counterparts – identical copies simultaneously signed. Methods:
	1. Printed documents sent to each party by post/ courier. After signing, parties return their documents to the solicitor. The original agreement is a composite of the counterparts.
	2. Documents circulated by email/ made accessible via an online platform. Signed document signed as PDF and returned.
	3. Documents circulated by email, instructions to print and sign signature pages, and then scan into PDF and return with the electronic copy of the unsigned original. The true original document is the electronic version.
	4. Signature pages printed, signed and returned. This means there is no “original document”. Cannot be used for executing deeds or agreements with land clauses.
	5. Just signature pages circulated. Solicitor authorised to affix signature pages and document treated as executed. Cannot be used for deeds/ land agreements.

## US Vs English Loan Facilities

Factors:

1. Similar insolvency regimes.
2. Generally easier to take security over all the borrower's assets under US law and registration/ enforcement regimes are more standardised.
3. US more litigious: unconnected 3rd parties can purchase and pursue legal claims
4. US has more liquidity – convergence between loan and bond market terms.

Differences:

- Call protection
	- US phrase for early prepayment fee.
- Limited amortisation
	- Annual amortisation ~1% on the term loan
- Covenant lite
	- English leveraged loan facilities oblige the borrower to show regularly (e.g., 3 months) that it is maintaining financial performance predicted in business plan.
	- US facilities just have a single financial covenant, tested if the borrower wants to take specified actions. Cash flow covenants rare. Much less onerous.
- MAC event of default.
	- Not included in US law facilities.
- Majority lender votes
	- US typically requires 1/2, English usually requires 2/3.
- Loan transfer
	- US facilities will allow the term loan to be freely transferred without borrower consent.
	- English more restrictive; may be a white list of acceptable transferees/ borrower consent required.

# Novation, Assignment, Sub-participation

A bank may use loans like fixed assets: purchasing them, keeping them for a while to earn income, and then disposing of them.

## Why Sell a Loan

1. Realising capital
	1. Improve liquidity to take advantage of new/ better lending opportunities.
	2. Focus on a particular market.
2. Risk management
	1. Sell loans to diversify away from one type of loan/ borrower.
3. Balance sheet
	1. Bank must maintain a % of its capital as cover for loans (regulatory capital).
	2. Sell loans to raise capital for others
4. Profit
	1. Short-term profit by selling a loan (e.g., if interest rates fall)
	2. If a borrower has defaulted/ is performing badly, a lender may choose to sell participation at a discount to crystallise loss
5. Prestige
	1. Bank may want initial involvement in a facility which is high-profile/ important, but may sell this after.
6. Syndication
	1. Some loans provide for syndication post-closing.

## Moving Rights and Obligations

- Most contracts operate by giving rights and obligations (liabilities) to each party.
- Under most facility agreements, a bank’s fundamental obligation is to lend money (the borrower has a right to borrow), whilst its fundamental rights are usually to receive interest and eventual return of capital (the borrower is obliged to service and repay the loan).
- In order to fully dispose of a loan, a bank must dispose of both its rights and its obligations.
- Under English law, contractual obligations can be moved only with the consent of the party to whom the obligation is owed (i.e., borrower's consent is required).

## Selling Assets

Methods of disposing of an asset:

1. Novation
2. Legal (“statutory”/ “disclosed”) assignment
3. Equitable (“undisclosed”) assignment
4. Sub-participation
5. Risk participation.

Main aim of the bank: to remove the risk associated with the asset.

### Novation

The only way in which a party can effectively ‘transfer’ all its rights and obligations under a contract is with the consent of all the parties involved.

> [!important]
> Novation involves one party’s rights and obligations under a contract being cancelled and discharged, whilst a third party assumes identical new rights and obligations in their place.

The new bank assumes identical rights and obligations with respect to the borrower as applied to the existing bank.

> [!warning]
> Strictly, a novation does not transfer rights and liabilities: it cancels an existing contract and replaces it with another. The borrower’s promise to perform its obligations in favour of a new bank is consideration for the existing bank releasing the old debt.

#### Advantages

- Moving obligations
	- Only proven method of moving contractual obligations as well as rights.
	- Allows the existing bank to dispose of a loan which has an unutilised commitment (e.g., under an RCF).
	- The new bank achieves a relationship with the borrower as if it were a party to the facility agreement.
- Risk transfer
	- Can fully remove a loan (including undrawn commitments) from the existing bank's balance sheet and exclude it from regulatory capital requirements.
- Easy syndication
	- If the original facility agreement included transfer certificates, the existing bank can take a large commitment without the delay of putting together an underwriting syndicate.

#### Disadvantages

- Consent
	- Consent of all parties involved in the original loan document is required, including any parties which guaranteed the borrower's performance.
	- Puts lots of power in the borrower's hands.
	- Solution: use of transfer certificates
		- Facility agreement will contain a clause under which the parties agree that a bank may dispose by novation any or all of its commitment – open offer to take a loan (though borrower's consent may be required in certain circumstances).
		- Pro-forma certificate usually included as a schedule.
	- Controversy
		- Australian case [[Goodridge v Macquarie Bank Limited [2010] FCA 67]] held that a prior agreement to novation in a loan agreement was invalid and simply an ‘agreement to agree’.
		- [[Habibsons Bank Ltd v Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited [2010] EWCA Civ 1335]]: CoA obiter criticised the decision.
	- A system similar to the transfer certificate is the transferable loan certificate (TLC). The only significant difference is that the TLC operates through the agent bank issuing certificates and keeping a register of transfers.
- Secured loans
	- Novation (probably) restarts hardening periods during which security may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue/ preferred transaction/ avoidance of floating charges.
	- Security being re-dated may lose priority over other security.
		- Solution: appoint a security trustee to hold any security granted under the loan on trust for the banks.
		- Banks participating in the facility from time to time are beneficiaries.
- Disclosure
	- Difficult to hide the identity of a transferee bank.

### Legal Assignment

Assignment is the transfer of **rights**. **s 136 LPA 1925** provides that an assignment of debts and other choses in action will only be recognised at common law if it is:

1. In writing and signed by the assignor;
2. Absolute (i.e., unconditional); and
	- To be ‘absolute’ in the context of loan transfers, an assignment must transfer the whole of the debt owed to the existing bank ([[Walter and Sullivan Ltd v Murphy (J) and Sons Ltd [1955] 2 QB 584]]) (and cannot be ‘by way of charge’)
3. Notified in writing to any person(s) against whom the assignor could enforce the assigned rights.

> [!tip]
> - If any one of the conditions for legal (or "statutory") assignment is not fulfilled, the assignment will be an equitable one.
> - An assignment can transfer only rights, not obligations

#### Advantages

- Rights transferred
	- Rights under a facility agreement transferred without requiring the borrower's consent.
- Borrower's payments
	- On receiving notice of an assignment, the borrower is obliged to pay any monies due under the assigned loan to the new bank.
- Secured loan
	- Any security, or a bank’s rights as beneficiary of any security sharing agreement, may be assigned along with the debt, but is usually held by a Security Trustee or under a parallel debt structure.

#### Disadvantages

- Obligations not transferred
	- Existing bank cannot assign any undrawn commitments (makes assigning a revolving credit facility problematic)
	- Obligations to other syndicate banks not transferred.
	- Some facility documents therefore include assignment mechanics which purport to assign the existing bank’s rights, release the existing bank from any obligations relating to that part of its commitment, and require the new bank to assume equivalent obligations.
- Rights not transferred
	- The rights under a contract can be assigned without consent only in ‘cases where it can make no difference to the person on whom the obligation lies to which of two persons he is to discharge it’ ([[Tolhurst v Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900) Ltd [1902] 2 KB 660]]).
	- Objective test – character of the assignee will b ignored.
	- Danger that any indemnity provisions for increased costs may be unassignable without consent because they are personal.

### Equitable Assignment

An assignment which does not meet any of the provisions required for legal assignment under the LPA 1925, s 136 will be an equitable assignment.

Procedurally, an equitable assignee must join the assignor (the existing bank) in any action on the debt ([[Three Rivers DC v Bank of England [1995] 4 All ER 312]]).

#### Advantages

- Partial assignment
	- If a bank wants to assign part of an outstanding loan, it must use an equitable assignment.
- Non-disclosure
	- If a bank wants to assign an outstanding loan without disclosing the identity of the new bank to the borrower, it must use an equitable assignment.

#### Disadvantages

- Payments
	- If the equitable assignment is not notified to the borrower, the borrower is entitled to continue making payments through the existing bank.
		- Old bank might be happy to skim interest
		- New bank taking a double credit risk.
- Subject to equities
	- If the equitable assignment is unnotified, a new bank will be subject to all ‘equities’ (e.g., mutual rights of set-off) which arise between the existing bank and the borrower, until notification of assignment.

#### Form of Notice

A notice of assignment (legal or equitable) should require a borrower to confirm:

1. the amount of the existing bank’s debt;
2. that it has no rights of set-off or counter-claim against the existing bank;
3. that it has no notice of other assignments of the same debt;
4. the facility agreement has not been varied; and
5. that it will pay amounts due and payable under the underlying contract to the new bank’s order.

### Sub-participation

Novation and assignment are attractive to banks because they enable it to remove loans from its balance sheet. Possible to achieve the same effect while leaving the original loan in place: sub-participation (“funded participation”).

> [!defn] Sub-participation
> An arrangement under which an existing bank matches part or all of its loan to a borrower with a deposit it takes from a new bank (the ‘sub-participant’). The new bank agrees that its deposit will be serviced and repaid only when the borrower services and repays the loan from the existing bank. The sub-participant has effectively taken on the risk of the first loan.

- The transaction does not involve any transfer of rights or obligations: the existing bank's contractual relationship with the borrower is unaffected.
- Since sub-participation is an entirely separate agreement, the sub-participant bank has no-recourse against the borrower (“non-recourse transaction”).
- Security provided remains with the existing bank.

#### Advantages

- Risk transfer
	- Sub-participation removes a loan from inclusion in the existing bank's regulatory capital requirements, other than in respect of undrawn commitments.
- Consent
	- Unless there is a prohibition in the original facility agreement, existing bank can sub-participate without the consent of the borrower.
	- All banks owe a duty of confidentiality to clients ([[Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England [1924] 1 KB 461]]).
		- Existing bank intending to sub-participate will want to include a clause in the original facility agreement will want a clause allowing it to release information about the borrower and the loan.
- Non-disclosure
	- Existing bank does not have to disclose sub-participation to the borrower, and most sub-participations will be silent.

#### Disadvantages

- Sub-participant's credit risk
	- Double credit risk for the sub-participation.
- Risk transfer
	- May not off-load the entire risk of undrawn commitments if it just results in the existing bank taking a risk on the new bank instead of the borrower.
	- The sub-participation agreement must ensure that the existing bank is put in funds in time to meet the borrower’s demands for utilisation.

### Risk Participation

- Form of participation which acts like a guarantee.
- Risk participant agrees for a fee to put the existing bank in funds in certain circumstances (e.g., payment default by borrower).
- Common use: to cover "unfunded" assets (guarantees, letters of credit, swaps).
	- If existing bank's customer fails to meet reimbursement obligations, the new bank will put the existing bank in funds.

## Global Transfer Agreement

> [!defn]
> A new contract which amends (and restates) the facility agreement to add a new schedule of commitments.

- A deal may require a large amount of simultaneous transfers.
- To avoid preparing a large number of transfer certificates, a Global Transfer Agreement may be used.
- But transparency may not suit all deals.

## Loan Market Association

- Founded 1996.
- Key objective is ‘improving liquidity, efficiency and transparency in the primary and secondary syndicated loan markets in EMEA’.
- Creates widely used loan documentation.

## Tax Implications

2 main types of tax which might affect asset sales: stamp duty (or sometimes, stamp duty reserve tax) and withholding tax.

- Sub-participation does not involve any transfer of rights, and so will not attract stamp duty.
- Novation will not usually involve a transfer of property for stamp duty purposes and so will not normally attract the tax (unless the asset includes, e.g., rights to acquire property).
- Assignment may attract stamp duty or SDRT, but exemptions can often by used.

> [!defn]
> Income tax in respect of recurring payments at source is sometimes collected by requiring the payer to make a deduction on account of income tax before making the payment. This deduction is generally known as withholding tax. It frequently applies to dividends (although not those paid by UK companies), interest and royalties.

In all asset sales between banks, and involving a UK resident/domiciled borrower, the relevance of withholding tax on interest payments will depend largely on whether the exemption under s 879 of the ITA 2007 applies.

The s 879 exemption will apply to loans which have been assigned as long as the advance was initially made by a ‘bank’ and the assignee is beneficially entitled to the interest and within the charge to UK corporation tax at the time interest is paid. If a loan is novated, this probably creates a new advance and so must be made to a ‘bank’ to ensure s 879 still applies.

> [!statute] s 879 ITA 2007 - interest paid on advances from banks
> (1) The duty to deduct a sum representing income tax under section 874 does not apply to a payment of interest on an advance from a bank if, at the time when the payment is made, the person beneficially entitled to the interest is within the charge to corporation tax as respects the interest [F1or is a bank that would be within the charge to corporation tax as respects the interest apart from section 18A of CTA 2009].
> 
> (2) Section 991 (meaning of “bank”) applies for the purposes of this section.

Summary – withholding tax not payable if:

- The bank is a UK corporation taxpayer
- The bank is international, but there is a double-tax treaty between the bank's country and the UK

## FSMA Implications

> [!statute] s 19 FSMA 2000
> No person may carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom or purport to do so unless he is an authorised person or an exempt person.

When selling participations, the bank should ensure that it is authorised to do so under the Act.

## Securitisation

Securitisation involves the owner of a pool of assets (the ‘originator’) transferring them to a specially formed company (a ‘special purpose vehicle’ or ‘SPV’). The SPV funds its purchase of the assets by issuing debt securities (it is therefore known as the ‘issuer’). Coupon and redemption of the debt securities are met with, and secured over, the asset pool.

## Bank's Perspective

- Most banks will require the flexibility to sell a loan if they decide it is necessary or desirable, but will accept some restrictions.
- A bank’s solicitor should ensure the facility transfer language allows transfer not just to other banks but also to trusts, funds, or other entities engaged in buying loans.

## Borrower's Perspective

However, a borrower’s relationship with its lenders will be crucial if it requires waivers to actual or potential defaults, if it wants to make changes to the loan documents going forward, or needs tolerance in interpreting provisions.

Most facilities allow transfer subject to the borrower's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Commonly negotiated conditions:

- Borrower consent deemed given if not given within a certain timeframe
- Transfers to borrower's competitors prohibited
- Transfers to certain fund types prohibited (those more activist ones)
- List of named institutions to which banks can transfer without consent pre-agreed.
- Freedom to transfer upon the borrower's event of default?

> [!question] Can a borrower buy back portions of their own loan debt?
> - This is a very cheap way to repay a debt. 
> - May be issues with prepayment restrictions, pro-rata sharing between lenders, restrictions on cash usage, and issues with novation. 
> - Even if buy-back is allowed, the buying entity is usually required to allow all the syndicate banks a chance to sell.

# Drafting Tips

## Creating Document

- Written facility agreement primarily used to benefit the bank.
- Drafting the document traditionally remains in the control of the bank's solicitor.
- LMA precedents for investment grade and leveraged deals widely used as a starting point. Can eliminate some basic negotiation.

## Aims

- Certainty
	- Document must reflect what has been agreed.
	- Can help avoid litigation.
- Ambiguity
	- Often desired by a party, e.g., “reasonableness”.
	- Uncertainty usually resolved in favour of the borrower.
- Workable document
	- Document must be reasonably user-friendly.
	- Use headings and contents table.
	- Drafting must work in practice, e.g., references to business days.

> [!warning]
> If using precedents, ensure conformity of terminology and check if any standard clauses have been removed/ amended. 

## Techniques

### Clause Construction

Coode's principle of clause construction:

1. Refer to any exceptions first: e.g. ‘Subject to …’.
2. Next, set out the circumstances or conditions upon which the legal right or obligation depends, using the present tense: e.g. ‘If X does […] and Y does […]’.
3. Next, set out the right or obligation using the active and avoiding the passive: e.g. ‘X must do 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5’.
4. Finally, put the provision into paragraphs and give it a heading.

### Qualifying an Obligation

Many obligations will be drafted as absolute. A borrower may be able to agree a qualifier being added to an obligation. The usual qualifiers are ‘reasonable’, ‘all reasonable’ or ‘best’ endeavours.

| Term                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reasonable endeavours     | Requires a party to adopt and pursue one reasonable course of action to achieve the result, bearing in mind its own commercial interests and the likelihood of success.                                                                                             |
| All reasonable endeavours | Requires a party to explore all avenues reasonably open to it, and explore them to the extent reasonable. |
| Best endeavours           | Most onerous, requires a party to take steps which a prudent, determined and reasonable obligee, acting in its own interests and desiring to achieve that result, would take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It is worth noting that ‘all reasonable’ and ‘best’ endeavours are very similar, and some judges have held there is no practical difference ([[Rhodia International Holdings v Huntsman International LLC [2007] All ER (D) 264]], [[Jet2.com Ltd v Blackpool Airport Ltd [2011] EWHC 1529 (Comm)]]). The onus is on the obligor to show it has met the required level of ‘endeavour’.

Parameters can be specified, but then this leads to yet more negotiation (so usual not to bother).

### Materiality

The borrower may argue that a term constrains it too tightly given commercial realities. So “material” may be drafted in. This holds some risk for a bank; a bank will be wary of calling a default only later to be proven to have acted negligently.

Options:

- Quantify “material”
	- Complicated/ impossible
- Entitle the bank to decide what is material
	- Often by a majority of syndicated banks.

### Would or Might

Some clauses (e.g., certain events of default) will be drafted so that they are triggered by events which ‘might’ have particular consequences (e.g., litigation which might affect B's ability to perform obligations). Borrower may try to argue that “will” or “would” should be used instead.

The parties will usually agree to some form of compromise, such as ‘is reasonably likely to …’, or ‘will in the bank’s opinion’.

### De Minimis

*De minimis non curat lex* is the general legal principle that some breaches of duty or mistakes are too trivial to attract a legal remedy.

The level at which a de minimis is set is crucial; it must allow the borrower sufficient ‘leeway’ to run its day-to-day business, whilst not being so high as to prevent the provision which it modifies from operating effectively. Some de minimis provisions will set an aggregate outstanding maximum to avoid lots of minor breaches being permissible, which together could signal a serious issue.

### Reasonableness

Powerful tool for the borrower to reduce the severity of a provision. Difficult for the bank to objectively decide what is reasonable.

## Key Words

### Subsidiaries

"Subsidiary" will usually be defined in the facility agreement as referring to one of the two definitions in CA 2006:

#### S 1159 (as Supplemented by Sch 6)

For a company to be its subsidiary, the ‘parent’ company must:

 1. hold a majority of the voting rights which can be exercised at a general meeting of the ‘subsidiary’; or
 2. be a member of the ‘subsidiary’ and have the right to appoint or remove its directors who together control more than half the voting rights at board meetings; or
 3. be a member of the ‘subsidiary’ and control, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders, a majority of the voting rights which can be exercised at a general meeting of the ‘subsidiary’; or
 4. be a holding company of another subsidiary which is itself the holding company of the ‘subsidiary’.  
 In determining the voting rights, etc, of the ‘holding company’, the voting rights of its subsidiaries and certain nominees and trustees are taken into account.

#### S 1162 and Sch 7

Definition of subsidiaries in relation to financial statements. The important difference from s 1159 is the concept of ‘subsidiary undertaking’, whereby the ability to exercise a ‘dominant influence’ over a company (or partnership, or other unincorporated association) makes it a ‘subsidiary undertaking’ for accounting purposes. This might include joint-venture arrangements which a company would not usually consider to be a subsidiary.

A bank will favour the wider s 1162 definition. The borrower will ask that provisions only apply to its material subsidiaries (those worth over a certain amount). The bank will want “material subsidiaries from time to time” to catch any that grow.

In [[Enviroco Ltd v Farstad Supply A/S [2009] EWCA Civ 1399]], the Court of Appeal decided that a company ceased to be a subsidiary of its holding company when the subsidiary’s shares were secured to a bank by way of legal mortgage.

### Notwithstanding

Means “in spite of”. Antonym: “subject to”.

### Definitions

- “Means” gives a precise definition.
- “Includes” makes the definition broader and less certain.

### S 61 LPA 1925

Section 61 of the LPA 1925 applies, amongst other things, to all deeds and contracts made after 1925 and, unless the context otherwise requires, will deem:

1. ‘month’ to mean a calendar month;
2. ‘person’ to include a corporation;
3. the singular to include the plural (and vice versa);
4. the masculine to include the feminine (and vice versa).

Under the Interpretation Act 1978, any reference to statutory provisions in a document will be deemed (subject to contrary intention) to be a reference to those provisions as amended or re-enacted from time to time.

### Eiusdem Generis Rule

Where general words follow a list of specific words, they are taken to be limited to categories of the same kind as the specific words. To avoid this rule, use words like “whatsoever” to emphasise generality.

## Time Computations

Unless there is a contrary intention, courts will hold that:

1. The day on which an event occurs is not included when calculating a period which runs from the occurrence of that event ([[Lester v Garland (1808) 15 Ves 248]]).
2. The period of a ‘month’ (or ‘months’) will end on the day which has the same date in the subsequent month ([[Dodds v Walker [1981] 2 All ER 609]]). For example, two months from 20 March will be 20 May. If this rule would not yield a date (e.g., one month from 31 August), the period is taken to end on the last day of the month in which it expires (e.g., 30 September). The period will end at midnight on the appropriate day.
3. If a period is stated as ‘not less than $x$ months nor more than $y$ months’, the rule outlined in (b) above will apply. For example, if a notice is to be given ‘not more than 3 months nor less than 2 months before cancellation’, then cancellation on 30 November may be notified from 31 August to 30 September (inclusive);
4. notice of ‘at least’ or ‘no fewer than’ $x$ days will usually exclude the day on which notice is given and the day on which it expires. The same effect is obtained by the expression ‘$x$ clear days’;
5. ‘day’ is a calendar day (not just business days).

Best to be very specific about time periods.
