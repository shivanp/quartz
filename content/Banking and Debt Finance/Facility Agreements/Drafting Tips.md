# Drafting Tips

## Creating Document

- Written facility agreement primarily used to benefit the bank.
- Drafting the document traditionally remains in the control of the bank's solicitor.
- LMA precedents for investment grade and leveraged deals widely used as a starting point. Can eliminate some basic negotiation.

## Aims

- Certainty
	- Document must reflect what has been agreed.
	- Can help avoid litigation.
- Ambiguity
	- Often desired by a party, e.g., “reasonableness”.
	- Uncertainty usually resolved in favour of the borrower.
- Workable document
	- Document must be reasonably user-friendly.
	- Use headings and contents table.
	- Drafting must work in practice, e.g., references to business days.

> If using precedents, ensure conformity of terminology and check if any standard clauses have been removed/ amended. 

## Techniques

### Clause Construction

Coode's principle of clause construction:

1. Refer to any exceptions first: e.g. ‘Subject to …’.
2. Next, set out the circumstances or conditions upon which the legal right or obligation depends, using the present tense: e.g. ‘If X does […] and Y does […]’.
3. Next, set out the right or obligation using the active and avoiding the passive: e.g. ‘X must do 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5’.
4. Finally, put the provision into paragraphs and give it a heading.

### Qualifying an Obligation

Many obligations will be drafted as absolute. A borrower may be able to agree a qualifier being added to an obligation. The usual qualifiers are ‘reasonable’, ‘all reasonable’ or ‘best’ endeavours.

| Term                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reasonable endeavours     | Requires a party to adopt and pursue one reasonable course of action to achieve the result, bearing in mind its own commercial interests and the likelihood of success.                                                                                             |
| All reasonable endeavours | Requires a party to explore all avenues reasonably open to it, and explore them to the extent reasonable. |
| Best endeavours           | Most onerous, requires a party to take steps which a prudent, determined and reasonable obligee, acting in its own interests and desiring to achieve that result, would take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It is worth noting that ‘all reasonable’ and ‘best’ endeavours are very similar, and some judges have held there is no practical difference ([[Rhodia International Holdings v Huntsman International LLC [2007] All ER (D) 264]], [[Jet2.com Ltd v Blackpool Airport Ltd [2011] EWHC 1529 (Comm)]]). The onus is on the obligor to show it has met the required level of ‘endeavour’.

Parameters can be specified, but then this leads to yet more negotiation (so usual not to bother).

### Materiality

The borrower may argue that a term constrains it too tightly given commercial realities. So “material” may be drafted in. This holds some risk for a bank; a bank will be wary of calling a default only later to be proven to have acted negligently.

Options:

- Quantify “material”
	- Complicated/ impossible
- Entitle the bank to decide what is material
	- Often by a majority of syndicated banks.

### Would or Might

Some clauses (e.g., certain events of default) will be drafted so that they are triggered by events which ‘might’ have particular consequences (e.g., litigation which might affect B's ability to perform obligations). Borrower may try to argue that “will” or “would” should be used instead.

The parties will usually agree to some form of compromise, such as ‘is reasonably likely to …’, or ‘will in the bank’s opinion’.

### De Minimis

*De minimis non curat lex* is the general legal principle that some breaches of duty or mistakes are too trivial to attract a legal remedy.

The level at which a de minimis is set is crucial; it must allow the borrower sufficient ‘leeway’ to run its day-to-day business, whilst not being so high as to prevent the provision which it modifies from operating effectively. Some de minimis provisions will set an aggregate outstanding maximum to avoid lots of minor breaches being permissible, which together could signal a serious issue.

### Reasonableness

Powerful tool for the borrower to reduce the severity of a provision. Difficult for the bank to objectively decide what is reasonable.

## Key Words

### Subsidiaries

"Subsidiary" will usually be defined in the facility agreement as referring to one of the two definitions in CA 2006:

#### S 1159 (as Supplemented by Sch 6)

For a company to be its subsidiary, the ‘parent’ company must:

 1. hold a majority of the voting rights which can be exercised at a general meeting of the ‘subsidiary’; or
 2. be a member of the ‘subsidiary’ and have the right to appoint or remove its directors who together control more than half the voting rights at board meetings; or
 3. be a member of the ‘subsidiary’ and control, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders, a majority of the voting rights which can be exercised at a general meeting of the ‘subsidiary’; or
 4. be a holding company of another subsidiary which is itself the holding company of the ‘subsidiary’.  
 In determining the voting rights, etc, of the ‘holding company’, the voting rights of its subsidiaries and certain nominees and trustees are taken into account.

#### S 1162 and Sch 7

Definition of subsidiaries in relation to financial statements. The important difference from s 1159 is the concept of ‘subsidiary undertaking’, whereby the ability to exercise a ‘dominant influence’ over a company (or partnership, or other unincorporated association) makes it a ‘subsidiary undertaking’ for accounting purposes. This might include joint-venture arrangements which a company would not usually consider to be a subsidiary.

A bank will favour the wider s 1162 definition. The borrower will ask that provisions only apply to its material subsidiaries (those worth over a certain amount). The bank will want “material subsidiaries from time to time” to catch any that grow.

In [[Enviroco Ltd v Farstad Supply A/S [2009] EWCA Civ 1399]], the Court of Appeal decided that a company ceased to be a subsidiary of its holding company when the subsidiary’s shares were secured to a bank by way of legal mortgage.

### Notwithstanding

Means “in spite of”. Antonym: “subject to”.

### Definitions

- “Means” gives a precise definition.
- “Includes” makes the definition broader and less certain.

### S 61 LPA 1925

Section 61 of the LPA 1925 applies, amongst other things, to all deeds and contracts made after 1925 and, unless the context otherwise requires, will deem:

1. ‘month’ to mean a calendar month;
2. ‘person’ to include a corporation;
3. the singular to include the plural (and vice versa);
4. the masculine to include the feminine (and vice versa).

Under the Interpretation Act 1978, any reference to statutory provisions in a document will be deemed (subject to contrary intention) to be a reference to those provisions as amended or re-enacted from time to time.

### Eiusdem Generis Rule

Where general words follow a list of specific words, they are taken to be limited to categories of the same kind as the specific words. To avoid this rule, use words like “whatsoever” to emphasise generality.

## Time Computations

Unless there is a contrary intention, courts will hold that:

1. The day on which an event occurs is not included when calculating a period which runs from the occurrence of that event ([[Lester v Garland (1808) 15 Ves 248]]).
2. The period of a ‘month’ (or ‘months’) will end on the day which has the same date in the subsequent month ([[Dodds v Walker [1981] 2 All ER 609]]). For example, two months from 20 March will be 20 May. If this rule would not yield a date (e.g., one month from 31 August), the period is taken to end on the last day of the month in which it expires (e.g., 30 September). The period will end at midnight on the appropriate day.
3. If a period is stated as ‘not less than $x$ months nor more than $y$ months’, the rule outlined in (b) above will apply. For example, if a notice is to be given ‘not more than 3 months nor less than 2 months before cancellation’, then cancellation on 30 November may be notified from 31 August to 30 September (inclusive);
4. notice of ‘at least’ or ‘no fewer than’ $x$ days will usually exclude the day on which notice is given and the day on which it expires. The same effect is obtained by the expression ‘$x$ clear days’;
5. ‘day’ is a calendar day (not just business days).

Best to be very specific about time periods.
