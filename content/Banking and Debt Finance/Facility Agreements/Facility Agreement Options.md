# Facility Agreement Options

## Types of Facility

3 types of general purpose loan facility:

1. Overdraft
2. Term loan
3. Revolving credit facility.

A loan facility may be committed or uncommitted.

> [!defn]
> A facility is committed if the facility agreement, once executed, obliges the bank to advance monies at the borrower's request. If the bank has some discretion, the facility is uncommitted.

### Overdraft

- A tool to aid cash flow to aid any shortfall in working capital.
- Uncommitted facility
- “On demand” $\rightarrow$ must be repaid whenever the bank demands, even f the borrower has not defaulted.
- Usually provided on the bank's standard terms, with little room for negotiation.
- Subject to a maximum aggregate amount which may be borrowed at any one time
- May be subject to a “clean-down” provision.
- Relatively expensive way to borrow.

### Term Loan

- Provides a specified capital sum over a set period (term) with an agreed repayment schedule.
- Usually a lump sum borrowed for a specific purpose.
- Committed facility
- Borrower allowed availability period/ commitment period after executing the facility agreement during which it can draw down a lump sum up to a specified amount.
- May be an extended availability period during which the money can be drawn down in portions (tranches, advances, loans).
- Schedule of repayment:
	- Amortisation - repayment in equal amounts at regular intervals over the term of the loan. Repayment “holiday” at the start of the loan.
	- Balloon repayment – instalment amount increases towards maturity
	- Bullet repayment – at maturity.
- Once capital has been repaid, it cannot be re-borrowed.
- Refinancing might be agreed.
- Generally term is $\leq 5$ years
- Not usually “on demand” - the bank cannot withdraw the facility unless the borrower defaults.
- Might be a multicurrency term loan; drawn amounts may be redenominated.
- Interest on a term loan usually floats at a fixed percentage above LIBOR/ SONIA.

### Revolving Credit Facility

- Provides a maximum aggregate amount of capital available over a specified period.
- Allows a borrower to draw down and repay tranches of the available capital.
- Combines flexibility of an overdraft with certainty of a term loan.
- Borrower can save money by not drawing the whole loan at once.
- Each tranche usually borrowed for a short period of time (e.g., 1-6 months) after which it is technically repayable. But if the borrower has not defaulted, the tranche to be repaid can immediately re-drawn. Known as a “rollover”.
- With a revolving credit facility, the utilisation and repayment will be subject to more restrictions than an overdraft:
	- Minimum notice periods before each utilisation
	- Max/ min amounts which may be drawn down in one tranche.
	- Minimum period for which an amount must be borrowed before repaid.
	- Maximum number of tranches which may be drawn at any time.
	- Control over the frequency and timing of repayment.
- Bank will usually charge a “commitment fee”, calculated as a % of the undrawn facility from time to time.
- Clean down provision may be included
	- Ensures the money borrowed under an RCF is used for working capital rather than long-term capital.
	- e.g., borrower has to reduce facilities to £0 for 5 consecutive business days a year.

### Ancillary Facilities

Syndicated facility agreements may include both a term loan and an RCF in one document.

## Syndicated Facilities

Large or sophisticated facilities are usually provided by a group of banks known as a syndicate. Not unusual to find syndicates of >30 banks.

### Structure

- Usually, one or more banks act as the “arranger(s)”.
- This structure is known as primary syndication.
- Syndicate members participate in the syndicate on common terms and with common documentation.
- Each syndicate member only liable for its own lending obligations; will not undertake any responsibility for other syndicate members' commitments.

#### Arranger

The arranger/ mandated lead arranger/ MLA is the bank responsible for:

1. advising the borrower as to the type of facility required;
2. finding other banks to form the initial syndicate; and
3. negotiating the broad terms of the loan.

#### Secondary Syndication

Once the facility has been made available, the participating banks might sell part or all of their commitment to other banks or institutional lenders – secondary syndication.

But a borrower will usually require the arranger to retain a substantial part of the facility, known as the “minimum hold”, so the arranger has a stake in organising the facility and ensuring the syndicate runs smoothly.

> [!action]
> The facility agreement should specifically state that the arranger does not owe any other syndicate members any common law fiduciary duties. 

#### Administrative Agent

Common for one bank, known as the administrative agent, to act as agent for the others in the day-to-day running of the loan. Must act as the:

1. Interpreter (communicating between borrower and syndicate)
2. Counsellor (dealing with any practical problems)
3. Policeman (monitoring borrower's compliance)
4. Postman
5. Record keeper
6. Conduit for payments.

Carries out the duties and responsibilities of an agent. But the facility agreement will contain provisions to limit the relationship, known as “exculpatory provisions”:

1. Agent will not want any obligation to act unless instructed by the syndicate
2. Agent will want the ability to delegate its functions and to take professional advice if necessary
3. Agent will want syndicate members to take responsibility for their own credit assessment of the borrower.
4. Syndicate members to complete their own KYC (Know Your Customer) checks to comply with money laundering obligations.
5. Agent permitted to take an agency fee and indemnity for costs, liabilities and losses, from the borrower
6. To the extent that costs, losses and liabilities are not recovered from the borrower under (e) above, the agent will want an indemnity from the syndicate;
7. Agent will always want a right to resign, and the syndicate will want the right to replace it. This will entail provisions dealing with notice periods and the procedure for appointing a successor (either by the agent or by the majority lenders depending on the circumstances). Borrower given consultation rights on any replacement to the agent.

#### Security Trustee

> [!defn]
> If a syndicated loan is secured, one entity (usually one of the syndicate banks) will usually hold the security on trust for the whole syndicate. This entity is known as the ‘security trustee’.

Fiduciary duties imposed are more extensive than those of a simple agent.

#### Taking a Role

Several advantages;

- Prestige
- Ability to charge fees
- Relationship with the borrower

### Tombstones

Once a large deal is closed, announced by way of an advert in the financial press with details. Cast in Perspex block and given to parties and advisers. Now less common.

### Liability of Arrangers

Arranger will provide information about the borrower in an “information memorandum” (info memo). Usually contains financial information, general information and market information.

The arranger is potentially liable for any wrong information the info memo contains which is relied on by the lenders deciding to joint the syndicate. Claims may be brought for misrepresentation or negligence. There is also a tortious duty of care ([[Sumiomo Bnk Ltd v Banque Bruxelles Lambers SA, 1996]]).

So it is standard for a clause in the info memo to state:

- the borrower has supplied the information and confirms it is true, complete and accurate; has been prepared with reasonable care; is not misleading; and does not omit anything material;
- the borrower confirms that any assumptions or projections it makes are reasonable and in good faith;
- the arranger has not independently verified the information; does not make any representations or undertakings with respect to it; does not take responsibility for it; and accepts no liability for loss caused by reliance on it; and
- participants in the facility acknowledge the info memo is not a valuation of the borrower’s credit; that it is not a recommendation to participate; and that they should make their own independent assessment of the documentation and the borrower.

Effectiveness of such disclaimers:

- Courts tend to interpret limitation clauses strictly.
- UCTA 1977~ disclaimer of liability for negligence or misrepresentation must be reasonable.
- Arranger is almost certainly under duties anyway not to withhold relevant information and to answer fully any specific questions.
- In [[IFE Fund SA v Goldman Sachs International [2007] EWCA Civ 811]], Court of Appeal ruled that disclaimer language commonly used in information memoranda is effective to deny an arranger’s liability for the accuracy of information and to deny responsibility for updating it.

## Leveraged Acquisition Facilities

Usually involves more than one source of lending to raise the maximum amount of debt. Consists of a senior facility providing a term loan and revolving facility ("revolver") and a mezzanine facility providing a second term loan. Senior lenders get first right to repayment and control the enforcement process on default. Mezzanine lenders get a higher interest rate. But mezzanine facilities rare recently - there is usually a senior facility and a high yield bond.

## Short-term Lending

Other forms:

- Standby facility – backup facility, may include a utilisation fee.
- Bankers' acceptance – bill of exchange which the bank has agreed to be responsible for paying which it falls due. Borrower must eventually pay back the bank.
- Swing-line facility – made available to a company which has a commercial paper programme (IOU). Can be used on very short notice to allow the borrower to pay back any maturing commercial paper which it is unable to reissue (rollover).

## Anatomy of Facility Agreement

Provisions in a loan document almost all designed to protect the bank's position.

### Bank Concerns

Will want to ensure:

1. Fees are paid
2. Interest received on theloan
3. Loan capital returned.

Aims best served by ensuring that:

- Loan monies only used for a specific purpose
- Borrower doesn't do anything financially risky
- Borrower monitored to give early warning of any possibility of default
- All monies due to the bank secured over the borrower's assets.

4 main types of clause:

1. Mechanics clauses
2. Margin protection clauses
3. General protection clauses
4. Boilerplate clauses.

#### Borrower's Concerns

Primary concern: flexibility. Main areas to negotiate relate to the monitoring of and restrictions on the borrower.

## Matched Funding

Most facility agreements assume that when the borrower requests a utilisation, the facility banks will fund their commitment by borrowing the sum from other banks on the London interbank market. Loans on interbank market typically short term (~6 months). Interest payable on successive interbank loans recovered from the borrower.

This assumption drives lots of provisions, such as interest periods, repetition of representations, repayment, prepayment and break costs.
