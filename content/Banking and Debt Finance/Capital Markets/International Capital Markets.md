# International Capital Markets

## What is a Capital Market

- Colloquially, capital markets are used to refer to debt and equity securities only.
- Market – the borrowing requirements of potential issuers and funds available from investors
- Size of market – funds available and tradability of securities

### Debt Securities Vs Loan Facilities

- In capital markets, the borrower issues a document evidencing the debt obligation in return for money received from lenders. The borrower is called the issuer.
- Wide variety of institutions and individuals “lend” by purchasing securities on the capital markets. Lenders known as investors.
- High liquidity, potentially low interest rates.
- Most asset sales (of loan agreements) have a limited market, whereas capital markets can easily trade debt.
- Size and maturities of debt can be more varied
- Debt securities can be more varied than for commercial loans
- Listed bond issue involves publicity; loan agreement can be confidential.
- Undertakings and events of default in capital markets, less onerous and restrictive than facility agreement. Note there is a trustee with a basic role of overseeing standard undertakings.

## Domestic and Euromarkets

```ad-defn
title: Domestic market
A market in a currency in its currency of origin. 
```

```ad-defn
title: Euromarkets
"Euro" means currency held outside the currency's country of origin. Euromarkets are international markets. 
```

- Eurocurrency market means the FX market.
- Eurosecurities are international securities (e.g., dollar denominated bond issued by Tesco, or sterling bond issued by Tesco intended to raise sterling from overseas investors).

### Origins of Euromarkets

- US govt putting strict controls on interest rates and high taxes on non-nationals issuing bonds in the USA in 60s and 70s.
- So companies issued dollar denominated bonds outside US to avoid the tax.

### Foreign Securities

Eurocurrency instrument taps into money held outside its country of origin (i.e., the country of origin of the currency). So a dollar denominated bond issued anywhere except US is a eurocurrency instrument.

However, if a non-British company issues a sterling instrument (to ‘domestic’ investors) in the UK, this will raise currency in its country of origin, and so it is not a ‘euro’ issue but rather a ‘foreign’ issue. Colloquially, “bulldog”, “Yankee”, “samurai”.

## Debt and Equity Securities

### Equity Securities

- Essentially a non-returnable investment
- An investor has no absolute right to receive a return on its investment
- Investor will rank behind all other creditors of the company in the event of winding up.
- Usually voting rights.

### Debt Securities

- Maturity date on which the issuer must redeem the security by repaying the investor
- Under security T&Cs, an investor will have the right to receive a regular return on its investment, or the investment may be issued at a discount to its face value on redemption.
- May be secured, but unlikely
- Investor does not generally take any equity in the issuer or have any rights over the issuer (other than to call an event of default if not paid/ basic undertakings breached).

## Bonds and Notes

```ad-defn
Certificate of debt under which the issuer obligates itself to pay the principal to the bondholder on a specified date.
```

Characteristics:

- Debt obligation made by way of a transferable instrument
- Sold to a wide number of investors through a syndicate
- Marketable instrument
- May or may not be listed
- Interest bearing/ issued at a discount to face value at redemption

```ad-note
title: Terminology
Note used to be reserved for securities with a short maturity/ floating rate coupon and bond for everything else. Now terms used interchangeably. 

Refer to:
- ‘floating rate notes’, not ‘floating rate bonds’;
- a ‘global note’, rather than a ‘global bond’;
- securities issued under a programme as ‘notes’, not ‘bonds’;
- securities issued under a securitisation as ‘notes’, not ‘bonds’.

If in doubt, use the term ‘note’ rather than ‘bond’.
```

### Fixed Rate Bonds

- Rate of interest yielded fixed at the time of issue and does not change during the life of the bond.
- Interest is usually payable annually semi-annually in arrears.
- Interest rate fixed at issue will depend on:
	- Market conditions
	- Issuer's credit rating
	- Length of maturity of the bond

### Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)

Pay interest which fluctuates according to a benchmark (LIBOR, now typically SONIA) - e.g., SONIA + 0.5%. Raate recalculated each time interest is paid. Interest usually paid at least quarterly.

Appealing to financial instutitions which lend at a floating rate and want to attain matched funding.

#### Reverse FRNs

Interest payable on bond rises/ falls in the opposite direction to a benchmark level.

- Used to speculate on general interest rates
- Used to hedge currency exposure.

### Variable Rate Bonds

Bond with a rate of interest which varies throughout the term of the bond, but the variation is restricted/ designated to alter in accordance with a schedule.

#### Step-up/ Step-down Bonds

In a ‘step-up’ bond, the initial fixed interest rate moves up to another (pre-determined) fixed rate after a given time.

#### Collars

A bond which is subject to a ‘collar’ is similar to an FRN in that its rate of interest will vary in accordance with a benchmark rate (e.g., SONIA or LIBOR); however, the rate of interest payable is subject to an upper and a lower limit. These limits are known as the ‘cap’ and ‘floor’ respectively.

### Zero Coupon Bonds

Do not pay any interest. Bond issued at a discount. Return achieved on maturity. Bond appreciates as the date of maturity becomes closer.

```ad-tip
As interest rates fall, the price of a zero coupon bond already in issue will rise since the yield it offers can be lower but still compete with equivalent interest-bearing bonds. 
```

Zero coupon bonds advantage: investor taxed on capital gain rather than income.

### Equity Linked Bonds

Some bonds are linked to the equity (share capital) of the issuer. provide an investor with the opportunity to obtain some form of equity interest in the issuer. 3 main types:

1. Convertible bonds
2. Bonds with warrants; and
3. Exchangeable bonds.

#### Convertible Bonds

Provide the bondholder with the option to convert the bond into shares in the issuer at some stage after issue. The option to convert usually exists throughout the life of the bond.

Once a bondholder converts, the issuer will create new shares to be given in exchange for the bond, which is then redeemed in consideration for the issue of shares.

```ad-action
- The directors should ensure there are no restrictions on allotment in the articles.
- New shares are effectively issued for cash consideration so existing shareholders may have pre-emption rights to disapply. 
```

A convertible bond will also specify the ‘conversion price’. This is the price at which the shares a bondholder receives in exchange for its bond will be valued upon conversion.

The conversion price of the shares will invariably be higher than their market value at the time the convertible bond is issued. Difference: “conversion premium”".

Attraction to investors: potential high return with limited risk. If the issuer performs well, the bondholder can take advantage of any resultant rise in its share price by exercising conversion rights selling shares received on conversion.

Issuer attraction:

- Interest rate offered on a convertible bond will be less than an equivalent non-convertible bond.
- Equity financing can be deferred if the issuer feels the share price is currently undervalued.

```ad-note
title: CoCo bonds
Convertible capital bonds (also known as ‘CoCo bonds’) are a type of convertible bond that converts into equity at the happening of a defined event as opposed to the issuer’s or investor’s option. The trigger point is typically related to a bank’s regulatory position.
```

#### Bonds with Warrants (options)

Bonds issued as 2 securities:

- Interest-bearing security; and
- An option to purchase shares in the issuer which can be exercised by the bondholder.

The bond pays a fixed rate of interest and has a specified maturity and will always remain a debt obligation regardless of whether the warrants are exercised. Provide the bondholder with a right to buy shares at a pre-determined price – either within a specified time period (European option) or at any time (American option).

The options provide an incentive to purchase the bond and allow the issuer to have a lower coupon. Option detachable and can be traded separately.

#### Exchangeable Bonds

The shares for which the bond can be exchanged are not shares in the issuer but shares in a related company (parent/ subsidiary). Rare.

## Other Debt Securities

### Medium Term Notes (MTNs)

Usually issued in several series through a programme. Essentially, an MTN programme involves the issuer and an arranger agreeing a set of legal documentation under which the issuer can issue notes of varying currencies and maturities.

The MTN programme may provide that the notes are issued in either bearer or registered form; and if in bearer form, they may be held as global notes or in definitive form.

The documentation specifies the T&Cs of the series of notes and provides an information memorandum to be used for selling the notes to investors (to be updated periodically). The programme will also appoint a number of ‘dealers’, one of whom (although not always the same one) acts as a lead manager to each separate issue of notes.

The advantage of an MTN programme is that it allows an issuer to issue a wide variety of notes at very short notice (since the majority of the necessary documentation is already in place).

### Commercial Paper

Type of security providing issuers with short-term borrowing in capital markets. Bank sets up programme for a company. Dealers appointed who are responsible for finding buyers of the commercial paper in return for commission. Not usually underwritten, and the issuer is not under any obligation to issue.

Usually unsecured and sold at a discount rather than being interest bearing. Almost always in global form. Typical maturity of 1-2 months.

Whilst the programme specifies a maximum amount of paper which may be issued, it is a ‘rolling’ maximum limiting the amount which can be outstanding at any one time.

### Certificates of Deposit

Certificates (i.e., receipts) issued by a bank or building society in return for a deposit of money made with them in the form of a loan. Negotiable instruments issued in bearer form.

CDs issued and payable in the UK (known as ‘London CDs’) usually have a maturity of no more than five years and may bear interest (which is more common), or be issued at a discount.

The advantage to a lender of investing spare cash in a CD is that it receives a very good rate of interest – because the loan not repayable until the CD matures – but can recover capital at any time by selling the CD in the market. CDs are unsecured. If trading in the London market, must follow British Bankers' Association guidelines.

### Bills of Exchange

Originally an instrument recognising a trade debt. A seller draws up a document under which the buyer promises to pay for them after a specific period (e.g., 3 months). Credit called a "trade bill of exchange". Can be traded. Some bills of exchange will have payment of the amount due under them guaranteed (or ‘accepted’) by a bank. These are known as ‘bank bills’ or ‘accepted bills’. Because they carry less risk of non-repayment, accepted bills will be sold at a higher price (i.e., less discount).

### Treasury Bills

Used by governments for short term borrowing to balance cash flows. No coupon; sold at a discount.

## Primary and Secondary Markets

When a security is issued it is offered on the "primary market". Further trading = secondary market. An instrument with an established secondary market is usually known as a ‘marketable instrument’. Marketability is v important.

## Clearing Systems

Originally all eurobond took the form of paper certificates. Represented a debt to be paid by the issuer to whoever possessed the bond at maturity. These definitive ‘bearer bonds’ are difficult to trade rapidly in large numbers and are vulnerable to theft or loss.

‘Clearing systems’ were developed which allowed the bonds to be left safely in a vault and for trading to take place through accounts. There are a number of clearing systems worldwide which deal with trading bearer (and other) securities. However, in the international eurosecurities markets, there are two systems of paramount importance: the Euroclear system and the Clearstream Service (which is part of the Deutsche Börse Group), commonly referred to as ‘Euroclear’ and ‘Clearstream’.

### Operation of Clearing Systems

Euroclear & Clearstream accept most common forms of security actively traded on capital markets.

The primary purpose of a clearing system is to avoid the physical handling of bearer instruments on issue and on subsequent trading. Therefore, the actual bond certificates (which may be in definitive bearer form or global form) are invariably passed on to a bank known as a ‘depositary’ for safekeeping, and the clearing system works through a series of ‘book entries’ (akin to depositing cash with your bank and debiting your account to pay debts rather than withdrawing cash).

To participate, an investor will have 2 accounts with the system:

1. Securities clearance account to and from which securities are credited.
2. Cash account through which all payments from sale and purchase of securities must pass.

Each issue of securities is allocated a unique code number, known as its ISIN (International Securities Identification Number), from which is derived the ‘Common Code’. The Common Code is used as a label to identify the particular issue each time the clearing system is instructed to deal in securities.

If a bondholder wants to sell some bonds on the secondary market, it instructs the clearer, which reduces the seller’s securities clearance account by the requisite number of securities and credits them to the securities clearance account of the purchaser. Simultaneously, the cash account of the purchaser is debited, and the cash account of the seller credited.

On the closing date of a new issue, the requisite number of bonds will be credited to the securities clearance accounts of the syndicate members and can then be transferred to the accounts of the investors.

The clearing systems also keep a record of interest payment dates and redemption dates for each issue, and will ‘present’ the securities for payment when appropriate.

The clearing systems will also act on investors’ instructions with respect to any options or conversion rights attached to the securities.

## International Capital Markets Association (ICMA)

- Formed in July 2005.
- Association for financial institutions which play an active role, usually as managers, underwriters and traders, in the primary and secondary bond markets.
- Trade association, as opposed to a statutory body, created by participants in the international capital markets with a view to establishing recognised standards of market practice.
- Membership of ICMA brings a financial institution the status and recognition.
- Self-regulating body: ultimate sanction for non-compliance is expulsion $\rightarrow$ very problematic for the offender because they're an outcast.
- Publishes recommendations in a handbook, covering:
	- Timing of a bond issue (between stages)
	- Minimum content of some documents
	- Timescale to be allowed for payment of fees and commissions.

## Issuers

- Companies
- Governments/ sovereign entities
- Public authorities
- Supranationals

## Credit Ratings

Investors are sensitive to risk, so most issuers and/or debt security issues will be given a credit rating. Dominated by:

- Standard & Poor's
- Moody's
- Fitch.

The credit rating is an opinion on the risk of default on payment. Ratings split into “investment grade” and “speculative grade”.

| Ratings agency | Investment grade | Speculative grade (junk) |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| S&P            | AAA, AA, A, BBB  | BB, B, CCC, CC, C, D     |
| Moody's        | Aaa, Aa, A, Baa  | Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C        |

A rating is usually assigned at launch of the issue. The rating given to an issue is then periodically reviewed.

2008 exposed that ratings agencies were paid by the issuer to give a rating, giving rise to something of a conflict of interest. In the UK, FCA supervises rating agencies.
