# Bonds - Legal

## Form of a Bond

The first eurobond issued in 1963. Early investors held printed bearer certificates with tear-off coupons. These certificates are known as ‘definitive bearer bonds’. Then clearing houses came along (late 60s, early 70s).

Bonds typically take:

1. temporary global form, followed by either:
	1. permanent global form, or
	2. definitive form (which may be bearer or registered); or
2. permanent global form from the outset.

### Temporary Global Form

#### What

- The total debt obligation of the issuer will, instead, usually start life as a single document known as a ‘temporary global note’.
- Document representing all the bonds to be offered under that issue
- Executed by an authorised officer of the issuer and authenticated by the fiscal agent/ principal paying agent.
- T&Cs which apply to the bonds also incorporated in the temporary global note.
- Schedule attached, on which the fiscal agent/ principal paying agent can record all exchanges of the temporary global note and interest payments.

#### Why

##### Time Constraints

- Many bond issues (in particular, eurobond issues) have a timescale of three to five weeks between launch (i.e., when the offer is announced) and closing (i.e., issue of the bonds).
- This timetable is primarily driven by market practice: issuing a bond is intended to be a relatively quick way for a borrower to raise finance, and the markets therefore have an expectation to fulfil.
- However, such a short timetable makes it difficult to complete the security printing and necessary ‘authentication’ of the certificates which represents the final definitive form of a bearer bond.
- The issued temporary global note can be placed in a clearing system.

##### Selling Restrictions

- Most jurisdictions impose restrictions on securities being offered or sold within that jurisdiction.
- Many of these restrictions are imposed on issues made to the public in order to protect unsophisticated investors/ policies of investment control or taxation.
- To avoid contravening any restrictions which might apply to it, a bond will include contractual restrictions on the institutions selling the issue (the ‘syndicate’). These are known as ‘selling restrictions’.

```ad-note
The most commonly applicable selling restrictions are those imposed under US tax and securities laws. Some of these require that definitive bonds cannot be delivered for a period (usually 40 days) after issue (known as a ‘lock-up’ period). More commonly, there will be a restricted period during which definitive bonds may be offered only to certain investors. So temporary global note helps. 
```

Once any lock-up period expires, the temporary global note must be exchanged for either a permanent global note (permanent version of the temporary global note), or bonds in definitive form (separate certificates representing each bond).

#### Permanent Global Note

Word processed document prepared by the lead manager's solicitor representing all the bonds in issue. Issued on the closing date of the issue and held by a bank called the “common depository” for safekeeping.

The main advantage of using a permanent global note rather than definitive bonds is cost, since the permanent global note is not security printed.

But leaves bondholders without a bearer instrument with which to prove ownership. In circumstances where it is important that the investor has legal ownership of the debt obligation represented by the bond, the terms and conditions require the issuer to print definitive bearer bonds and distribute them to the investors. The permanent global notes state the circumstances in which definitives should be printed.

```ad-warning
title: Potential issue
Even if the global note states that the issuer must print definitive bonds (providing the investor with legal ownership), the issuer may refuse to comply with that condition.
```

Solution:

1. Provide investors with direct rights of enforcement in the text of the global note itself.
2. Issuer executes a unilateral deed of covenant (deed poll) in favour of the bondholders from time to time. Contains a declaration by the issue to pay those shown as investors on the clearing systems $\rightarrow$ provides a contractual link between issuer and investors.
3. Appoint a trustee to the issue, which holds the issuer covenant to pay on trust for the bondholders. The trustee can then enforce on the bondholders' behalf.

#### Definitive Form

A bond issued in “definitive form” can be a bearer or registered instrument.

##### Bearer Bonds

The most familiar bearer instrument to most people is currency (e.g., a £5 note). Bearer bonds are similar. Security printed documents to make forgery difficult. Issuer’s debt obligation is printed on the bond itself and ownership can be transferred by physical delivery.

Features:

- A promise to pay
	- Signed by at least 1 officer of the issuer - as part of the security printing
	- Each instrument individually authenticated (signed) by the fiscal agent/ paying agent and not valid until this is done.
- T&Cs
	- Usually printed on the reverse, together with the addresses of the relevant paying agents.
- Coupons
	- If the bond bears interest, coupons are printed on the RHS of the bearer bond which are torn off and surrendered to the paying interest to claim payment.
- Talons
	- The maximum number of coupons which can be attached to a eurobond is 27 (under ICMA rules).
	- If a bond carries more than 27 interest payment dates, the final coupon (at the top left of the coupon sheet next to the bond) will be known as a ‘talon’. The talon can be exchanged for a further sheet of coupons.

##### Registered Bonds

Create a promise to pay the person whose name appears on a register of bondholders held by the issuer (or its agent for this purpose) rather than the holder of the actual bond certificate. Registered bonds can be transferred only by an entry on the register; title will not pass by physical delivery of the bond instrument. Rare.

## Legal Nature of a Bond

### Transferability

2 methods:

- Transfer by physical delivery – bearer instrument.
- Transfer by registration – registrable instrument.

### Negotiability

Usually, the jurisdiction in which the ‘negotiation’ takes place is relevant: in the case of a bearer bond, this will be the place where the bond is delivered. In a conflict of laws situation, negotiable instruments are usually treated as chattels because the debt claim is represented by a tangible document rather than a simple ‘book entry’.

- By statute
	- The Bills of Exchange Act 1882 confers negotiability on bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques – but bonds are generally not certain enough to fall within these provisions.
- By mercantile custom
	- It is an established principle of English common law that an instrument can achieve negotiability simply because it is customarily treated as negotiable in the ‘markets’ in which it is usually traded.
	- So definitive bearer bonds are negotiable by mercantile custom.

#### Consequences

The consequences of negotiability work in favour of a transferee who purchases the bond bona fide, for value and without any actual notice of a defect in title (known as a ‘holder in due course’). A negotiable bond purchased by a ‘holder in due course’ will have the following benefits:

1. the purchaser can obtain better title than the seller;
2. the purchaser will take a clean legal title to the bond and is entitled to payment in full, notwithstanding any claims of set-off or other defence which the issuer may have had against any previous holder;
3. the purchaser can sue the issuer directly in the case of a dispute over the bond, and does not need to join the transferor in a claim;
4. if a ‘holder in due course’ presents a stolen bond, the issuer must pay out on that bond as well as on any replacement bond it has issued to the original bondholder.

```ad-action
An issuer will not usually provide a replacement bond without first obtaining an indemnity from the original bondholder to the effect that they will recompense the issuer if it has to pay out on the original bond.

## Registered Vs Bearer Bonds

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title                         | Bona fide purchaser for value without notice of a bearer bond can obtain better title than the seller. | Not a negotiable instrument, so buyer does not obtain good title if the seller stole the bond certificate.       |
| Claims and defences of issuer | Negotiable bearer bonds always sold free from any claim the issuer may have had.                       | Purchaser is (theoretically) subject to the rights the issuer might have against the transferor                  |
| Priorities                    | Purchaser takes the bond free of any equities (3rd party claims).                                      | Purchaser only taks the bond free of competing interests of which they had no actual or constructive notice.     |
| Anonymity                     | Can be held anonymously.                                                                               | Issuer will know the identity of a registered holder (but beneficial ownership may lie behind a nominee holder). |
| Transfer                      | By delivery                                                                                            | Execution of an instrument of transfer and filing of the instrument and original bond certificate with the issuer/ its agent for that purpose, and an amendment to the register.                                                                                                                  |

## Bearer Bonds in Clearing Systems

It is unusual for definitive bearer bonds to be printed and held in a depositary. Some investors may not actually be ‘participants’ in a clearing system, but will rely on a financial institution which is a participant to act as their nominee.

A definitive bearer bond transaction will then involve a chain of parties:

```mermaid
graph LR
id1(Investor) --> id2(Participant) --> id3(Clearing System) --> id4(Depository)
```

The investors (i.e., bondholders) give the bond to a participant (i.e., an entity holding accounts with the clearing system – assuming the investor is not a participant itself), which must give the bond to the clearing system (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream), which in turn gives the instrument to a depositary bank for safekeeping.

If any of these parties goes into liquidation in possession of the investor’s bearer securities, the investor will be left to claim as an unsecured creditor. The way to avoid this risk is to ensure that the proprietary rights over the securities remain with the investor and are not vested in any of the other parties in the chain.

### Investor – Participant

- Law is the governing law chosen in the documentation.
- Under English law, TRUST: the deposit of bearer securities with a participant will result in the investor passing legal title to the participant, but the investor retaining beneficial ownership.
	- The participant therefore takes all the rights against the issuer such as payment of coupon and principal, and any conversion rights.
	- Participant must account for payments received and transfer security back at the investor's request.
	- The investor can also demand the return of the bonds in the event of the participant’s liquidation and they will not become part of the participant’s general pool of assets.

### Participant – Clearing System

- Euroclear is Belgian, Clearstream is Luxembourg, so these are the respective governing laws of the clearing systems.
- The participants retain a proprietary right of ownership in the securities credited to their securities clearance account.
- Therefore, if Euroclear should become insolvent, the participants will not be unsecured creditors but will have the right to the return of the securities which are credited to their securities account.

### Clearing Systems – Depository

The final link in the chain is that between the clearing system and the depositary bank. This relationship is subject not only to the local law of the relevant clearing system, but also to the law of the jurisdiction in which the depository is situated.

```ad-action
Participant msut ensure that the proprietary rights in the bearer securities are not in any way transferred to the depository bank. Often participants take a legal opinion from a local lawyer to this effect.
