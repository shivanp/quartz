# Bond Issue

Eurobond – it is a bond denominated in a globally recognised currency which is not the currency of the country in which the bond is issued. Took off in the 80s (Liar's Poker).

## Parties

### Issuer

- If the issuer is a debut issuer, prospectus will need drafting from scratch
- If there have been previous issues, can just update the prospectus.
- For eurobonds, if the company does not have use for the denominated currency, derivative/ FX transaction entered into to exchange into local currency.

### Lead Manager

- Investment bank
- Similar role to the arranger in a syndicated loan.
- Responsible for arranging bond issue and managing process
- Will advise the issuer on structure, timing, price etc.
- If the issue is to be listed, the lead manager will usually be the ‘sponsor’ required by the UKLA to provide confirmations for listing.

### Syndicate

- Lead managers recruits co-managers to join a syndicate.
- Distribution network for the issue – book building for the issue.
- Usually the syndicate underwrites the issue (so will take the bonds if no buyers can be found).
- The names of the syndicate will appear on the prospectus in order of contribution to the amount of the issue that they have sold.
- Occasionally (usually for high yield bonds) the syndicate will only have to use ‘reasonable endeavours’ to sell the securities.

### Fiscal Agent and Trustee

A bond issue will use either a fiscal agent (under a fiscal agency agreement), or a trustee (under a trust deed).

#### Fiscal Agent

The fiscal agent is appointed by, and is the representative and agent of, the issuer and not the bondholders.

- It is primarily responsible for paying principal and interest to the bondholders.
- Administrative functions (e.g., publishing notices, acting as depository).
- Fiscal agency agreement will stipulate that the agent does not owe the bondholders any duty of care.

#### Trustee

A trustee is initially chosen and appointed by the issuer (through its advisers) but represents the interests of the bondholders.

- The property held on trust is the issuer’s covenant to pay the bondholders.
- The trustee’s powers and duties are recorded in a trust deed, but it will also owe the bondholders a duty of care under common law trust principles.
- In a bond transaction, the trustee is likely to be either a professional trust association (e.g., The Law Debenture Trust Corporation), or a subsidiary of a bank or other financial institution with this function.

#### Choice

Fiscal agent usually used because cheaper. But trustee used where a fiscal agent is insufficient:

1. Secured issues
	- If the bonds are secured, a trustee is required to hold the security. This is primarily due to the impracticality of providing individual bondholders with a right to part of the security.
	- The trustee holds the security on trust for all the bondholders from time to time.
	- A fiscal agent cannot perform this function since it is the agent of the issuer and so acts in the issuer’s interests.
2. Subordinated issues
	 - If bonds are to be issued which are subordinated to the repayment of another bond issue, the same trustee may be appointed to both senior and junior issues to ensure effective subordination.
	 - Alternatively, achieve this contractually through the issue terms (contingent debt)

#### Trust Advantages

For issuer:

- Only the trustee can act in the event of a default by the issuer $\rightarrow$ more considered approach towards default than if the bondholders could individually bring claims.
- Trust instrument may provide the trustee authority to waive technical events of default where fit.
- [[Concord Trust v The Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc [2005] UKHL 27]]: if a trustee mistakenly called an event of default this is not a breach of contract, but simply an ‘ineffective action’.
- More flexible: A trustee can be given power to agree certain amendments to the terms of a bond without calling a meeting of bondholders.

For bondholders:

- Professional entity to pursue the issuer on an event of default. Individual action can be expensive and difficult; class actions are hard.
- Trustee more likely to achieve a moratorium/ negotiated resolution than individual bondholders.
- If bondholders need to decide something collectively, the trustee can chair
- Role of trustee avoids a powerful bondholder negotiating a better deal at the expense of minority bondholders on a default
- Trustee has investigative and monitoring powers. The common law duty to act with due diligence in the best interests of the beneficiaries (i.e., the bondholders) is still applicable irrespective of the contractual requirements of the trust deed.

#### Fiscal Agent Advantages

- Cost
	- Trustee requires its own solicitor to advise on trust documentation.
	- Competition to take the prestigious role of fiscal agent. Often banks will do it for free, bundled with another role they are given.

### Listing Agent

When listing on certain exchanges a listing agent must be appointed by an issuer to communicate with the listing authority on its behalf, to lodge the necessary documents with the listing authority, and to advise the issuer on the listing rules and process.

### Principal Paying Agent and Paying Agents

A paying agent is an agent of the issuer responsible for co-ordinating payments of principal and interest under the bond. Payment received by the issuer and distributed to paying agents, who pay bondholders in their jurisdictions.

If an issuer uses a fiscal agent, it will usually take the role of principal paying agent.

### Depository and Common Depository

A depository is a bank appointed on behalf of a clearing system dealing with a particular issue to act as ‘safe keeper’ of the temporary global note, the permanent global note, and any definitive bearer bonds traded through a clearing system. If an issue uses more than one clearing system, each system must use the same depository, and it will be known as the ‘common depository’.

Using a depository also allows the bonds to be kept in jurisdictions other than those of the clearing systems (tax advantages). The use of a depository to hold the bonds is sometimes known as ‘immobilisation’.

```ad-question 
title: When can a global note not be placed with a common depository?
Some issuers will want their securities to be recognised by the European Central Bank as ‘eligible collateral’ for the euro central banking system (Eurosystem). From July 2006, securities are only eligible as Eurosystem collateral if their global form is held by the clearing system themselves and not at a common depository.
```

## Legal Advisers

Separately appointed by the issuer and the lead manager. If the issue involves a trust instrument, trustees also instruct solicitors. Roles:

- Preparing documentation
- Due diligence
- Producing a legal opinion for the transaction.

### Auditors

Auditors will be involved in the issue process whenever the issuer is an entity which produces accounts. The lead manager and its legal advisers will want to review the issuer’s accounts for at least the previous three years. If the issue is to be listed, audited accounts may need publishing/ incorporation by reference.

## Bond Issue Documentation

### Underwriting, Subscription and Distribution

1. mandate letter;  
2. initial syndicate communication (formerly known as ‘invitation telex’);  
3. allotment confirmation (formerly known as ‘allotment telex’);  
4. prospectus or other offering document;  
5. subscription agreement (or underwriting agreement);  
6. agreement among managers;  
7. auditor’s report and consent letter;  
8. auditor’s comfort letters;  
9. legal opinions.

### Bonds and Related Documents

1. Fiscal agency agreement (including paying agency agreement) (or trust deed);  
2. paying agency agreement (if no fiscal agent);  
3. temporary global note;  
4. permanent global note (or definitive form bond);  
5. deed of guarantee (if the issue is guaranteed and there is no trust deed);  
6. deed of covenant (if no trustee, and bonds are in permanent global form).

### Mandate Letter

This confirms the fundamental terms of the issue. Authorises the lead manager to announce the issue and invite other institutions to form a syndicate. Mandate letter prepared by the lead manager.

### Initial Syndicate Communication

- Document sent by the lead manager to prospective co-managers inviting them to participate in the issue by subscribing for bonds.
- If the issue is underwritten, co-managers will be requested to give an underwriting commitment.
- The requirement to send an initial syndicate communication, and its minimum content, are governed by ICMA rules.

### Allotment Confirmation

- Allocation (of the issue) is at the sole discretion of the lead manager.
	- In a traditional retention structure, the lead manager notifies co-managers of their allocation.
	- Where a ‘pot’ system is used, the co-managers reveal the identity of the investors they have identified to the lead manager, who then notifies them directly of their allocated amount.
- Investors pay purchase price to lead manager. Lead manager pays commission to comanagers for finding investors.
- Allotments must be made within 24 hours of the launch of an issue.

### Prospectus/ Listing Particulars

The prospectus is the document which provides detailed information about an issue for potential investors. If the issue is to be listed on the London Stock Exchange Professional Securities Market (‘PSM’) then this document is known as the ‘listing particulars’.

### Subscription/ Underwriting Agreement

```ad-defn
title: Subscription agreement 
The subscription agreement is a contract between the issuer, the lead manager and the co-managers which records the basis on which the issuer will sell, and the managers will buy, the bonds on issue.
```

Most London market bonds work on the basis that the syndicate will subscribe for all of the bonds between them, even if they cannot place them with investors. Under the terms of the subscription agreement, the liability of the syndicate members to the issuer of an issue is joint and several (key difference with a syndicated loan).

Whilst the managers will agree between themselves how many bonds they will each subscribe for (in the ‘agreement among managers’), the subscription agreement allows an issuer to require any one manager to subscribe for the entire bond issue if necessary.

Will also cover:

- CPs to the issue (e.g., legal opinions, auditors' consent, comfort letters)
- Pricing of the issue
- Managers fees and commissions
- Costs and expenses paid to the issuer
- Representations and warranties given to each manager
- Representation from managers that they will comply with applicable selling restrictions
- Fore majeure clause (allowing lead manager to terminate the syndicate's obligations).

### Agreement Among Managers

Agreement among managers is a contract between the lead manager and co-managers. Main purpose: to record the number of bonds which each member of the syndicate has agreed to take. Also covers payment and commission.

### Auditor's Report, Consent Letter, Comfort Letters

- Auditors required to sign off accounts
- Auditors asked to provide a consent letter consenting to the printing of their report and comfort letters to the managers confirming
	- No MAC
	- Unaudited financial information is correct.
- 2 comfort letters: one at signing and one at closing. These are legally binding on the auditors (similar to legal opinions).

### Legal Opinions

Required by the lead manager, co-managers and the trustee. Two required:

1. From the lead manager's solicitors wrt the binding nature of the documentation
2. From the issuer's solicitors confirming the due incorporation of the issuer, consents obtained, taxation, and enforceability of contractual documents against the issuer.

### Fiscal Agency Agreement

- Contract between the issuer, fiscal agent, and any other paying agents.
- Records the structure through which the bondholders will receive payment of coupon and principal.
- If the issue uses a trust arrangement then it will require a ‘principal paying agent’ (usually a bank); if a fiscal agent is used, it will perform the function of a principal paying agent.
- Further paying agents will need to be appointed if an issue requires payments to be made in jurisdictions outside that of the principal paying agent.

Will document:

- the procedure for authentication of the temporary global note and definitive bonds;
- the process necessary to exchange the temporary global note for definitive bonds;
- the issue of replacement bonds;
- the procedures for convening the bondholders’ meetings;
- fees and expenses of the paying agents.
- Full T&Cs of the bonds.

### Paying Agency Agreement

If a bond issue uses a trust arrangement, the trustee is not responsible for making any payments of coupon or principal. A ‘principal paying agent’ must be appointed under a separate agreement with the issuer. This is known as the ‘paying agency agreement’.

### Trust Deed

Details:

- Creation of trust
- Trust property
- Trust powers and duties
- Appointment and removal of trustees
- Requirements for bondholder meetings
- Monitoring of the issuer's financial position..

### Deed of Guarantee

Some corporate issuers may use a subsidiary to issue securities and raise finance. Often SPVs. Unlikely to be investment grade – so the parent company will guarantee the SPV's obligations under the bond.

The guarantee may be endorsed on the bond itself, or separately in a deed of guarantee.

### Deed of Covenant

If a note is in permanent global form (i.e., there are no definitive bonds) then the legal owner of the note is the common depositary bank since it is the bearer (holding the note on behalf of the clearing system).

The global note is exchangeable for definitives, but the issuer may be unwilling to comply in a non-payment situation – leaving the bondholders unable to enforce their claim.

- With a trust this isn't an issue: the trustee holds the issuer’s covenant to pay on trust for the bondholders.
- But if a fiscal agent is used, it is necessary to create a document which gives the bondholders a right to sue the issuer in accordance with their bond allocations shown in the clearing systems.
- That document is known as a deed of covenant: a promise to pay executed by the issuer in a deed poll, and which gives bondholders the right to claim against the issuer in accordance with their bond allocation shown on clearing system accounts.

## Bond T&Cs

### Comparison with a Facility Agreement

The terms in a bond are generally both fewer and shorter than the terms in most commercial facility agreements and very standardised.

Bondholder's concerns:

1. the issuer’s and the issue’s credit rating;
2. the amount of its investment;
3. the return it will receive on its investment;
4. when it is able to redeem its investment;
5. its rights on the issuer’s default ranking *pari passu* with any other holders of the same or similar debt instruments of the issuer.

Bondholder doesn't care about financial covenants unless the bond is a high yield bond. So no detailed reps and warranties!

### T&Cs Location

Govern how a bond instrument operates once it has been issued. Complete list found in lots of places:

1. in the temporary global note;
2. on the back of the definitive bearer (or registered) bond, or in the permanent global note;
3. as a schedule to the fiscal agency agreement (or trust deed);
4. sometimes in the paying agency agreement (if there is a trustee);
5. in the prospectus (or listing particulars).

Debt obligation is evident in the bond and is the property held on trust if a trustee is appointed.

### Specific T&Cs

- Preamble
	- May confirm the authorisation of the issue, lists parties, dates and contractual documents.
- Form, denomination and title.
	- Form: bearer, registered or global
	- Amounts in which bonds issued
	- Statement as to how title to the bonds will pass.
- Status
	- Specifies characteristic of the debt obligation and its ranking among other debt obligations
	- Bonds usually unsecured.
- Negative pledge
	- Usually less onerous than commercial banking loan
	- Ensures the issuer will not issue debt securities ranking higher than the current issue, unless bondholders of the current issue receive identical rights.
- Coupon
	- If fixed, payable annually in arrear
	- If floating, calculated and paid as stipulated in the payment clause.
	- The coupon payment dates will usually be the same dates in the appropriate months depending on the commencement date of the issue itself (so long as business days)
	- Fixed rate bonds issued after 1 January 1999 usually use the ‘Actual/Actual’ convention. Different interpretations of this – the most common is the ICMA method: actual days elapsed over the product of the number of days in a coupon period and the number of coupon periods.
	- For floating rate notes (and syndicated loans, for most currencies other than sterling), the ‘Actual/360’ or ‘365/360’ basis is usually used.
	- This applies the ‘annual’ rate (x%) to the principal sum as if it were x% per 360 days.
- Payments
	- Definitive bearer bond: surrender of the bond for payment of principal; surrender of relevant coupon for interest. Effected through paying agents who are the agents of the issuer (recall facility agreements – agents of lenders).
	- Most bonds held in clearing systems so payments made from paying agents directly to clearing systems which credit money accordingly.
- Redemption and purchase
	- Bond can be redeemed:
		- On maturity, at par
		- For tax reasons (tax redemption clause – redemption of the entire issue if as a result of a change in tax laws, issuer is required to gross of payments of interest or capital).
		- Repurchase – nothing to stop an issuer purchasing its own bonds on the secondary market. If listed, LRs require issuer to notify all bondholders of intentions. Purchases by tender offer must be made to all bondholders.
- Taxation
	- An issuer will be required to gross up payments to investors in very limited circumstances, since the issuer has little control over the bondholder’s identity and tax domicile.
	- Any grossing-up obligation is usually restricted to taxes imposed by the issuer’s own jurisdiction and would benefit only ‘non-domestic’ investors.
- Events of default
	- Less onerous than a facility agreement.
	- Default for non-payment will have a (typically) 14-day grace period.
- Prescription
	- Period for which a bondholder must claim principal and coupon (usually 10 years and 5 years respectively) from the due date for payment. At the end of the prescription period, the debt is actually extinguished not just action barred.
- Bond/ coupon replacement
	- Provision deals with lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed bonds.
	- The condition for replacement of bonds and coupons therefore provides that the bondholder claiming a replacement must indemnify the issuer in respect of any payments the issuer has to make on the original bond or coupon and pay all expenses of the issuer in making such a replacement.
- Meetings of bondholders
	- The procedure for convening bondholders’ meetings and the conducting of business thereat is provided for in the fiscal agency agreement (or trust deed).
	- Trustee convenes meetings (own initiative of at request of 10% of bondholders)
	- Usually only convened if there is a problem/ modifications of the T&Cs are required.
	- Conditions governing meetings usually in standard form.
	- Strict quorum requirements.
	- Under English law, there are no specific statutory requirements as to when a majority can bind a minority of bondholders. However, in order to protect the minority, English euromarket practice dictates that the majority of bondholders required to pass an extraordinary resolution is 75%.
- Notices
	- However, the identity of bond investors will not be known, and therefore notice can be given only by one or more of an RIS, the FCA or a national newspaper.
	- LSE has its own notification requirements (must also notify the exchange when notifying bond holders).
	- Notices of meetings for holders of London listed debt securities in bearer form must usually be placed in a leading national newspaper circulating in the UK, and a copy of the notice must be sent to the Company Announcements Office of the London Stock Exchange.
- Further issues
	- Issuer permitted to issue further bonds with same T&Cs as the ones in issue.
	- Allowed without the consent of the bondholders.
- Governing law and jurisdiction
	- Boiler plate clauses
	- Usually English law and English courts.
