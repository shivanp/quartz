# Prospectus & Listing

International bonds are usually listed:

- Tax efficiency
- Investor demand

London-based bond listed in either London, Ireland or Luxembourg.

## London Listing

Listing a bond in London required:

1. Admission to the Official List; and
2. Admission to trading on either a regulated or unregulated market.

### Official List Admission

Effectively = satisfying legal requirements.

The new regime (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129) is commonly referred to as the Prospectus Regulation or ‘PD3’ and replaced the previous EU prospectus regime in full.

The UK ‘onshored’ the Prospectus Regulation, incorporating its provisions into English law, by way of the Prospectus (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/1234), the Official Listing of Securities, Prospectus and Transparency (Amendment etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/707) and the Financial Services (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/628).

FCA is the competent authority to implement UK Listing Rules, but delegates this task to a division – the UK Listing Authority (UKLA).

The UKLA’s implementation of the Listing Rules takes the form of the Listing Rules (LR), Prospectus Regulation Rules (PRR) sourcebook and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) sourcebook in the FCA Handbook.

### Admission to Trading

Two markets:

- The London Stock Exchange’s ‘Main Market’
	- EEA ‘regulated market’, for the purposes of many EU Directives and Regulations.
	- Requires publication of a UKLA-approved disclosure document known as a ‘prospectus’ which complies with the Prospectus Regulation.
- The Professional Securities Market (PSM) is an ‘unregulated market’.
	- Slightly more relaxed regime than the Main Market.
	- Requires publication of a UKLA-approved disclosure document known as ‘listing particulars’ rather than a prospectus.
	- As the PSM is regulated by the stock exchange, the UK Prospectus Regulation does **not** apply to securities listed on this market.

Bonds may also be admitted to trading on the International Securities Market (ISM). The disclosure rules were created by the London Stock Exchange (rather than the UKLA), and the London Stock Exchange (rather than the UKLA) reviews the admission particulars. There is no listing – but still a tax advantage. Need to produce “admission particulars”, rather than listing particulars or a prospectus.

The ISM was introduced 5 years ago to try to stop people listing bonds in Ireland and Luxembourg.

## Approved Prospectus

```ad-tip
A prospectus approved by the UKLA is essentially required (as a prerequisite) if a bond issue is to be offered to the public or admitted to trading on the Main Market.
```

Following the UK’s exit from the EU, passporting (or “mutual recognition”) of prospectuses is no longer possible.

Any EU issuer that wishes to offer to the public or admit to trading on the Main Market any securities must now secure approval of their prospectus from the FCA, in accordance with UK Prospectus, even if approval has already been secured from an EU member state regulator.

### Exempt Bonds

Certain exempt securities are listed in the Prospectus Regulation, the Prospectus Regulation Rules (PRR) sourcebook and also in Sch 11A to the FSMA 2000. Mostly not relevant for a corporate offer.

### Exempt Offers

Even if the bond is offered to the public, in the UK there are exemptions from producing an approved prospectus provided that the bond is not admitted to trading on a regulated market (e.g., if offered on the PSM). Exemptions found in the Prospectus Regulation at Article 1.4 and are referenced in s 86 of the FSMA 2000 and in PRR 1.2.3. The exemptions focus on offers which are not targeting the ‘general public’.

This includes:

- An offer which is made to or directed at ‘qualified investors’
- An offer which is made to or directed at fewer than 150 persons (other than ‘qualified investors’) per EEA State;
- The minimum consideration which may be paid by any person pursuant to the securities offer is €100,000 (or equivalent);
- Where the securities have a minimum denomination of €100,000 (or equivalent), often referred to as a ‘wholesale’ offer;
- Where the total consideration for the securities is less than €8 million. This exemption derives from Article 3.2 of the Prospectus Regulation.

## Prospectus Contents

### Authority

UKLA has authority to dictate listing particulars from s 79 FSMA 2000 $\rightarrow$ Listing Rules can require that securities may not be admitted to the official list unless:

1. listing particulars have been submitted to, and approved by, the competent authority and published, or
2. in such cases as may be specified by listing rules, such document … as may be so specified has been published.

### General Content

Prospectus Regulation Rule (PRR) 2.1.1 replicates the general content requirements contained in Article 6(1) of the Prospectus Regulation on the ‘necessary information’ to be contained in the prospectus: information which is material to an investor for making an informed assessment of:

1. the assets and liabilities, profits and losses, financial position and prospects of the issuer and of any guarantor;
2. the rights attaching to the securities; and
3. the reasons for the issuance and its impact on the issuer.

The information may vary depending on:

- The nature of the issuer.
- The type of securities.
- The circumstances of the issuer.
- In respect of non-equity securities, whether or not the securities have a denomination per unit of at least EUR100,000 or are to be traded only on a regulated market, or specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors have access for the purpose of trading those securities.

```ad-tip
The level of detail required in a prospectus will depend on whether it is a ‘retail’ (ie ‘nonexempt’) or ‘wholesale’ (ie ‘exempt’) offer. The ‘wholesale’ regime requires less detailed disclosure, but applies only if the securities are denominated at or above €100,000.
```

### Prospectus Format

Format outlined at PRR 2.2. For a stand-alone bond issue, can either have a single document or 3 separate documents;

1. Registration document – information relating to the seller
2. Securities note – information relating to the bonds.
3. Summary – retail only (max. 7 sides A4).

Registration document is valid for 12 months so can be re-used for multiple issues in that period. But most stand-alone issues just use a single document.

Art 8 Prospectus Regulation (PRR 2.2.3) allows the issuer of a debt programme (e.g., an MTN programme) to use a ‘base prospectus’ (containing the main information on issuer and programme) and a ‘final terms’ document (which contains information on each particular securities issue under the programme).

### Listing Particulars

Listing particulars are required when a bond is

- Admitted to trading on PSM
- Admitted to trading on LSE but does not require a prospectus under Prospectus Regulation.

### Responsibility for Information

s 84(1)(d) of the FSMA 2000 allows the PRR to specify who is responsible for a prospectus, and for a bond PRR 5.3.5 specifies that this includes:

1. the issuer;
2. anyone who accepts (and the prospectus states as accepting) responsibility;
3. the offeror (if this is not the issuer);
4. the person requesting admission to trading (if this is not the issuer);
5. any guarantor (in relation to information on them or the guarantee); and
6. anyone else who has authorised the contents of the prospectus.

For a bond, the issuer's directors are not required to take responsibility for the prospectus. PR 2.3: each of those responsible must make a declaration in the prospectus that;

> [ ] accepts responsibility for the information contained in this document. To the best of their knowledge and belief the information contained in this document is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.

### Key Issuer Information

| Category  | Minimum denomination | Relevant disclosure annexes |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Wholesale | $\geq 100,000$ EUR   | 7, 15                       |
| Retail    | $< 100,000$ EUR      | 6, 14                            |

The FCA operates a "Wholesale Debt Approach" to reviewing prospectuses and listing particulars for wholesale debt issues. This approach generally means a faster review process with fewer rounds of comments than for higher-risk issues such as retail issues or complex debt issues.

Annexes are of Commission Delegated Regulation 2019/980.

The minimum disclosure requirements for information relating to the issuer under the more onerous ‘retail’ regime include the following:

- Persons responsible
- Financial information
	- Audited accounts for 2 years
	- IFRS/ GAAP accounting
- Risk factors
	- Grouped into categories; most material first
- Information about the issuer
	- Name, registration number, registered office etc.
	- Recent events particular to the issuer which are to a material extent relevant to the evaluation of the issuer's solvency.
- Business overview
	- Issuer's activities, new products and markets
	- Statement of no material adverse change in the prospects of the issuer since last accounts.
- Admin, management, supervisory bodies, (controlling) shareholders
- Material contracts and displaying documents
	- The prospectus must summarise any material contracts ‘not entered into in the ordinary course of the issuer’s business’ which could result in any member of the group being under an obligation or entitlement that is material to the issuer’s obligations under the securities.
	- Hyperlinks to certain ‘display documents’ (e.g. the memorandum and articles, reports, valuations, etc) which may be inspected.

### Bond Information

Minimum disclosure requirements for information relating to the bonds:

- Use of proceeds
- Information about the securities
	- type (e.g., registered or bearer), currency, ranking, coupon, maturity and governing law.
	- T&Cs of the offer
- Repeated information
	- Under Article 19 of the Prospectus Regulation, an issuer may incorporate certain information by reference into the prospectus.
	- The summary document must not incorporate information by reference.

## General Duty of Disclosure

Art 6 Prospectus Regulation: prospectus must contain the necessary information which is material to an investor for making an informed assessment of:

1. the assets and liabilities, profits and losses, financial position and prospects of the issuer and of any guarantor;
2. the rights attaching to the securities; and
3. the reasons for the issuance and its impact on the issuer.

Article 6 also states that in determining what information is required to comply with this obligation, account must be taken of ‘the type of securities and their issuer’.

Similar disclosure obligation: s 80 FSMA 2000 – must consider;

1. the nature of the persons who are likely to consider acquiring the securities;
2. the fact that certain matters may reasonably be expected to be within the knowledge of professional advisers of any kind which those persons may reasonably be expected to consult; and
3. any information available to investors or their professional advisers by virtue of requirements imposed by listing rules, by any other legislation or by a recognised investment exchange.

Prospectus Regulations require all retail prospectuses to be drafted in plain language, with additional descriptive text on how to navigate the prospectus.

## Omission of Information

The requirements for bonds are, however, generally less wide-ranging than for equity issues, reflecting the more sophisticated investor base of the former.

Rules list limited circumstances in which the UKLA can authorise the omission of information.

Article 18 of the Prospectus Regulation (PRR 2.8), an exemption from the duty to disclose (whether that duty arises under the Rules, s 87A or s 80) may be granted if:

1. disclosure would be contrary to the public interest;
2. disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the issuer of the securities ; or
3. the information is of minor importance only and not such as to influence the assessment of the assets and liabilities, financial position, profits and losses and prospects of the issuer.

## Liability for Prospectus and Listing Particulars

Misstatements and omissions can give rise to civil/ criminal liability.

### Civil Liability

#### FSMA 2000

s 90 FSMA 2000 applies to both a prospectus and any supplementary prospectus.

Anyone responsible for those documents is liable to compensate any person who acquires any of the securities and suffers loss in respect of them ‘as a result of any untrue or misleading statement in the [prospectus] or any omission from them of any matter required to be included’ under the general disclosure obligation.

- Section concerned with a loss suffered by a person who has acquired any of the securities.
	- May include subsequent purchasers on a secondary market.
- Person concerned must establish that they suffered loss in respect of the securities as a result of the offending statement/ omission.
	- Condition satisfied if the price paid for the securities is higher than it would be but for the error/ omission.
	- Not necessary to have reliance.

##### Defences

Sch 10 FSMA 2000 defences include:

1. That at the time the prospectus was submitted to the UKLA they reasonably believed, having made such enquiries (if any) as were reasonable, that the statement was true and not misleading, or that the matter the omission of which caused the loss was properly omitted. Additionally, must establish one of the following:
	1. Belief continued until the time the securities were acquired
	2. Acquired before reasonably practical to bring a correction to the attention of persons likely to acquire the securities
	3. Before the securities were acquired, they had taken all such steps as reasonable for them to have taken to ensure a correction was brought to the attention of those persons.
	4. Continued in that belief until after the commencement of dealings in the securities following listing.
2. Where the alleged loss arises as a result of an expert’s statement, and that the person defending the claim reasonably believed that the expert was competent to make or authorise the statement in the prospectus and had consented to its inclusion in the form and context in which it was included.
	1. Must also establish one of (1)-(4) above.
3. Before the securities were acquired they had published a correction ‘in a manner calculated to bring it to the attention of persons likely to acquire the securities’, or, at the very least, that they had taken all such steps as were reasonable for them to secure such publication, which they reasonably believed had taken place before the acquisition.
4. That the loss arose from an official statement or one contained in a public official document, which had been accurately and fairly reproduced in the prospectus.
5. That the investor knew that the statement was false or misleading, or knew the matter which had been omitted.
6. Where the potential liability arose from a failure to provide a supplementary prospectus, and that they reasonably believed that the change or new matter did not warrant them.

#### Negligent Misstatement

[[Hedley Byrne v Heller [1964] AC 465]]!! Misstatements in a prospectus may give rise to liability in tort.

Liability arises if a person suffers loss having relied upon a misstatement and the person who made the misstatement owed a duty of care to the one suffering loss on the faith of it.

Applying the principle to misstatements in a prospectus, it is thought that those assuming responsibility for the prospectus owe a duty of care to those applying for securities in the company on the marketing of those securities, but not to subsequent trading on the secondary market (see [[Caparo Industries v Dickman [1990] 1 All ER 568]]). The inability of a subsequent purchaser to bring a claim for negligent misstatement contrasts with the position in relation to liability under the FSMA 2000; so too does the requirement that the claimant must have relied on the misstatement to their detriment.

#### Misrepresentation Act 1967

A person may be able to rescind the contract for the acquisition and/or claim damages if they acted upon an incorrect/ misleading statement in the prospectus/ an omission from it. Under the 1967 Act, a claim for damages may be made only against the other party to the contract.

#### Contract

If an investor subscribes for and receives securities at the time of their issue, they will have entered into a contract and the prospectus will form part of that contract because of the representations and warranties in the subscription agreement.

If the prospectus is wrong/ misleading, the investor may be entitled to rescind the contract and/ or sue the other contracting party for damages.

- As part of the subscription arrangements, the syndicate of managers generally obtain a number of warranties + indemnities from the issuer.
- If an investor, who does not have the benefit of those warranties, brings a claim against a member of the syndicate, that syndicate member may seek recompense from the issuer under the terms of the warranties and indemnities.

### Criminal Liability

#### FSA 2012 Ss 89 & 90

- s 89 – misleading statements
	- Criminal offence for any person to make a statement which he knows to be false or misleading in a material respect, to conceal dishonestly any material facts or recklessly make a statement which is misleading.
- s 90 – misleading impressions.
	- Catches anything any person does to create a false or misleading impression as to the market in, or price or sale of the shares, if he does so deliberately to induce investors to buy investments, sell them, underwrite them or refrain from so doing or, while knowing the impression to be false or misleading makes a gain or causes a loss.

#### Other Provisions

Liability may also arise under Theft Act/ Fraud Act.

## Golden Belt Case

[[Golden Belt 1 Sukuk Company v BNP Paribas and others [2017] EWHC 3182 (Comm)]] involved Sharia-compliant fixed income capital markets instruments known as ‘sukuk’, which are very similar to bonds.

The court held that an ‘arranging’ bank owed a duty to investors (i.e., holders of sukuk certificates) to exercise reasonable care to ensure the promissory note was properly executed.

## Prospectus Regulation

### Securities

For the purposes of the _[UK Prospectus Regulation](https://uk.westlaw.com/w-028-7820?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=20e13a611e13444ebce3d0cd9aea3960)_, "securities" means transferable securities as defined in Article 2(1)(24) of the markets in financial instruments regulation, other than money market instruments as defined in Article 2(1)(25A) of that regulation that have a maturity of less than 12 months (_Article 2(a)_).

Article 2(1)(24) of _[UK MiFIR](https://uk.westlaw.com/w-028-5575?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=20e13a611e13444ebce3d0cd9aea3960)_ defines “transferable securities” as those classes of securities which are negotiable on the capital market.
