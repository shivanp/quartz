## Mandate

= instructing an investment bank to lead-manage the issue.

Once appointed, the lead manager advises on the most appropriate structure for an issue and the best market. Issuer and lead manager must agree:

- Marketing strategy
- Whether to list
- Identities of fiscal agent/ trustee and paying agents
- Fee structure

Recorded in mandate letter/ term sheet, drafted by the lead manager.

## Due Diligence

Bond issues require due diligence in which the lead manager verifies information needed for the issue. As a general rule, the due diligence process for an issue of equity linked securities will be more ‘in depth’ than for a straight debt issue, since investors in the former may become shareholders in the issuer (different risk).

The lead manager usually conducts the due diligence meeting by asking detailed questions about the other parties to obtain sufficient information to proceed with the issue/ prepare the prospectus. Alternative: draft lots of questions.

Helps to provide material for the prospectus. Obtaining the comfort letters in agreed form from the issuer’s auditors is also part of the due diligence process

## Documentation

If the bond issue is to be listed, a draft of the prospectus or listing particulars must be sent to the appropriate listing authority. The UKLA usually requires a period of at least 10 working days in which to review a prospectus prior to its intended publication (or 20 working days if the issuer has not previously admitted securities to trading or made a public offer).

- Prospectus.
- Subscription agreement.
- Agreement among managers.
- Fiscal agency agreement and deed of covenant.*
- Trust deed and paying agency agreement.*
- Global note.
- Legal opinion.
- Signing and closing memorandum.

## Marketing

Lead manager helps the issuer's directors in roadshows to potential investors. Check roadshow material to ensure it complies with ss 21 and 25 of the FSMA 2000.

```ad-note
Sections 21–25 of the FSMA 2000 make it an offence for any person other than an ‘authorised person’ (ie, authorised to carry on regulated activity under the FSMA 2000) to ‘in the course of business, communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity’ (or to cause the same) in the UK, unless its contents have been approved by an authorised person (or an exemption applies).
```

## Launch and Syndication

Launch date confirmed by formal public announcement. Launch must await completion of due diligence/ marketing. On launch, the issue is announced to the market and the lead manager sends an initial syndicate communication to financial institutions chosen to be invited into the syndicate. Invitation shows the price of the bonds and fees/ commissions to syndicate bank. Co-managers required to respond to the invitation within 24 hours of receipt. Acceptance does not constitute a binding contract to subscribe: that is the purpose of the subscription agreement – moral obligation.

The invitation telex usually includes the following:

- **Terms.** Proposed terms of the bond issue.
- **Selling restrictions.** Any relevant selling restrictions that apply to the issue.
- **Fees.** The fees of the managers.
- **Agreement among managers.** Which version of the two industry-standard agreements among managers is to be used.

Once all the co-managers have responded, the lead manager will know the level of interest in the issue, and can notify each co-manager of the number of bonds it is expected to take at issue by way of a confirmation of allotment. Once the confirmation of allotment has been sent, the draft subscription agreement is sent to each co-manager.

## Listing

A listed bond is one which is formally quoted, listed or capable of being traded on a recognised stock exchange.

Reasons:

- To demonstrate that a bond has satisfied the requirements of the exchange - attaining listed status makes a bond more marketable.
- Some entities are precluded from investing in securities which are not listed.
- One specific advantage of obtaining a London listing of bonds is the ‘quoted bond exemption’ from UK withholding tax. This exemption allows a UK issuer to pay gross interest on both bearer and registered bonds.

Disadvantages:

- Cost
	- Listing authorities charge a fee
	- Lead manager fees and legal fees higher
- Timing
	- Longer timetable UKLA needs time to review documentation & more DD

### Listing Requirements

See Listing Rule 2. The Stock Exchange reserves the right to impose any special condition it considers appropriate in the interests of protecting investors. These include:

- Status
	- Issuer duly incorporated and operating in conformity with constitution.
- Securities
	- Conditions:
		- Conform to law of issuer's place of incorporation, etc.
		- Freely transferrable
		- Expected aggregate market value of at least £200,000
		- Entire class of a security must be listed
		- Convertible securities must convert into securities themselves listed.

### Application Procedure

LR 3, LR 17, PRR 3.

#### 10 Clear Business Day Documents

Issuers (through their sponsor) must submit two copies of specified documents to the UKLA at least 10 clear business days prior to their intended publication (see PRR 3.1.6).

For a bond issue, these documents are:

- Requisite application form
- Prospectus (annotated to indicate compliance)
- 2 letters (non-applicable letter and omission of information letter) explaining why some information does not appear).

#### Marked-up Documents

Any 10-day documents which the UKLA amends (or which are altered after submission to the UKLA) must be re-submitted with the changes marked up.

#### 48-hour Documents

Listing Rule 3.4.4 requires the following documents, in final form, to be submitted at least two business days prior to the consideration of the listing application:

1. a complete application for admission of the securities, and
2. either:
	1. the approved prospectus or listing particulars; or
	2. a copy of a prospectus approved by another Member State (under the ‘passporting’ regime).

#### Listing Charge

On the day of consideration of the listing application, the issuer must pay the appropriate listing fee (Listing Rule 3.2.2).

There are also continuing obligations.

## Signing

Usually within 2 weeks of the issue being launched. Lead manager and solicitors must be sure that aspects of the issue process have been completed before signing.

Lead manager's solicitors should ensure:

- Prospectus is in agreed form
- Other contractual documents completed
- Resolutions necesssary to authorise issue executed
- Common depository appointed.

## Closing

Takes place ~1 week after signing. Issuer receives funds and bonds come into being. Lead manager's solicitors will produce an agenda to ensure necessary matters completed.

### Documentary Procedures

Lead manager's solicitor to complete before closing;

- Admission to listing
- CPs to subscription agreement satisfied
- Auditors' closing comfort letter and issuer's closing certificate
- Legal opinions

By the end of completion, execute:

- Trust deed
- Fiscal agency agreement/ paying agency agreement
- Auditors' closing comfort letter
- Legal opinions
- Issuer's closing certificate
- Payment instructions from lead manager
- Temporary global note
- Permanent global note, if any
- Receipts between issuer and lead manager.

Temporary global note authenticated by the fiscal agent to give it legal effect and delivered to the depository for safe-keeping.

After closing, any documents still to be lodged with UKLA must be sent to the listing agent.

### Payment Procedures

Closing mechanics/ payment against delivery procedures involved in most transactions.

#### Prior to Closing

The lead manager will have notified the clearing system of the names and amounts of bonds to be allotted to the account of each syndicate member. Each syndicate member will also give payment instructions to the clearing system to the effect that its cash account is to be debited.

The instructions are phrased so that the debit will be made only if the syndicate member is credited with the requisite number of bonds in its securities account (payment against delivery).

The lead manager will also instruct the clearing system to debit its new issues account with the total amount of the issue to be paid to the account of the common depository.

#### At Closing

The lead manager will authorise release of its payment instruction to the depository to transfer the money (already placed with the depository) representing the issue amount to the issuer. The depository will transfer the money to the issuer's bank account upon receiving the temporary global note.

The closing is now complete: the issuer has its funds and the depository holds the temporary global note on behalf of the clearing system. The clearing system will have credited the securities accounts of each syndicate member.

### Payment Against Delivery
