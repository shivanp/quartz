# International Capital Markets

## What is a Capital Market

- Colloquially, capital markets are used to refer to debt and equity securities only.
- Market – the borrowing requirements of potential issuers and funds available from investors
- Size of market – funds available and tradability of securities

### Debt Securities Vs Loan Facilities

- In capital markets, the borrower issues a document evidencing the debt obligation in return for money received from lenders. The borrower is called the issuer.
- Wide variety of institutions and individuals “lend” by purchasing securities on the capital markets. Lenders known as investors.
- High liquidity, potentially low interest rates.
- Most asset sales (of loan agreements) have a limited market, whereas capital markets can easily trade debt.
- Size and maturities of debt can be more varied
- Debt securities can be more varied than for commercial loans
- Listed bond issue involves publicity; loan agreement can be confidential.
- Undertakings and events of default in capital markets, less onerous and restrictive than facility agreement. Note there is a trustee with a basic role of overseeing standard undertakings.

## Domestic and Euromarkets

> [!defn] Domestic market
> A market in a currency in its currency of origin. 

> [!defn] Euromarkets
> "Euro" means currency held outside the currency's country of origin. Euromarkets are international markets. 

- Eurocurrency market means the FX market.
- Eurosecurities are international securities (e.g., dollar denominated bond issued by Tesco, or sterling bond issued by Tesco intended to raise sterling from overseas investors).

### Origins of Euromarkets

- US govt putting strict controls on interest rates and high taxes on non-nationals issuing bonds in the USA in 60s and 70s.
- So companies issued dollar denominated bonds outside US to avoid the tax.

### Foreign Securities

Eurocurrency instrument taps into money held outside its country of origin (i.e., the country of origin of the currency). So a dollar denominated bond issued anywhere except US is a eurocurrency instrument.

However, if a non-British company issues a sterling instrument (to ‘domestic’ investors) in the UK, this will raise currency in its country of origin, and so it is not a ‘euro’ issue but rather a ‘foreign’ issue. Colloquially, “bulldog”, “Yankee”, “samurai”.

## Debt and Equity Securities

### Equity Securities

- Essentially a non-returnable investment
- An investor has no absolute right to receive a return on its investment
- Investor will rank behind all other creditors of the company in the event of winding up.
- Usually voting rights.

### Debt Securities

- Maturity date on which the issuer must redeem the security by repaying the investor
- Under security T&Cs, an investor will have the right to receive a regular return on its investment, or the investment may be issued at a discount to its face value on redemption.
- May be secured, but unlikely
- Investor does not generally take any equity in the issuer or have any rights over the issuer (other than to call an event of default if not paid/ basic undertakings breached).

## Bonds and Notes

> [!defn]
> Certificate of debt under which the issuer obligates itself to pay the principal to the bondholder on a specified date.

Characteristics:

- Debt obligation made by way of a transferable instrument
- Sold to a wide number of investors through a syndicate
- Marketable instrument
- May or may not be listed
- Interest bearing/ issued at a discount to face value at redemption

> [!note] Terminology
> Note used to be reserved for securities with a short maturity/ floating rate coupon and bond for everything else. Now terms used interchangeably. 
> 
> Refer to:
> - ‘floating rate notes’, not ‘floating rate bonds’;
> - a ‘global note’, rather than a ‘global bond’;
> - securities issued under a programme as ‘notes’, not ‘bonds’;
> - securities issued under a securitisation as ‘notes’, not ‘bonds’.
> 
> If in doubt, use the term ‘note’ rather than ‘bond’.

### Fixed Rate Bonds

- Rate of interest yielded fixed at the time of issue and does not change during the life of the bond.
- Interest is usually payable annually semi-annually in arrears.
- Interest rate fixed at issue will depend on:
	- Market conditions
	- Issuer's credit rating
	- Length of maturity of the bond

### Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)

Pay interest which fluctuates according to a benchmark (LIBOR, now typically SONIA) - e.g., SONIA + 0.5%. Raate recalculated each time interest is paid. Interest usually paid at least quarterly.

Appealing to financial instutitions which lend at a floating rate and want to attain matched funding.

#### Reverse FRNs

Interest payable on bond rises/ falls in the opposite direction to a benchmark level.

- Used to speculate on general interest rates
- Used to hedge currency exposure.

### Variable Rate Bonds

Bond with a rate of interest which varies throughout the term of the bond, but the variation is restricted/ designated to alter in accordance with a schedule.

#### Step-up/ Step-down Bonds

In a ‘step-up’ bond, the initial fixed interest rate moves up to another (pre-determined) fixed rate after a given time.

#### Collars

A bond which is subject to a ‘collar’ is similar to an FRN in that its rate of interest will vary in accordance with a benchmark rate (e.g., SONIA or LIBOR); however, the rate of interest payable is subject to an upper and a lower limit. These limits are known as the ‘cap’ and ‘floor’ respectively.

### Zero Coupon Bonds

Do not pay any interest. Bond issued at a discount. Return achieved on maturity. Bond appreciates as the date of maturity becomes closer.

> [!tip]
> As interest rates fall, the price of a zero coupon bond already in issue will rise since the yield it offers can be lower but still compete with equivalent interest-bearing bonds. 

Zero coupon bonds advantage: investor taxed on capital gain rather than income.

### Equity Linked Bonds

Some bonds are linked to the equity (share capital) of the issuer. provide an investor with the opportunity to obtain some form of equity interest in the issuer. 3 main types:

1. Convertible bonds
2. Bonds with warrants; and
3. Exchangeable bonds.

#### Convertible Bonds

Provide the bondholder with the option to convert the bond into shares in the issuer at some stage after issue. The option to convert usually exists throughout the life of the bond.

Once a bondholder converts, the issuer will create new shares to be given in exchange for the bond, which is then redeemed in consideration for the issue of shares.

> [!action]
> - The directors should ensure there are no restrictions on allotment in the articles.
> - New shares are effectively issued for cash consideration so existing shareholders may have pre-emption rights to disapply. 

A convertible bond will also specify the ‘conversion price’. This is the price at which the shares a bondholder receives in exchange for its bond will be valued upon conversion.

The conversion price of the shares will invariably be higher than their market value at the time the convertible bond is issued. Difference: “conversion premium”".

Attraction to investors: potential high return with limited risk. If the issuer performs well, the bondholder can take advantage of any resultant rise in its share price by exercising conversion rights selling shares received on conversion.

Issuer attraction:

- Interest rate offered on a convertible bond will be less than an equivalent non-convertible bond.
- Equity financing can be deferred if the issuer feels the share price is currently undervalued.

> [!note] CoCo bonds
> Convertible capital bonds (also known as ‘CoCo bonds’) are a type of convertible bond that converts into equity at the happening of a defined event as opposed to the issuer’s or investor’s option. The trigger point is typically related to a bank’s regulatory position.

#### Bonds with Warrants (options)

Bonds issued as 2 securities:

- Interest-bearing security; and
- An option to purchase shares in the issuer which can be exercised by the bondholder.

The bond pays a fixed rate of interest and has a specified maturity and will always remain a debt obligation regardless of whether the warrants are exercised. Provide the bondholder with a right to buy shares at a pre-determined price – either within a specified time period (European option) or at any time (American option).

The options provide an incentive to purchase the bond and allow the issuer to have a lower coupon. Option detachable and can be traded separately.

#### Exchangeable Bonds

The shares for which the bond can be exchanged are not shares in the issuer but shares in a related company (parent/ subsidiary). Rare.

## Other Debt Securities

### Medium Term Notes (MTNs)

Usually issued in several series through a programme. Essentially, an MTN programme involves the issuer and an arranger agreeing a set of legal documentation under which the issuer can issue notes of varying currencies and maturities.

The MTN programme may provide that the notes are issued in either bearer or registered form; and if in bearer form, they may be held as global notes or in definitive form.

The documentation specifies the T&Cs of the series of notes and provides an information memorandum to be used for selling the notes to investors (to be updated periodically). The programme will also appoint a number of ‘dealers’, one of whom (although not always the same one) acts as a lead manager to each separate issue of notes.

The advantage of an MTN programme is that it allows an issuer to issue a wide variety of notes at very short notice (since the majority of the necessary documentation is already in place).

### Commercial Paper

Type of security providing issuers with short-term borrowing in capital markets. Bank sets up programme for a company. Dealers appointed who are responsible for finding buyers of the commercial paper in return for commission. Not usually underwritten, and the issuer is not under any obligation to issue.

Usually unsecured and sold at a discount rather than being interest bearing. Almost always in global form. Typical maturity of 1-2 months.

Whilst the programme specifies a maximum amount of paper which may be issued, it is a ‘rolling’ maximum limiting the amount which can be outstanding at any one time.

### Certificates of Deposit

Certificates (i.e., receipts) issued by a bank or building society in return for a deposit of money made with them in the form of a loan. Negotiable instruments issued in bearer form.

CDs issued and payable in the UK (known as ‘London CDs’) usually have a maturity of no more than five years and may bear interest (which is more common), or be issued at a discount.

The advantage to a lender of investing spare cash in a CD is that it receives a very good rate of interest – because the loan not repayable until the CD matures – but can recover capital at any time by selling the CD in the market. CDs are unsecured. If trading in the London market, must follow British Bankers' Association guidelines.

### Bills of Exchange

Originally an instrument recognising a trade debt. A seller draws up a document under which the buyer promises to pay for them after a specific period (e.g., 3 months). Credit called a "trade bill of exchange". Can be traded. Some bills of exchange will have payment of the amount due under them guaranteed (or ‘accepted’) by a bank. These are known as ‘bank bills’ or ‘accepted bills’. Because they carry less risk of non-repayment, accepted bills will be sold at a higher price (i.e., less discount).

### Treasury Bills

Used by governments for short term borrowing to balance cash flows. No coupon; sold at a discount.

## Primary and Secondary Markets

When a security is issued it is offered on the "primary market". Further trading = secondary market. An instrument with an established secondary market is usually known as a ‘marketable instrument’. Marketability is v important.

## Clearing Systems

Originally all eurobond took the form of paper certificates. Represented a debt to be paid by the issuer to whoever possessed the bond at maturity. These definitive ‘bearer bonds’ are difficult to trade rapidly in large numbers and are vulnerable to theft or loss.

‘Clearing systems’ were developed which allowed the bonds to be left safely in a vault and for trading to take place through accounts. There are a number of clearing systems worldwide which deal with trading bearer (and other) securities. However, in the international eurosecurities markets, there are two systems of paramount importance: the Euroclear system and the Clearstream Service (which is part of the Deutsche Börse Group), commonly referred to as ‘Euroclear’ and ‘Clearstream’.

### Operation of Clearing Systems

Euroclear & Clearstream accept most common forms of security actively traded on capital markets.

The primary purpose of a clearing system is to avoid the physical handling of bearer instruments on issue and on subsequent trading. Therefore, the actual bond certificates (which may be in definitive bearer form or global form) are invariably passed on to a bank known as a ‘depositary’ for safekeeping, and the clearing system works through a series of ‘book entries’ (akin to depositing cash with your bank and debiting your account to pay debts rather than withdrawing cash).

To participate, an investor will have 2 accounts with the system:

1. Securities clearance account to and from which securities are credited.
2. Cash account through which all payments from sale and purchase of securities must pass.

Each issue of securities is allocated a unique code number, known as its ISIN (International Securities Identification Number), from which is derived the ‘Common Code’. The Common Code is used as a label to identify the particular issue each time the clearing system is instructed to deal in securities.

If a bondholder wants to sell some bonds on the secondary market, it instructs the clearer, which reduces the seller’s securities clearance account by the requisite number of securities and credits them to the securities clearance account of the purchaser. Simultaneously, the cash account of the purchaser is debited, and the cash account of the seller credited.

On the closing date of a new issue, the requisite number of bonds will be credited to the securities clearance accounts of the syndicate members and can then be transferred to the accounts of the investors.

The clearing systems also keep a record of interest payment dates and redemption dates for each issue, and will ‘present’ the securities for payment when appropriate.

The clearing systems will also act on investors’ instructions with respect to any options or conversion rights attached to the securities.

## International Capital Markets Association (ICMA)

- Formed in July 2005.
- Association for financial institutions which play an active role, usually as managers, underwriters and traders, in the primary and secondary bond markets.
- Trade association, as opposed to a statutory body, created by participants in the international capital markets with a view to establishing recognised standards of market practice.
- Membership of ICMA brings a financial institution the status and recognition.
- Self-regulating body: ultimate sanction for non-compliance is expulsion $\rightarrow$ very problematic for the offender because they're an outcast.
- Publishes recommendations in a handbook, covering:
	- Timing of a bond issue (between stages)
	- Minimum content of some documents
	- Timescale to be allowed for payment of fees and commissions.

## Issuers

- Companies
- Governments/ sovereign entities
- Public authorities
- Supranationals

## Credit Ratings

Investors are sensitive to risk, so most issuers and/or debt security issues will be given a credit rating. Dominated by:

- Standard & Poor's
- Moody's
- Fitch.

The credit rating is an opinion on the risk of default on payment. Ratings split into “investment grade” and “speculative grade”.

| Ratings agency | Investment grade | Speculative grade (junk) |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| S&P            | AAA, AA, A, BBB  | BB, B, CCC, CC, C, D     |
| Moody's        | Aaa, Aa, A, Baa  | Ba, B, Caa, Ca, C        |

A rating is usually assigned at launch of the issue. The rating given to an issue is then periodically reviewed.

2008 exposed that ratings agencies were paid by the issuer to give a rating, giving rise to something of a conflict of interest. In the UK, FCA supervises rating agencies.

# Bonds - Legal

## Form of a Bond

The first eurobond issued in 1963. Early investors held printed bearer certificates with tear-off coupons. These certificates are known as ‘definitive bearer bonds’. Then clearing houses came along (late 60s, early 70s).

Bonds typically take:

1. temporary global form, followed by either:
	1. permanent global form, or
	2. definitive form (which may be bearer or registered); or
2. permanent global form from the outset.

### Temporary Global Form

#### What

- The total debt obligation of the issuer will, instead, usually start life as a single document known as a ‘temporary global note’.
- Document representing all the bonds to be offered under that issue
- Executed by an authorised officer of the issuer and authenticated by the fiscal agent/ principal paying agent.
- T&Cs which apply to the bonds also incorporated in the temporary global note.
- Schedule attached, on which the fiscal agent/ principal paying agent can record all exchanges of the temporary global note and interest payments.

#### Why

##### Time Constraints

- Many bond issues (in particular, eurobond issues) have a timescale of three to five weeks between launch (i.e., when the offer is announced) and closing (i.e., issue of the bonds).
- This timetable is primarily driven by market practice: issuing a bond is intended to be a relatively quick way for a borrower to raise finance, and the markets therefore have an expectation to fulfil.
- However, such a short timetable makes it difficult to complete the security printing and necessary ‘authentication’ of the certificates which represents the final definitive form of a bearer bond.
- The issued temporary global note can be placed in a clearing system.

##### Selling Restrictions

- Most jurisdictions impose restrictions on securities being offered or sold within that jurisdiction.
- Many of these restrictions are imposed on issues made to the public in order to protect unsophisticated investors/ policies of investment control or taxation.
- To avoid contravening any restrictions which might apply to it, a bond will include contractual restrictions on the institutions selling the issue (the ‘syndicate’). These are known as ‘selling restrictions’.

> [!note]
> The most commonly applicable selling restrictions are those imposed under US tax and securities laws. Some of these require that definitive bonds cannot be delivered for a period (usually 40 days) after issue (known as a ‘lock-up’ period). More commonly, there will be a restricted period during which definitive bonds may be offered only to certain investors. So temporary global note helps. 

Once any lock-up period expires, the temporary global note must be exchanged for either a permanent global note (permanent version of the temporary global note), or bonds in definitive form (separate certificates representing each bond).

#### Permanent Global Note

Word processed document prepared by the lead manager's solicitor representing all the bonds in issue. Issued on the closing date of the issue and held by a bank called the “common depository” for safekeeping.

The main advantage of using a permanent global note rather than definitive bonds is cost, since the permanent global note is not security printed.

But leaves bondholders without a bearer instrument with which to prove ownership. In circumstances where it is important that the investor has legal ownership of the debt obligation represented by the bond, the terms and conditions require the issuer to print definitive bearer bonds and distribute them to the investors. The permanent global notes state the circumstances in which definitives should be printed.

> [!warning] Potential issue
> Even if the global note states that the issuer must print definitive bonds (providing the investor with legal ownership), the issuer may refuse to comply with that condition.

Solution:

1. Provide investors with direct rights of enforcement in the text of the global note itself.
2. Issuer executes a unilateral deed of covenant (deed poll) in favour of the bondholders from time to time. Contains a declaration by the issue to pay those shown as investors on the clearing systems $\rightarrow$ provides a contractual link between issuer and investors.
3. Appoint a trustee to the issue, which holds the issuer covenant to pay on trust for the bondholders. The trustee can then enforce on the bondholders' behalf.

#### Definitive Form

A bond issued in “definitive form” can be a bearer or registered instrument.

##### Bearer Bonds

The most familiar bearer instrument to most people is currency (e.g., a £5 note). Bearer bonds are similar. Security printed documents to make forgery difficult. Issuer’s debt obligation is printed on the bond itself and ownership can be transferred by physical delivery.

Features:

- A promise to pay
	- Signed by at least 1 officer of the issuer - as part of the security printing
	- Each instrument individually authenticated (signed) by the fiscal agent/ paying agent and not valid until this is done.
- T&Cs
	- Usually printed on the reverse, together with the addresses of the relevant paying agents.
- Coupons
	- If the bond bears interest, coupons are printed on the RHS of the bearer bond which are torn off and surrendered to the paying interest to claim payment.
- Talons
	- The maximum number of coupons which can be attached to a eurobond is 27 (under ICMA rules).
	- If a bond carries more than 27 interest payment dates, the final coupon (at the top left of the coupon sheet next to the bond) will be known as a ‘talon’. The talon can be exchanged for a further sheet of coupons.

##### Registered Bonds

Create a promise to pay the person whose name appears on a register of bondholders held by the issuer (or its agent for this purpose) rather than the holder of the actual bond certificate. Registered bonds can be transferred only by an entry on the register; title will not pass by physical delivery of the bond instrument. Rare.

## Legal Nature of a Bond

### Transferability

2 methods:

- Transfer by physical delivery – bearer instrument.
- Transfer by registration – registrable instrument.

### Negotiability

Usually, the jurisdiction in which the ‘negotiation’ takes place is relevant: in the case of a bearer bond, this will be the place where the bond is delivered. In a conflict of laws situation, negotiable instruments are usually treated as chattels because the debt claim is represented by a tangible document rather than a simple ‘book entry’.

- By statute
	- The Bills of Exchange Act 1882 confers negotiability on bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques – but bonds are generally not certain enough to fall within these provisions.
- By mercantile custom
	- It is an established principle of English common law that an instrument can achieve negotiability simply because it is customarily treated as negotiable in the ‘markets’ in which it is usually traded.
	- So definitive bearer bonds are negotiable by mercantile custom.

#### Consequences

The consequences of negotiability work in favour of a transferee who purchases the bond bona fide, for value and without any actual notice of a defect in title (known as a ‘holder in due course’). A negotiable bond purchased by a ‘holder in due course’ will have the following benefits:

1. the purchaser can obtain better title than the seller;
2. the purchaser will take a clean legal title to the bond and is entitled to payment in full, notwithstanding any claims of set-off or other defence which the issuer may have had against any previous holder;
3. the purchaser can sue the issuer directly in the case of a dispute over the bond, and does not need to join the transferor in a claim;
4. if a ‘holder in due course’ presents a stolen bond, the issuer must pay out on that bond as well as on any replacement bond it has issued to the original bondholder.

> [!action]
> An issuer will not usually provide a replacement bond without first obtaining an indemnity from the original bondholder to the effect that they will recompense the issuer if it has to pay out on the original bond.

## Registered Vs Bearer Bonds

| Matter                        | Bearer bond                                                                                            | Registered bond                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title                         | Bona fide purchaser for value without notice of a bearer bond can obtain better title than the seller. | Not a negotiable instrument, so buyer does not obtain good title if the seller stole the bond certificate.       |
| Claims and defences of issuer | Negotiable bearer bonds always sold free from any claim the issuer may have had.                       | Purchaser is (theoretically) subject to the rights the issuer might have against the transferor                  |
| Priorities                    | Purchaser takes the bond free of any equities (3rd party claims).                                      | Purchaser only taks the bond free of competing interests of which they had no actual or constructive notice.     |
| Anonymity                     | Can be held anonymously.                                                                               | Issuer will know the identity of a registered holder (but beneficial ownership may lie behind a nominee holder). |
| Transfer                      | By delivery                                                                                            | Execution of an instrument of transfer and filing of the instrument and original bond certificate with the issuer/ its agent for that purpose, and an amendment to the register.                                                                                                                  |

## Bearer Bonds in Clearing Systems

It is unusual for definitive bearer bonds to be printed and held in a depositary. Some investors may not actually be ‘participants’ in a clearing system, but will rely on a financial institution which is a participant to act as their nominee.

A definitive bearer bond transaction will then involve a chain of parties:

MERMAID1

The investors (i.e., bondholders) give the bond to a participant (i.e., an entity holding accounts with the clearing system – assuming the investor is not a participant itself), which must give the bond to the clearing system (e.g., Euroclear or Clearstream), which in turn gives the instrument to a depositary bank for safekeeping.

If any of these parties goes into liquidation in possession of the investor’s bearer securities, the investor will be left to claim as an unsecured creditor. The way to avoid this risk is to ensure that the proprietary rights over the securities remain with the investor and are not vested in any of the other parties in the chain.

### Investor – Participant

- Law is the governing law chosen in the documentation.
- Under English law, TRUST: the deposit of bearer securities with a participant will result in the investor passing legal title to the participant, but the investor retaining beneficial ownership.
	- The participant therefore takes all the rights against the issuer such as payment of coupon and principal, and any conversion rights.
	- Participant must account for payments received and transfer security back at the investor's request.
	- The investor can also demand the return of the bonds in the event of the participant’s liquidation and they will not become part of the participant’s general pool of assets.

### Participant – Clearing System

- Euroclear is Belgian, Clearstream is Luxembourg, so these are the respective governing laws of the clearing systems.
- The participants retain a proprietary right of ownership in the securities credited to their securities clearance account.
- Therefore, if Euroclear should become insolvent, the participants will not be unsecured creditors but will have the right to the return of the securities which are credited to their securities account.

### Clearing Systems – Depository

The final link in the chain is that between the clearing system and the depositary bank. This relationship is subject not only to the local law of the relevant clearing system, but also to the law of the jurisdiction in which the depository is situated.

> [!action]
> Participant msut ensure that the proprietary rights in the bearer securities are not in any way transferred to the depository bank. Often participants take a legal opinion from a local lawyer to this effect. 

# Bond Issue

Eurobond – it is a bond denominated in a globally recognised currency which is not the currency of the country in which the bond is issued. Took off in the 80s (Liar's Poker).

## Parties

### Issuer

- If the issuer is a debut issuer, prospectus will need drafting from scratch
- If there have been previous issues, can just update the prospectus.
- For eurobonds, if the company does not have use for the denominated currency, derivative/ FX transaction entered into to exchange into local currency.

### Lead Manager

- Investment bank
- Similar role to the arranger in a syndicated loan.
- Responsible for arranging bond issue and managing process
- Will advise the issuer on structure, timing, price etc.
- If the issue is to be listed, the lead manager will usually be the ‘sponsor’ required by the UKLA to provide confirmations for listing.

### Syndicate

- Lead managers recruits co-managers to join a syndicate.
- Distribution network for the issue – book building for the issue.
- Usually the syndicate underwrites the issue (so will take the bonds if no buyers can be found).
- The names of the syndicate will appear on the prospectus in order of contribution to the amount of the issue that they have sold.
- Occasionally (usually for high yield bonds) the syndicate will only have to use ‘reasonable endeavours’ to sell the securities.

### Fiscal Agent and Trustee

A bond issue will use either a fiscal agent (under a fiscal agency agreement), or a trustee (under a trust deed).

#### Fiscal Agent

The fiscal agent is appointed by, and is the representative and agent of, the issuer and not the bondholders.

- It is primarily responsible for paying principal and interest to the bondholders.
- Administrative functions (e.g., publishing notices, acting as depository).
- Fiscal agency agreement will stipulate that the agent does not owe the bondholders any duty of care.

#### Trustee

A trustee is initially chosen and appointed by the issuer (through its advisers) but represents the interests of the bondholders.

- The property held on trust is the issuer’s covenant to pay the bondholders.
- The trustee’s powers and duties are recorded in a trust deed, but it will also owe the bondholders a duty of care under common law trust principles.
- In a bond transaction, the trustee is likely to be either a professional trust association (e.g., The Law Debenture Trust Corporation), or a subsidiary of a bank or other financial institution with this function.

#### Choice

Fiscal agent usually used because cheaper. But trustee used where a fiscal agent is insufficient:

1. Secured issues
	- If the bonds are secured, a trustee is required to hold the security. This is primarily due to the impracticality of providing individual bondholders with a right to part of the security.
	- The trustee holds the security on trust for all the bondholders from time to time.
	- A fiscal agent cannot perform this function since it is the agent of the issuer and so acts in the issuer’s interests.
2. Subordinated issues
	 - If bonds are to be issued which are subordinated to the repayment of another bond issue, the same trustee may be appointed to both senior and junior issues to ensure effective subordination.
	 - Alternatively, achieve this contractually through the issue terms (contingent debt)

#### Trust Advantages

For issuer:

- Only the trustee can act in the event of a default by the issuer $\rightarrow$ more considered approach towards default than if the bondholders could individually bring claims.
- Trust instrument may provide the trustee authority to waive technical events of default where fit.
- [[Concord Trust v The Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc [2005] UKHL 27]]: if a trustee mistakenly called an event of default this is not a breach of contract, but simply an ‘ineffective action’.
- More flexible: A trustee can be given power to agree certain amendments to the terms of a bond without calling a meeting of bondholders.

For bondholders:

- Professional entity to pursue the issuer on an event of default. Individual action can be expensive and difficult; class actions are hard.
- Trustee more likely to achieve a moratorium/ negotiated resolution than individual bondholders.
- If bondholders need to decide something collectively, the trustee can chair
- Role of trustee avoids a powerful bondholder negotiating a better deal at the expense of minority bondholders on a default
- Trustee has investigative and monitoring powers. The common law duty to act with due diligence in the best interests of the beneficiaries (i.e., the bondholders) is still applicable irrespective of the contractual requirements of the trust deed.

#### Fiscal Agent Advantages

- Cost
	- Trustee requires its own solicitor to advise on trust documentation.
	- Competition to take the prestigious role of fiscal agent. Often banks will do it for free, bundled with another role they are given.

### Listing Agent

When listing on certain exchanges a listing agent must be appointed by an issuer to communicate with the listing authority on its behalf, to lodge the necessary documents with the listing authority, and to advise the issuer on the listing rules and process.

### Principal Paying Agent and Paying Agents

A paying agent is an agent of the issuer responsible for co-ordinating payments of principal and interest under the bond. Payment received by the issuer and distributed to paying agents, who pay bondholders in their jurisdictions.

If an issuer uses a fiscal agent, it will usually take the role of principal paying agent.

### Depository and Common Depository

A depository is a bank appointed on behalf of a clearing system dealing with a particular issue to act as ‘safe keeper’ of the temporary global note, the permanent global note, and any definitive bearer bonds traded through a clearing system. If an issue uses more than one clearing system, each system must use the same depository, and it will be known as the ‘common depository’.

Using a depository also allows the bonds to be kept in jurisdictions other than those of the clearing systems (tax advantages). The use of a depository to hold the bonds is sometimes known as ‘immobilisation’.

> [!question] When can a global note not be placed with a common depository?
> Some issuers will want their securities to be recognised by the European Central Bank as ‘eligible collateral’ for the euro central banking system (Eurosystem). From July 2006, securities are only eligible as Eurosystem collateral if their global form is held by the clearing system themselves and not at a common depository.

## Legal Advisers

Separately appointed by the issuer and the lead manager. If the issue involves a trust instrument, trustees also instruct solicitors. Roles:

- Preparing documentation
- Due diligence
- Producing a legal opinion for the transaction.

### Auditors

Auditors will be involved in the issue process whenever the issuer is an entity which produces accounts. The lead manager and its legal advisers will want to review the issuer’s accounts for at least the previous three years. If the issue is to be listed, audited accounts may need publishing/ incorporation by reference.

## Bond Issue Documentation

### Underwriting, Subscription and Distribution

1. mandate letter;  
2. initial syndicate communication (formerly known as ‘invitation telex’);  
3. allotment confirmation (formerly known as ‘allotment telex’);  
4. prospectus or other offering document;  
5. subscription agreement (or underwriting agreement);  
6. agreement among managers;  
7. auditor’s report and consent letter;  
8. auditor’s comfort letters;  
9. legal opinions.

### Bonds and Related Documents

1. Fiscal agency agreement (including paying agency agreement) (or trust deed);  
2. paying agency agreement (if no fiscal agent);  
3. temporary global note;  
4. permanent global note (or definitive form bond);  
5. deed of guarantee (if the issue is guaranteed and there is no trust deed);  
6. deed of covenant (if no trustee, and bonds are in permanent global form).

### Mandate Letter

This confirms the fundamental terms of the issue. Authorises the lead manager to announce the issue and invite other institutions to form a syndicate. Mandate letter prepared by the lead manager.

### Initial Syndicate Communication

- Document sent by the lead manager to prospective co-managers inviting them to participate in the issue by subscribing for bonds.
- If the issue is underwritten, co-managers will be requested to give an underwriting commitment.
- The requirement to send an initial syndicate communication, and its minimum content, are governed by ICMA rules.

### Allotment Confirmation

- Allocation (of the issue) is at the sole discretion of the lead manager.
	- In a traditional retention structure, the lead manager notifies co-managers of their allocation.
	- Where a ‘pot’ system is used, the co-managers reveal the identity of the investors they have identified to the lead manager, who then notifies them directly of their allocated amount.
- Investors pay purchase price to lead manager. Lead manager pays commission to comanagers for finding investors.
- Allotments must be made within 24 hours of the launch of an issue.

### Prospectus/ Listing Particulars

The prospectus is the document which provides detailed information about an issue for potential investors. If the issue is to be listed on the London Stock Exchange Professional Securities Market (‘PSM’) then this document is known as the ‘listing particulars’.

### Subscription/ Underwriting Agreement

> [!defn] Subscription agreement
> The subscription agreement is a contract between the issuer, the lead manager and the co-managers which records the basis on which the issuer will sell, and the managers will buy, the bonds on issue.

Most London market bonds work on the basis that the syndicate will subscribe for all of the bonds between them, even if they cannot place them with investors. Under the terms of the subscription agreement, the liability of the syndicate members to the issuer of an issue is joint and several (key difference with a syndicated loan).

Whilst the managers will agree between themselves how many bonds they will each subscribe for (in the ‘agreement among managers’), the subscription agreement allows an issuer to require any one manager to subscribe for the entire bond issue if necessary.

Will also cover:

- CPs to the issue (e.g., legal opinions, auditors' consent, comfort letters)
- Pricing of the issue
- Managers fees and commissions
- Costs and expenses paid to the issuer
- Representations and warranties given to each manager
- Representation from managers that they will comply with applicable selling restrictions
- Fore majeure clause (allowing lead manager to terminate the syndicate's obligations).

### Agreement Among Managers

Agreement among managers is a contract between the lead manager and co-managers. Main purpose: to record the number of bonds which each member of the syndicate has agreed to take. Also covers payment and commission.

### Auditor's Report, Consent Letter, Comfort Letters

- Auditors required to sign off accounts
- Auditors asked to provide a consent letter consenting to the printing of their report and comfort letters to the managers confirming
	- No MAC
	- Unaudited financial information is correct.
- 2 comfort letters: one at signing and one at closing. These are legally binding on the auditors (similar to legal opinions).

### Legal Opinions

Required by the lead manager, co-managers and the trustee. Two required:

1. From the lead manager's solicitors wrt the binding nature of the documentation
2. From the issuer's solicitors confirming the due incorporation of the issuer, consents obtained, taxation, and enforceability of contractual documents against the issuer.

### Fiscal Agency Agreement

- Contract between the issuer, fiscal agent, and any other paying agents.
- Records the structure through which the bondholders will receive payment of coupon and principal.
- If the issue uses a trust arrangement then it will require a ‘principal paying agent’ (usually a bank); if a fiscal agent is used, it will perform the function of a principal paying agent.
- Further paying agents will need to be appointed if an issue requires payments to be made in jurisdictions outside that of the principal paying agent.

Will document:

- the procedure for authentication of the temporary global note and definitive bonds;
- the process necessary to exchange the temporary global note for definitive bonds;
- the issue of replacement bonds;
- the procedures for convening the bondholders’ meetings;
- fees and expenses of the paying agents.
- Full T&Cs of the bonds.

### Paying Agency Agreement

If a bond issue uses a trust arrangement, the trustee is not responsible for making any payments of coupon or principal. A ‘principal paying agent’ must be appointed under a separate agreement with the issuer. This is known as the ‘paying agency agreement’.

### Trust Deed

Details:

- Creation of trust
- Trust property
- Trust powers and duties
- Appointment and removal of trustees
- Requirements for bondholder meetings
- Monitoring of the issuer's financial position..

### Deed of Guarantee

Some corporate issuers may use a subsidiary to issue securities and raise finance. Often SPVs. Unlikely to be investment grade – so the parent company will guarantee the SPV's obligations under the bond.

The guarantee may be endorsed on the bond itself, or separately in a deed of guarantee.

### Deed of Covenant

If a note is in permanent global form (i.e., there are no definitive bonds) then the legal owner of the note is the common depositary bank since it is the bearer (holding the note on behalf of the clearing system).

The global note is exchangeable for definitives, but the issuer may be unwilling to comply in a non-payment situation – leaving the bondholders unable to enforce their claim.

- With a trust this isn't an issue: the trustee holds the issuer’s covenant to pay on trust for the bondholders.
- But if a fiscal agent is used, it is necessary to create a document which gives the bondholders a right to sue the issuer in accordance with their bond allocations shown in the clearing systems.
- That document is known as a deed of covenant: a promise to pay executed by the issuer in a deed poll, and which gives bondholders the right to claim against the issuer in accordance with their bond allocation shown on clearing system accounts.

## Bond T&Cs

### Comparison with a Facility Agreement

The terms in a bond are generally both fewer and shorter than the terms in most commercial facility agreements and very standardised.

Bondholder's concerns:

1. the issuer’s and the issue’s credit rating;
2. the amount of its investment;
3. the return it will receive on its investment;
4. when it is able to redeem its investment;
5. its rights on the issuer’s default ranking *pari passu* with any other holders of the same or similar debt instruments of the issuer.

Bondholder doesn't care about financial covenants unless the bond is a high yield bond. So no detailed reps and warranties!

### T&Cs Location

Govern how a bond instrument operates once it has been issued. Complete list found in lots of places:

1. in the temporary global note;
2. on the back of the definitive bearer (or registered) bond, or in the permanent global note;
3. as a schedule to the fiscal agency agreement (or trust deed);
4. sometimes in the paying agency agreement (if there is a trustee);
5. in the prospectus (or listing particulars).

Debt obligation is evident in the bond and is the property held on trust if a trustee is appointed.

### Specific T&Cs

- Preamble
	- May confirm the authorisation of the issue, lists parties, dates and contractual documents.
- Form, denomination and title.
	- Form: bearer, registered or global
	- Amounts in which bonds issued
	- Statement as to how title to the bonds will pass.
- Status
	- Specifies characteristic of the debt obligation and its ranking among other debt obligations
	- Bonds usually unsecured.
- Negative pledge
	- Usually less onerous than commercial banking loan
	- Ensures the issuer will not issue debt securities ranking higher than the current issue, unless bondholders of the current issue receive identical rights.
- Coupon
	- If fixed, payable annually in arrear
	- If floating, calculated and paid as stipulated in the payment clause.
	- The coupon payment dates will usually be the same dates in the appropriate months depending on the commencement date of the issue itself (so long as business days)
	- Fixed rate bonds issued after 1 January 1999 usually use the ‘Actual/Actual’ convention. Different interpretations of this – the most common is the ICMA method: actual days elapsed over the product of the number of days in a coupon period and the number of coupon periods.
	- For floating rate notes (and syndicated loans, for most currencies other than sterling), the ‘Actual/360’ or ‘365/360’ basis is usually used.
	- This applies the ‘annual’ rate (x%) to the principal sum as if it were x% per 360 days.
- Payments
	- Definitive bearer bond: surrender of the bond for payment of principal; surrender of relevant coupon for interest. Effected through paying agents who are the agents of the issuer (recall facility agreements – agents of lenders).
	- Most bonds held in clearing systems so payments made from paying agents directly to clearing systems which credit money accordingly.
- Redemption and purchase
	- Bond can be redeemed:
		- On maturity, at par
		- For tax reasons (tax redemption clause – redemption of the entire issue if as a result of a change in tax laws, issuer is required to gross of payments of interest or capital).
		- Repurchase – nothing to stop an issuer purchasing its own bonds on the secondary market. If listed, LRs require issuer to notify all bondholders of intentions. Purchases by tender offer must be made to all bondholders.
- Taxation
	- An issuer will be required to gross up payments to investors in very limited circumstances, since the issuer has little control over the bondholder’s identity and tax domicile.
	- Any grossing-up obligation is usually restricted to taxes imposed by the issuer’s own jurisdiction and would benefit only ‘non-domestic’ investors.
- Events of default
	- Less onerous than a facility agreement.
	- Default for non-payment will have a (typically) 14-day grace period.
- Prescription
	- Period for which a bondholder must claim principal and coupon (usually 10 years and 5 years respectively) from the due date for payment. At the end of the prescription period, the debt is actually extinguished not just action barred.
- Bond/ coupon replacement
	- Provision deals with lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed bonds.
	- The condition for replacement of bonds and coupons therefore provides that the bondholder claiming a replacement must indemnify the issuer in respect of any payments the issuer has to make on the original bond or coupon and pay all expenses of the issuer in making such a replacement.
- Meetings of bondholders
	- The procedure for convening bondholders’ meetings and the conducting of business thereat is provided for in the fiscal agency agreement (or trust deed).
	- Trustee convenes meetings (own initiative of at request of 10% of bondholders)
	- Usually only convened if there is a problem/ modifications of the T&Cs are required.
	- Conditions governing meetings usually in standard form.
	- Strict quorum requirements.
	- Under English law, there are no specific statutory requirements as to when a majority can bind a minority of bondholders. However, in order to protect the minority, English euromarket practice dictates that the majority of bondholders required to pass an extraordinary resolution is 75%.
- Notices
	- However, the identity of bond investors will not be known, and therefore notice can be given only by one or more of an RIS, the FCA or a national newspaper.
	- LSE has its own notification requirements (must also notify the exchange when notifying bond holders).
	- Notices of meetings for holders of London listed debt securities in bearer form must usually be placed in a leading national newspaper circulating in the UK, and a copy of the notice must be sent to the Company Announcements Office of the London Stock Exchange.
- Further issues
	- Issuer permitted to issue further bonds with same T&Cs as the ones in issue.
	- Allowed without the consent of the bondholders.
- Governing law and jurisdiction
	- Boiler plate clauses
	- Usually English law and English courts.

# Prospectus & Listing

International bonds are usually listed:

- Tax efficiency
- Investor demand

London-based bond listed in either London, Ireland or Luxembourg.

## London Listing

Listing a bond in London required:

1. Admission to the Official List; and
2. Admission to trading on either a regulated or unregulated market.

### Official List Admission

Effectively = satisfying legal requirements.

The new regime (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129) is commonly referred to as the Prospectus Regulation or ‘PD3’ and replaced the previous EU prospectus regime in full.

The UK ‘onshored’ the Prospectus Regulation, incorporating its provisions into English law, by way of the Prospectus (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/1234), the Official Listing of Securities, Prospectus and Transparency (Amendment etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/707) and the Financial Services (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/628).

FCA is the competent authority to implement UK Listing Rules, but delegates this task to a division – the UK Listing Authority (UKLA).

The UKLA’s implementation of the Listing Rules takes the form of the Listing Rules (LR), Prospectus Regulation Rules (PRR) sourcebook and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) sourcebook in the FCA Handbook.

### Admission to Trading

Two markets:

- The London Stock Exchange’s ‘Main Market’
	- EEA ‘regulated market’, for the purposes of many EU Directives and Regulations.
	- Requires publication of a UKLA-approved disclosure document known as a ‘prospectus’ which complies with the Prospectus Regulation.
- The Professional Securities Market (PSM) is an ‘unregulated market’.
	- Slightly more relaxed regime than the Main Market.
	- Requires publication of a UKLA-approved disclosure document known as ‘listing particulars’ rather than a prospectus.
	- As the PSM is regulated by the stock exchange, the UK Prospectus Regulation does **not** apply to securities listed on this market.

Bonds may also be admitted to trading on the International Securities Market (ISM). The disclosure rules were created by the London Stock Exchange (rather than the UKLA), and the London Stock Exchange (rather than the UKLA) reviews the admission particulars. There is no listing – but still a tax advantage. Need to produce “admission particulars”, rather than listing particulars or a prospectus.

The ISM was introduced 5 years ago to try to stop people listing bonds in Ireland and Luxembourg.

## Approved Prospectus

> [!tip]
> A prospectus approved by the UKLA is essentially required (as a prerequisite) if a bond issue is to be offered to the public or admitted to trading on the Main Market.

Following the UK’s exit from the EU, passporting (or “mutual recognition”) of prospectuses is no longer possible.

Any EU issuer that wishes to offer to the public or admit to trading on the Main Market any securities must now secure approval of their prospectus from the FCA, in accordance with UK Prospectus, even if approval has already been secured from an EU member state regulator.

### Exempt Bonds

Certain exempt securities are listed in the Prospectus Regulation, the Prospectus Regulation Rules (PRR) sourcebook and also in Sch 11A to the FSMA 2000. Mostly not relevant for a corporate offer.

### Exempt Offers

Even if the bond is offered to the public, in the UK there are exemptions from producing an approved prospectus provided that the bond is not admitted to trading on a regulated market (e.g., if offered on the PSM). Exemptions found in the Prospectus Regulation at Article 1.4 and are referenced in s 86 of the FSMA 2000 and in PRR 1.2.3. The exemptions focus on offers which are not targeting the ‘general public’.

This includes:

- An offer which is made to or directed at ‘qualified investors’
- An offer which is made to or directed at fewer than 150 persons (other than ‘qualified investors’) per EEA State;
- The minimum consideration which may be paid by any person pursuant to the securities offer is €100,000 (or equivalent);
- Where the securities have a minimum denomination of €100,000 (or equivalent), often referred to as a ‘wholesale’ offer;
- Where the total consideration for the securities is less than €8 million. This exemption derives from Article 3.2 of the Prospectus Regulation.

## Prospectus Contents

### Authority

UKLA has authority to dictate listing particulars from s 79 FSMA 2000 $\rightarrow$ Listing Rules can require that securities may not be admitted to the official list unless:

1. listing particulars have been submitted to, and approved by, the competent authority and published, or
2. in such cases as may be specified by listing rules, such document … as may be so specified has been published.

### General Content

Prospectus Regulation Rule (PRR) 2.1.1 replicates the general content requirements contained in Article 6(1) of the Prospectus Regulation on the ‘necessary information’ to be contained in the prospectus: information which is material to an investor for making an informed assessment of:

1. the assets and liabilities, profits and losses, financial position and prospects of the issuer and of any guarantor;
2. the rights attaching to the securities; and
3. the reasons for the issuance and its impact on the issuer.

The information may vary depending on:

- The nature of the issuer.
- The type of securities.
- The circumstances of the issuer.
- In respect of non-equity securities, whether or not the securities have a denomination per unit of at least EUR100,000 or are to be traded only on a regulated market, or specific segment thereof, to which only qualified investors have access for the purpose of trading those securities.

> [!tip]
> The level of detail required in a prospectus will depend on whether it is a ‘retail’ (ie ‘nonexempt’) or ‘wholesale’ (ie ‘exempt’) offer. The ‘wholesale’ regime requires less detailed disclosure, but applies only if the securities are denominated at or above €100,000.

### Prospectus Format

Format outlined at PRR 2.2. For a stand-alone bond issue, can either have a single document or 3 separate documents;

1. Registration document – information relating to the seller
2. Securities note – information relating to the bonds.
3. Summary – retail only (max. 7 sides A4).

Registration document is valid for 12 months so can be re-used for multiple issues in that period. But most stand-alone issues just use a single document.

Art 8 Prospectus Regulation (PRR 2.2.3) allows the issuer of a debt programme (e.g., an MTN programme) to use a ‘base prospectus’ (containing the main information on issuer and programme) and a ‘final terms’ document (which contains information on each particular securities issue under the programme).

### Listing Particulars

Listing particulars are required when a bond is

- Admitted to trading on PSM
- Admitted to trading on LSE but does not require a prospectus under Prospectus Regulation.

### Responsibility for Information

s 84(1)(d) of the FSMA 2000 allows the PRR to specify who is responsible for a prospectus, and for a bond PRR 5.3.5 specifies that this includes:

1. the issuer;
2. anyone who accepts (and the prospectus states as accepting) responsibility;
3. the offeror (if this is not the issuer);
4. the person requesting admission to trading (if this is not the issuer);
5. any guarantor (in relation to information on them or the guarantee); and
6. anyone else who has authorised the contents of the prospectus.

For a bond, the issuer's directors are not required to take responsibility for the prospectus. PR 2.3: each of those responsible must make a declaration in the prospectus that;

> [ ] accepts responsibility for the information contained in this document. To the best of their knowledge and belief the information contained in this document is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such information.

### Key Issuer Information

| Category  | Minimum denomination | Relevant disclosure annexes |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Wholesale | $\geq 100,000$ EUR   | 7, 15                       |
| Retail    | $< 100,000$ EUR      | 6, 14                            |

The FCA operates a "Wholesale Debt Approach" to reviewing prospectuses and listing particulars for wholesale debt issues. This approach generally means a faster review process with fewer rounds of comments than for higher-risk issues such as retail issues or complex debt issues.

Annexes are of Commission Delegated Regulation 2019/980.

The minimum disclosure requirements for information relating to the issuer under the more onerous ‘retail’ regime include the following:

- Persons responsible
- Financial information
	- Audited accounts for 2 years
	- IFRS/ GAAP accounting
- Risk factors
	- Grouped into categories; most material first
- Information about the issuer
	- Name, registration number, registered office etc.
	- Recent events particular to the issuer which are to a material extent relevant to the evaluation of the issuer's solvency.
- Business overview
	- Issuer's activities, new products and markets
	- Statement of no material adverse change in the prospects of the issuer since last accounts.
- Admin, management, supervisory bodies, (controlling) shareholders
- Material contracts and displaying documents
	- The prospectus must summarise any material contracts ‘not entered into in the ordinary course of the issuer’s business’ which could result in any member of the group being under an obligation or entitlement that is material to the issuer’s obligations under the securities.
	- Hyperlinks to certain ‘display documents’ (e.g. the memorandum and articles, reports, valuations, etc) which may be inspected.

### Bond Information

Minimum disclosure requirements for information relating to the bonds:

- Use of proceeds
- Information about the securities
	- type (e.g., registered or bearer), currency, ranking, coupon, maturity and governing law.
	- T&Cs of the offer
- Repeated information
	- Under Article 19 of the Prospectus Regulation, an issuer may incorporate certain information by reference into the prospectus.
	- The summary document must not incorporate information by reference.

## General Duty of Disclosure

Art 6 Prospectus Regulation: prospectus must contain the necessary information which is material to an investor for making an informed assessment of:

1. the assets and liabilities, profits and losses, financial position and prospects of the issuer and of any guarantor;
2. the rights attaching to the securities; and
3. the reasons for the issuance and its impact on the issuer.

Article 6 also states that in determining what information is required to comply with this obligation, account must be taken of ‘the type of securities and their issuer’.

Similar disclosure obligation: s 80 FSMA 2000 – must consider;

1. the nature of the persons who are likely to consider acquiring the securities;
2. the fact that certain matters may reasonably be expected to be within the knowledge of professional advisers of any kind which those persons may reasonably be expected to consult; and
3. any information available to investors or their professional advisers by virtue of requirements imposed by listing rules, by any other legislation or by a recognised investment exchange.

Prospectus Regulations require all retail prospectuses to be drafted in plain language, with additional descriptive text on how to navigate the prospectus.

## Omission of Information

The requirements for bonds are, however, generally less wide-ranging than for equity issues, reflecting the more sophisticated investor base of the former.

Rules list limited circumstances in which the UKLA can authorise the omission of information.

Article 18 of the Prospectus Regulation (PRR 2.8), an exemption from the duty to disclose (whether that duty arises under the Rules, s 87A or s 80) may be granted if:

1. disclosure would be contrary to the public interest;
2. disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the issuer of the securities ; or
3. the information is of minor importance only and not such as to influence the assessment of the assets and liabilities, financial position, profits and losses and prospects of the issuer.

## Liability for Prospectus and Listing Particulars

Misstatements and omissions can give rise to civil/ criminal liability.

### Civil Liability

#### FSMA 2000

s 90 FSMA 2000 applies to both a prospectus and any supplementary prospectus.

Anyone responsible for those documents is liable to compensate any person who acquires any of the securities and suffers loss in respect of them ‘as a result of any untrue or misleading statement in the [prospectus] or any omission from them of any matter required to be included’ under the general disclosure obligation.

- Section concerned with a loss suffered by a person who has acquired any of the securities.
	- May include subsequent purchasers on a secondary market.
- Person concerned must establish that they suffered loss in respect of the securities as a result of the offending statement/ omission.
	- Condition satisfied if the price paid for the securities is higher than it would be but for the error/ omission.
	- Not necessary to have reliance.

##### Defences

Sch 10 FSMA 2000 defences include:

1. That at the time the prospectus was submitted to the UKLA they reasonably believed, having made such enquiries (if any) as were reasonable, that the statement was true and not misleading, or that the matter the omission of which caused the loss was properly omitted. Additionally, must establish one of the following:
	1. Belief continued until the time the securities were acquired
	2. Acquired before reasonably practical to bring a correction to the attention of persons likely to acquire the securities
	3. Before the securities were acquired, they had taken all such steps as reasonable for them to have taken to ensure a correction was brought to the attention of those persons.
	4. Continued in that belief until after the commencement of dealings in the securities following listing.
2. Where the alleged loss arises as a result of an expert’s statement, and that the person defending the claim reasonably believed that the expert was competent to make or authorise the statement in the prospectus and had consented to its inclusion in the form and context in which it was included.
	1. Must also establish one of (1)-(4) above.
3. Before the securities were acquired they had published a correction ‘in a manner calculated to bring it to the attention of persons likely to acquire the securities’, or, at the very least, that they had taken all such steps as were reasonable for them to secure such publication, which they reasonably believed had taken place before the acquisition.
4. That the loss arose from an official statement or one contained in a public official document, which had been accurately and fairly reproduced in the prospectus.
5. That the investor knew that the statement was false or misleading, or knew the matter which had been omitted.
6. Where the potential liability arose from a failure to provide a supplementary prospectus, and that they reasonably believed that the change or new matter did not warrant them.

#### Negligent Misstatement

[[Hedley Byrne v Heller [1964] AC 465]]!! Misstatements in a prospectus may give rise to liability in tort.

Liability arises if a person suffers loss having relied upon a misstatement and the person who made the misstatement owed a duty of care to the one suffering loss on the faith of it.

Applying the principle to misstatements in a prospectus, it is thought that those assuming responsibility for the prospectus owe a duty of care to those applying for securities in the company on the marketing of those securities, but not to subsequent trading on the secondary market (see [[Caparo Industries v Dickman [1990] 1 All ER 568]]). The inability of a subsequent purchaser to bring a claim for negligent misstatement contrasts with the position in relation to liability under the FSMA 2000; so too does the requirement that the claimant must have relied on the misstatement to their detriment.

#### Misrepresentation Act 1967

A person may be able to rescind the contract for the acquisition and/or claim damages if they acted upon an incorrect/ misleading statement in the prospectus/ an omission from it. Under the 1967 Act, a claim for damages may be made only against the other party to the contract.

#### Contract

If an investor subscribes for and receives securities at the time of their issue, they will have entered into a contract and the prospectus will form part of that contract because of the representations and warranties in the subscription agreement.

If the prospectus is wrong/ misleading, the investor may be entitled to rescind the contract and/ or sue the other contracting party for damages.

- As part of the subscription arrangements, the syndicate of managers generally obtain a number of warranties + indemnities from the issuer.
- If an investor, who does not have the benefit of those warranties, brings a claim against a member of the syndicate, that syndicate member may seek recompense from the issuer under the terms of the warranties and indemnities.

### Criminal Liability

#### FSA 2012 Ss 89 & 90

- s 89 – misleading statements
	- Criminal offence for any person to make a statement which he knows to be false or misleading in a material respect, to conceal dishonestly any material facts or recklessly make a statement which is misleading.
- s 90 – misleading impressions.
	- Catches anything any person does to create a false or misleading impression as to the market in, or price or sale of the shares, if he does so deliberately to induce investors to buy investments, sell them, underwrite them or refrain from so doing or, while knowing the impression to be false or misleading makes a gain or causes a loss.

#### Other Provisions

Liability may also arise under Theft Act/ Fraud Act.

## Golden Belt Case

[[Golden Belt 1 Sukuk Company v BNP Paribas and others [2017] EWHC 3182 (Comm)]] involved Sharia-compliant fixed income capital markets instruments known as ‘sukuk’, which are very similar to bonds.

The court held that an ‘arranging’ bank owed a duty to investors (i.e., holders of sukuk certificates) to exercise reasonable care to ensure the promissory note was properly executed.

# Bond Issue Process

![[bond-parties.png]]

Attraction of euromarkets: speed of fund-raising. Can be 3 weeks for a stand-alone bond. ICMA recommendations have developed a guideline timetable of the issue process. Responsibility of lead manager and solicitor to ensure this is followed..

## Stages

1. Mandate
2. Due diligence
3. Documentation process begins
4. Marketing
5. Launch and syndication
6. Listing
7. Signing
8. Closing

![[bond-issue.png]]

## Mandate

= instructing an investment bank to lead-manage the issue.

Once appointed, the lead manager advises on the most appropriate structure for an issue and the best market. Issuer and lead manager must agree:

- Marketing strategy
- Whether to list
- Identities of fiscal agent/ trustee and paying agents
- Fee structure

Recorded in mandate letter/ term sheet, drafted by the lead manager.

## Due Diligence

Bond issues require due diligence in which the lead manager verifies information needed for the issue. As a general rule, the due diligence process for an issue of equity linked securities will be more ‘in depth’ than for a straight debt issue, since investors in the former may become shareholders in the issuer (different risk).

The lead manager usually conducts the due diligence meeting by asking detailed questions about the other parties to obtain sufficient information to proceed with the issue/ prepare the prospectus. Alternative: draft lots of questions.

Helps to provide material for the prospectus. Obtaining the comfort letters in agreed form from the issuer’s auditors is also part of the due diligence process

## Documentation

If the bond issue is to be listed, a draft of the prospectus or listing particulars must be sent to the appropriate listing authority. The UKLA usually requires a period of at least 10 working days in which to review a prospectus prior to its intended publication (or 20 working days if the issuer has not previously admitted securities to trading or made a public offer).

- Prospectus.
- Subscription agreement.
- Agreement among managers.
- Fiscal agency agreement and deed of covenant.*
- Trust deed and paying agency agreement.*
- Global note.
- Legal opinion.
- Signing and closing memorandum.

## Marketing

Lead manager helps the issuer's directors in roadshows to potential investors. Check roadshow material to ensure it complies with ss 21 and 25 of the FSMA 2000.

> [!note]
> Sections 21–25 of the FSMA 2000 make it an offence for any person other than an ‘authorised person’ (ie, authorised to carry on regulated activity under the FSMA 2000) to ‘in the course of business, communicate an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity’ (or to cause the same) in the UK, unless its contents have been approved by an authorised person (or an exemption applies).

## Launch and Syndication

Launch date confirmed by formal public announcement. Launch must await completion of due diligence/ marketing. On launch, the issue is announced to the market and the lead manager sends an initial syndicate communication to financial institutions chosen to be invited into the syndicate. Invitation shows the price of the bonds and fees/ commissions to syndicate bank. Co-managers required to respond to the invitation within 24 hours of receipt. Acceptance does not constitute a binding contract to subscribe: that is the purpose of the subscription agreement – moral obligation.

The invitation telex usually includes the following:

- **Terms.** Proposed terms of the bond issue.
- **Selling restrictions.** Any relevant selling restrictions that apply to the issue.
- **Fees.** The fees of the managers.
- **Agreement among managers.** Which version of the two industry-standard agreements among managers is to be used.

Once all the co-managers have responded, the lead manager will know the level of interest in the issue, and can notify each co-manager of the number of bonds it is expected to take at issue by way of a confirmation of allotment. Once the confirmation of allotment has been sent, the draft subscription agreement is sent to each co-manager.

## Listing

A listed bond is one which is formally quoted, listed or capable of being traded on a recognised stock exchange.

Reasons:

- To demonstrate that a bond has satisfied the requirements of the exchange - attaining listed status makes a bond more marketable.
- Some entities are precluded from investing in securities which are not listed.
- One specific advantage of obtaining a London listing of bonds is the ‘quoted bond exemption’ from UK withholding tax. This exemption allows a UK issuer to pay gross interest on both bearer and registered bonds.

Disadvantages:

- Cost
	- Listing authorities charge a fee
	- Lead manager fees and legal fees higher
- Timing
	- Longer timetable UKLA needs time to review documentation & more DD

### Listing Requirements

See Listing Rule 2. The Stock Exchange reserves the right to impose any special condition it considers appropriate in the interests of protecting investors. These include:

- Status
	- Issuer duly incorporated and operating in conformity with constitution.
- Securities
	- Conditions:
		- Conform to law of issuer's place of incorporation, etc.
		- Freely transferrable
		- Expected aggregate market value of at least £200,000
		- Entire class of a security must be listed
		- Convertible securities must convert into securities themselves listed.

### Application Procedure

LR 3, LR 17, PRR 3.

#### 10 Clear Business Day Documents

Issuers (through their sponsor) must submit two copies of specified documents to the UKLA at least 10 clear business days prior to their intended publication (see PRR 3.1.6).

For a bond issue, these documents are:

- Requisite application form
- Prospectus (annotated to indicate compliance)
- 2 letters (non-applicable letter and omission of information letter) explaining why some information does not appear).

#### Marked-up Documents

Any 10-day documents which the UKLA amends (or which are altered after submission to the UKLA) must be re-submitted with the changes marked up.

#### 48-hour Documents

Listing Rule 3.4.4 requires the following documents, in final form, to be submitted at least two business days prior to the consideration of the listing application:

1. a complete application for admission of the securities, and
2. either:
	1. the approved prospectus or listing particulars; or
	2. a copy of a prospectus approved by another Member State (under the ‘passporting’ regime).

#### Listing Charge

On the day of consideration of the listing application, the issuer must pay the appropriate listing fee (Listing Rule 3.2.2).

There are also continuing obligations.

## Signing

Usually within 2 weeks of the issue being launched. Lead manager and solicitors must be sure that aspects of the issue process have been completed before signing.

Lead manager's solicitors should ensure:

- Prospectus is in agreed form
- Other contractual documents completed
- Resolutions necesssary to authorise issue executed
- Common depository appointed.

## Closing

Takes place ~1 week after signing. Issuer receives funds and bonds come into being. Lead manager's solicitors will produce an agenda to ensure necessary matters completed.

### Documentary Procedures

Lead manager's solicitor to complete before closing;

- Admission to listing
- CPs to subscription agreement satisfied
- Auditors' closing comfort letter and issuer's closing certificate
- Legal opinions

By the end of completion, execute:

- Trust deed
- Fiscal agency agreement/ paying agency agreement
- Auditors' closing comfort letter
- Legal opinions
- Issuer's closing certificate
- Payment instructions from lead manager
- Temporary global note
- Permanent global note, if any
- Receipts between issuer and lead manager.

Temporary global note authenticated by the fiscal agent to give it legal effect and delivered to the depository for safe-keeping.

After closing, any documents still to be lodged with UKLA must be sent to the listing agent.

### Payment Procedures

Closing mechanics/ payment against delivery procedures involved in most transactions.

#### Prior to Closing

The lead manager will have notified the clearing system of the names and amounts of bonds to be allotted to the account of each syndicate member. Each syndicate member will also give payment instructions to the clearing system to the effect that its cash account is to be debited.

The instructions are phrased so that the debit will be made only if the syndicate member is credited with the requisite number of bonds in its securities account (payment against delivery).

The lead manager will also instruct the clearing system to debit its new issues account with the total amount of the issue to be paid to the account of the common depository.

#### At Closing

The lead manager will authorise release of its payment instruction to the depository to transfer the money (already placed with the depository) representing the issue amount to the issuer. The depository will transfer the money to the issuer's bank account upon receiving the temporary global note.

The closing is now complete: the issuer has its funds and the depository holds the temporary global note on behalf of the clearing system. The clearing system will have credited the securities accounts of each syndicate member.

### Payment Against Delivery
