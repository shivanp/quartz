# Debentures

The document creating multiple security interests (e.g. charges, mortgages, assignments) for a secured loan is commonly known as a ‘debenture’.

## Structure

- Most banks have their own short standard form security agreement.
- More sophisticated secured loans require a bespoke debenture drafted by the bank's solicitor.
- The broad structure of most debentures is similar to other commercial documents, ie: date, title and parties; preamble; definitions; operative provisions; schedules; and execution.

Operative provisions:

### Covenant to Pay

- Acknowledges the debt obligation of the borrower to the bank, and may refer to a specific debt obligation/ to all the debts between the bank and borrower (“all monies” clause).
- Purposes:
	1. Brings the document within the common law definition of debenture – ‘a document which either creates a debt or acknowledges it’ ([[Levy v Abercorris Slate and Slab Co (1887) 37 Ch D 260]]). Satisfies one of the conditions to appointing an administrative receiver under s 29(2) IA 1986.
	2. In a syndicated loan, the covenant to pay is addressed to the security trustee (“Security Agent”). Allows the security trustee to demand repayment and enforce security on behalf of the syndicate members.
- “On demand” intended to prevent Limitation Act 1939 from acting against the bank until it makes a demand.
	- It does not alter the payment obligation in a facility agreement which it secures.
	- Some debentures refer to monies owing or incurred ‘on any account whatsoever’, but this wording may be inadvisable because there is a danger that it would not include certain types of obligation ([[Re Quest Cae Limited [1985] BCLC 266]])

### Charging Clause

Specifies which of the borrower's assets are charged to repay the debts acknowledged in the covenant to pay, as well as how each type of asset is secured.

#### Land

- A debenture will usually secure leasehold and freehold land by way of a ‘charge by way of legal mortgage’.
- Details of registered land to be secured included in a schedule to the debenture so the security can be registered at the Land Registry.
- Check the terms of any leases to ensure they do not prohibit granting of security interest.
- Future acquired land cannot be secured by legal mortgage, and is therefore secured by a separate equitable mortgage or charge over the property as soon as it is acquired.
	- The borrower may then be required subsequently to ‘upgrade’ this to a legal mortgage.

#### Fixed Plant and Machinery

- A mortgage of land will automatically secure any assets which are, or become, permanently fixed to the secured property (known as ‘fixtures’).
- May be other assets which are not fixtures but are fixed assets.

#### Cash Deposits

 A bank may want to take security over a cash deposit made with it (e.g., if it has provided a performance guarantee).

##### Mortgage/ Charge

 The obvious way to secure the account is for the depositor to create a mortgage or charge over it in favour of the bank. But in [[Re Charge Card Services [1987] Ch 150]],

> [a debt] … cannot be made the subject of a legal or equitable mortgage in favour of the debtor, since this requires a conveyance or assignment by way of security, and this operates as a conditional release;

and

> A charge in favour of a debtor of his own indebtedness to the chargor is conceptually impossible.

```ad-note
title: Logic
- An account is a debt owed by a bank to a depositor. 
- A debt is a right to sue the debtor for the amount owed. 
- If this was charged/ mortgaged in favour of the debt, this would give the debtor the right to sue itself. 
- So this would cancel/ reduce the debt. 
```

In [[Morris v Agrichemicals Ltd [1997] 3 WLR 909]] (‘BCCI No 8’), the House of Lords, led by Lord Hoffmann, declared that a **charge** in favour of a person over the benefit of a deposit made with that person, by another, is not a conceptual impossibility. But an assignment (mortgage) of the account to the bank remains ineffective.

```ad-question
How shold a depositor provide a bank with security ("cash collateral") over a deposit with that bank?
```

The means of enforcing a cash collateral arrangement should be by set-off – contractual set-off prior to winding-up, and mandatory set-off after winding-up. Any security granted over the account is intended to ensure that the money is in the account when the bank needs to set off. So the bank should require:

1. An express contractual right of set-off;
2. a fixed charge over the account (assuming the depositor will not be allowed to withdraw any money without the bank’s prior consent);
3. a prohibition on the depositor assigning the account (to deal with the fact that a bona fide purchaser, for value, without notice could defeat the fixed charge); and
4. if the depositor’s obligation is contingent, a ‘flawed asset’ arrangement (that is, the deposit only becomes repayable at the same time that the depositor’s debt becomes due and unpaid). This protects the account from a liquidator until the bank can exercise its rights of set-off.

```ad-note
- An assignment (mortgage) will usually be possible if security over an account is given to a security trustee or an agent bank on behalf of a syndicate
- None of these issues will apply if a borrower gives security over an account held with a third party bank.
```

#### Goodwill

Any goodwill held by a borrower is probably automatically secured as an inseparable part of the borrower’s secured ‘undertaking’. But usually the debenture explicitly secures the borrower's goodwill by fixed charge.

#### Book Debts

Book debt is an unpaid invoice, i.e., a sum owed to the company in respect of goods or services supplied by it.

Book debts (or “receivables”) are a fluctuating asset, and may be a significant asset of the company.

In early cases, the courts took the approach that a charge granted over book debts was a fixed charge, but this approach has now been overruled.

Case | Authority
---|---
[[Siebe Gorman and Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd [1979] 2 Lloyd's Rep 142]] | The court held that a charge over book debts was a fixed charge because of the degree of control of the bank which could stop the company making withdrawals, even when the account was in credit. Since overruled.
[[Re Brightlife Ltd [1987] Ch 200 ChD]] | The court in this case clarified that a company's bank balance is not a book debt and therefore cannot be subject to a fixed charge.
[[Re Keenan Bros Ltd [1986] BCLC 242]] | A fixed charge was created by the means of a requirement that the funds collected by the company were to be paid into a blocked account. The prior written consent of the bank was required before any funds were allowed to be withdrawn from this account. Here the court said that the charge was a fixed charge due to the fact that the account was blocked.
[[Re Brumark Investments Ltd [2001] ]] | The company's freedom to collect and use the proceeds of the book debts as it wished without requiring the lender's consent was inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge. This was a Privy Council case, which means that it is persuasive but not binding.

Most cases suggest that **book debts have two elements, the debt and the proceeds of the debt**, and that a bank must show control over both elements to achieve fixed security over either. Taking control over the debt element is usually uncontroversial: the bank must prevent the borrower doing anything other than collecting in the debt. Controlling the proceeds is more difficult, because the borrower usually needs access to them to run its business.

In the early 1990s there was a run of judgments which moved against the previous cases and was much more in favour of the banks. The leading case was [[Re New Bullas Trading [1994] 1 BCLC 485]], where the Court of Appeal blessed a debenture allowing fixed security over the unrealised debt and floating security over the proceeds. But this was subject to lots of criticism.

Eventually, the position was resolved in [[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41]]. It is now very difficult to demonstrate the requisite level of control over book debts for a fixed charge. It would require at least a blocked account.

```ad-important
title: Charge over book debts

From the case of [[National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited and others [2005] UKHL 41]] it is only possible to have a fixed charge over book debts if they are paid into a blocked account which gives the lender the degree of control required.

**Book debts can only be secured by a fixed charge where the charge holder has control over both the debts and the proceeds once they were paid.**
```

The vexed question for practitioners, still unanswered by the courts, is how much control (if any) may be given to the borrower without fixed security being lost.

The court will look at the substance of an arrangement, not the title.

#### Shares

Shares may be in

- Registered form (in which a register of legal owners is maintained by the company),
- Bearer form (where legal ownership is generally determined by possession of the share certificate) or
- ‘Dematerialised’ (where they are held and traded electronically).

Registered shares usually secured by either:

1. Creating a legal mortgage by transferring the shares into the bank’s name and issuing a new share certificate to that effect.
	- Rare – lots of admin and potential liabilities for the bank.
	- [[Enviroco Ltd v Farstad Supply A/S [2009] EWCA Civ 1399]]: a company ceases to be a subsidiary of its holding company if the holding company gives a legal mortgage over the subsidiary’s shares.
	- The debenture will allow the bank to sell the shares on default of the borrower and provide for re-transfer when the loan is repaid.
2. Creating an equitable mortgage (or charge) by taking custody of the share certificate together with a stock transfer form executed by the borrower, but with the transferee’s name and other details left blank.
	- The security document should also contain a power of attorney allowing the bank to complete the stock transfer form and submit it, with the share certificates, to register a new owner.
	- The bank does not have the ‘inconvenience’ of ownership pre-enforcement (e.g., voting, passing dividend back to the borrower) and does not run the risk of the company whose shares are secured becoming a subsidiary of the bank.

The bank’s solicitor should ensure:

- that the shares are fully paid up,
- that (for (1)) any stamp duty payable on the transfer form has been paid, and
- that there are no restrictions on transfer in the articles (e.g., pre-emption rights).

In the case of bearer shares, security is usually achieved simply by taking delivery of the share certificate and a memorandum of deposit (i.e., a pledge).

#### Stock in Trade and Sundry Assets

A borrower’s stock, sometimes known as ‘inventory’, is by definition an asset the borrower needs to sell and so will typically be secured by a floating charge.

#### Contracts

Contractual rights are choses in action and so may be secured by way of assignment (legal or equitable) or a charge. Which of these security devices is used will depend on a number of factors, including whether:

- the contract is specified as ‘non-transferable’;
- the borrower needs to alter the contract from time to time;
- it is preferable for the borrower to enforce the contact rights;
 - all or only part of the contract is to be secured;
 - the counterparty can be notified; and
 - the contract has specific features (e.g. an insurance contract).

### Further Assurance Clause

```ad-defn
title: Further assurance
An undertaking by the borrower to do anything necessary in order to perfect the security.
```

May include execution of documents, conversion of an equitable to legal mortgage, deposit of documents of title or provision of additional security.

### Undertakings

Most debentures contain undertakings. The most common are:

- A negative pledge
	- Often included even if the facility agreement contains a negative pledge to help ensure registration at Companies House.
- Undertaking to execute, at the bank’s request, a legal mortgage in place of an equitable one;
- an undertaking to provide the bank with any documents of title it might request;
- an undertaking to repair and maintain land, and insure all assets, together with a power of attorney allowing the bank to do these things (and recover any expenses it incurs) if the borrower does not.

### Crystallisation Clause

If it creates a floating charge, the debenture will specify when the floating charge crystallises. Usually:

1. At any time, the bank notifies the borrower in writing (though the borrower may resist this and insist on default/ perceived risk)
2. Automatically on specified events (e.g., any demand for repayment, on a petition for winding-up etc.)

### Enforcement

The bank will have a right (subject to contrary agreement) to immediate possession of any assets over which it has a legal mortgage, but not those over which it has an equitable mortgage/ charge.

The debenture should therefore give the bank

- an express contractual right to take possession of the charged assets on specified ‘enforcement events’ (i.e., events of default).
- enhanced powers to sell, lease and appropriate secured assets on enforcement.
- the right, on an enforcement event, to appoint a receiver of the secured property, an administrator and, if permitted, an administrative receiver. Such appointees will be extended any enhanced rights given to the bank.

### Collection of Debts

A debenture will usually require the borrower to collect in any debts and claims of the business ‘promptly’, and to pay them into specified accounts.

### Power of Attorney

A debenture will invariably provide the bank and any receiver it appoints with a power of attorney.

- This will allow the bank to carry out any of the borrower’s obligations under the debenture which the borrower fails to honour.
- Also assists in enforcement of security.
- The instrument creating a power of attorney must be executed as a deed and, provided it is given to secure a proprietary interest of the donee and also expressed to be ‘irrevocable’, it will survive the borrower’s liquidation (Powers of Attorney Act 1971, s 4).

### Redemption of Security

The debenture must provide for the release of the security once the secured obligations are satisfied.

The debenture may allow the bank, if it believes a preference (or similar) claim is possible, to deem the debt and related security to ‘continue’ even after repayment. Unproven and probably not workable.

There are no strict formalities for the discharge of security, other than for registered land.

### Administrative Provisions

A debenture will contain a number of boilerplate clauses concerning administrative matters, such as notice periods, interpretation, service of documents, and costs and expenses.

## Execution

Debentures should be made by deed:

1. it avoids any doubt as to sufficiency of consideration;
2. it is necessary because debentures invariably create a power of attorney (see the Power of Attorney Act 1971, s 1);
3. it is necessary if a debenture conveys or creates a legal estate in land (LPA 1925, s 52); and
4. it is necessary if the bank is to take powers under LPA 1925, s 101 (powers of mortgagees to sell mortgaged property/ enter into contracts etc.).

A debenture should also be expressed as being made by the borrower ‘in favour of the bank’ (rather than ‘between’ borrower and bank) to ensure that it can be enforced by a party other than the bank (e.g., a receiver or attorney).
