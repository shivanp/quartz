# Legal Opinions

First introduced in US, now usual for UK banks making substantial loans or capital market investments.

## Fundamentals

### Purpose

Relate only to matters of law. In banking, a legal opinion will usually confirm that all the documents associated with the loan are legally valid and enforceable and highlight areas of risk.

### Who

Typically provided by the bank's solicitor, addressed to the bank. Generally, only an addressee may sue the solicitor if the opinion proves wrong, although the solicitor will owe a general responsibility to anyone they know has relied on their advice. If the transaction involves a syndicate (or underwriters), the opinion may be addressed to the agent bank on their behalf, or be addressed to each of them individually.

### When

Almost always required for:

| Scenario               | Details                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large loans            | Opinion by the bank's lawyers that the documents are legal, valid and binding.                 |
| Secured lending        | Statement confirming the priority and enforceability of the security and to outline any risks. |
| Overseas jurisdictions | Legal opinion required by a local lawyer.                                                                                                |

- Even if the loan is a repeat of an earlier one (a re-financing), the bank may still require a new opinion (to update effect).
- A bank will usually make the delivery of a satisfactory legal opinion a condition precedent to the loan being drawn down.
	- A borrower ideally should insist that the bank and the opining solicitors agree the form of the opinion in advance of executing the facility agreement.

### Form

Written as a letter on the solicitor's headed notepaper, addressed to the bank and signed in the firm's name.

Structure:

1. Preamble;
2. assumptions;
3. opinion; and
4. qualifications.

## Preamble

- Outlines form of loan transaction
- Lists all the documents in respect of which the opinion is given
- Lists specific documents which the solicitor has reviewed in order to give the opinion.
- Usually delivered after the documents to which it refers have been executed – if not be clear that it refers to a particular draft.
- Record of any searches on which the opinion relies and the date on which they were done.

## Assumptions

- All signatures appearing on reviewed documents are genuine
- Documents submitted to the solicitors as originals are authentic and complete
- All copies complete and accurate.
- Any resolutions properly passed at quorate meetings duly held
- Documents accurate
- Draft documents executed unchanged
- Searches remain unchanged
- No insolvencies since the opinion
- No foreign law affects the conclusion
- That the bank had no notice of any prohibition or restriction on creating the security, or notice of any other security in the same assets;
- that immediately after providing any guarantee (or other security), each obligor was fully solvent, and that the provision of the guarantee (or security) was in good faith, for the benefit of the obligor and did not constitute financial assistance.

## Opinion

- Actual opinion appears in the form of numbered statements.
- Short compared to the overall length of the letter.
- The exact form of legal opinion will be negotiated between bank and solicitor.

Commonly includes:

- That borrower was properly incorporated and not in liquidation.
- Borrower has requisite power to enter into and perform the facility agreement, and has taken action necessary to authorise execution.
- Execution, delivery and performance will not contravene English law or regulation, and will not violate memorandum/ articles.
- Payments made by the borrower not subject to UK taxes and no taxes payable on execution/ registration of facility agreement.
- All necessary registration, filings, licences and consents have been obtained in order to validate the loan document.

## Qualifications

Commonly:

- The validity, performance and enforcement of the facility agreement may be affected by insolvency proceedings.
- Any declaration in the opinion that the facility agreement is enforceable must be read on the basis that equitable remedies are at the discretion of the court
- A provision purporting to create a fixed charge may be construed as creating a floating charge
- The enforcement of some security rights is controlled by law.
- Any claims under the loan may be affected by lapse of time.
- The opinion can only take account of the law of England and Wales.
- A court may refuse to entertain proceedings if a claim has been, or is being, brought elsewhere.
- Certain specific provisions may not be upheld by a court, most notably default interest, provisions for severability, and provisions requiring a borrower to pay the costs of litigation on enforcement.

## Foreign Counsel Legal Opinions

If the facility agreement is governed by English law but a borrower (or guarantor) is incorporated outside of England and Wales, the banks will usually require a legal opinion from counsel in that jurisdiction.

This should cover:

- Borrower's status (duly incorporated etc.)
- Borrower has power and authority to execute transaction and perform obligations
- No legal conflict (with law or constitution of the borrower).
- Legal, valid, binding and enforceable
- Filings, registrations and consent – confirmation that no further action is needed (e.g., executing in front of a notary, which is common under civil law).
- Withholding tax – lenders sensitive to withholding tax being imposed.
- Domicile – confirmation that the lenders will not become domiciled in the local jurisdiction by virtue of the transaction documentation.
- Choice of law – confirmation that it will be recognised.
- Lender's claim to rank *pari passu* (at least)
- Jurisdiction and agent for service of process.
	- Confirmation that the borrower’s submission to jurisdiction is valid and cannot be revoked.
	- Confirmation that the appointment of an agent in the jurisdiction of the governing law (an ‘agent for service of process’) is valid and cannot be revoked.
- Validity of security and that it covers future as well current advances.

Other issues:

- No limitation on paying interest
- No exchange control
- Borrower solvent
- Borrower cannot claim immunity to proceedings.
- Whether there are any restrictions on providing guarantees and security.
- Whether there are issues with financial assistances.

## Reference in Facility Agreement

> [!warning]
> The legal opinion is likely to be referred to in the “Representations” section of the facility agreement and is likely to be listed as a “Condition Precedent” in the facility agreement.
