# Quasi-Security

There are various ways a bank might choose to enhance its prospects of repayment, which are not strictly security interests because they are not “rights in rem”.

## Guarantees and Comfort Letters

```ad-defn
title: Obligors
The borrower, together with any third parties willing to support the borrower's repayment obligations. 
```

Guarantors are also known as sureties.

### Guarantees

- A guarantee is a form of undertaking by one party to answer for another party's liabilities, usually on default.
- A guarantor will frequently be a company in the same group as the borrower.
- The company which has given the guarantee may be required to give security over its own assets.
- A parent company usually also guarantees punctual performance of the borrower's obligations.

### Guarantees Vs Indemnities

A guarantee creates a contractual ‘secondary’ obligation, which relies on there being a valid primary obligation between two parties other than the guarantor. The guarantor's obligation is contingent on the primary obligation. It will therefore never be greater than that of the obligor under the underlying agreement.

An indemnity creates an obligation to indemnify a party for a specified loss which it may incur. Unlike a guarantee, an indemnity creates a ‘stand alone’ (or primary) obligation which is independent of the liability or default of another party. It is independent of, and not contingent on, the obligations of the primary obligor. This means that, if the underlying transaction is set aside for any reason, the indemnity will remain valid.

It is possible for both a guarantee and an indemnity to be given at the same time. For the lender, it is essential that a guarantee of a loan is supported by an indemnity if the lender is to be properly protected.

```ad-action
When including both an indemnity and a guarantee in the same document, it is very important to spell out the terms of the obligations, as the onus will be on the lender to prove that the document is both a primary and secondary obligation. The title of the document will not determine whether it is a guarantee or an indemnity, or both, and neither will the practice of referring to a guarantor and indemnifier simply as a guarantor, even though this is widespread.
```

Assume that A has borrowed money from B, and so A owes a contractual obligation to repay that money to B.

> A guarantee is a promise by a party to ensure that another party carries out its obligations, or a promise to fulfil those obligations itself if the other party does not do so.

> An indemnity is a promise to reimburse someone in the event that they suffer a stated loss.

Suppose C indemnifies B against non-repayment of the loan to A. Then C's obligation is a primary obligation, so C's liability might ultimately be even more than A's was. Provides greater protection for B: it can look to either A or C for payment.

### Indemnity Advantages

- Primary obligation is more robust than a secondary obligation since it is not dependent on the underlying obligation.
- Guarantee requires formalities (in writing and signed by the guarantor or a person authorised by it)
- Guarantees vulnerable if any changes made to the underlying obligation.
	- _[Holme v Brunskill (1878) 3 QBD 495](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC2F31920E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html)_ established the rule that any amendments of the primary underlying contract, after the giving of the guarantee, will discharge the guarantor's liability under the guarantee unless either:
		- The guarantor consents to the variation.
		- The variation is patently insubstantial or incapable of adversely affecting the guarantor.
	- Above rule does not apply to indemnities (_[GPP Big Field LLP v Solar EPC Solutions SL [2018] EWHC 2866 (Comm)](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-102-7705?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&comp=pluk)_)

### Practical Implications

- Substance not form is important
- If A's obligations cease, then if C has provided a guarantee, C's obligation under the guarantee will also cease, because it is dependent on A's obligation
- If C provides an indemnity, this would remain in place.
- If there is a change to the contract between A and B after the guarantee/ indemnity is given, then a guarantee would almost always be discharged, but an indemnity would remain in force.
- To execute a guarantee, it must be in writing and signed by the guarantor. Not necessary for an indemnity.

### Legal Implications

1. Since the guarantee creates a ‘secondary’ obligation, the guarantor will not be liable unless the borrower’s debt becomes due.
	1. Most banks will therefore require that the ‘guarantee’ is ‘on demand’ and payable as if a ‘principal debt’
	2. So once the borrower defaults, the bank can immediately demand performance from the guarantor ([[McGuinness v Norwich and Peterborough Building Society [2010] EWHC 2989 (Ch)]]).
2. If the contract between bank and borrower (the primary contract) is void (or if the borrower’s obligation is discharged), the guarantor’s obligation will fall away.
	1. A bank will therefore usually include a provision that the guarantee survives failure of the underlying obligation
	2. Also an indemnity within the guarantee document in order to create a primary obligation on the ‘guarantor’ if the guarantee fails.
3. If the contract between bank and borrower is varied in any material way without the guarantor’s consent, the guarantor is released from the guarantee (even if the variation was not prejudicial to the guarantor).
	1. Similarly, certain acts which might be prejudicial to the guarantor (e.g., if the bank fails to register security for the debt) will void the guarantee.
	2. [[Triodos Bank v Ashley Charles Dobbs [2005] EWCA Civ 630]]: the court decided that in respect of a guarantee purporting to allow “any amendments, variation, waiver or release from an obligation”, any amendment or variation must be ‘within the general purview of the original guarantee’.
	3. In [[Maxted, Lorimer v Investec Bank PLC [2017] EWHC 1997 (Ch)]], the High Court held that amendments to a loan (including an increase in amount and extension of the term) were within the purview of guarantees given by the borrowing company’s directors.
	4. The judge in [[Maxted, Lorimer v Investec Bank PLC [2017] EWHC 1997 (Ch)]] confirmed that if facility amendments were beyond the purview of the guarantees, this could be cured by the guarantors consenting to them (so the bank will ask guarantors to do this).

Other rights – usually waived or postponed:

1. Once a guaranteed debt has crystallised, the guarantor can make payment and claim indemnity from the obligor without waiting for a demand for payment of the debt. This is the case even if the guarantee requires payment only on demand (_[Thomas v Nottingham Incorporated Football Club Ltd [1972] Ch 596](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-5038?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=9fc18fbc2d79468f9bd5272f7e22e9db)_).
2. A guarantor may use most rights of set-off or counterclaim which the borrower has against the bank to reduce its liability under guarantee.
	1. Where the underlying obligor's payment obligations are satisfied by way of set-off against the creditor's corresponding liabilities, the guarantor is entitled to that right of set-off and will therefore be discharged from its obligations (_[BOC Group plc v Centeon LLC [1999] 1 All ER (Comm) 53](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-4199?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=9fc18fbc2d79468f9bd5272f7e22e9db)_).
3. Once paid out under the guarantee, a guarantor will be entitled to reimbursement from the borrower.
	1. There is an implied contract between the guarantor and the obligor that the obligor will provide such an indemnity (_[Re a Debtor (No.627 of 1936) [1937] Ch 156](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-5037?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=31b1b10b11a346b28acbfa5d800fec19)_).
4. Guarantor entitled to any security the bank holds for the borrower’s debt, under the doctrine of **subrogation** (equitable remedy to prevent unjust enrichment).
	1. Subrogation arises only once a guarantor has paid the full amount for which it is liable under the guarantee.
	2. Subrogation allows the guarantor to assume all the rights the lender has in relation to the borrower under the underlying contract.
	3. Once the guarantor has repaid the beneficiary, it is entitled to step into the shoes of the beneficiary and take the benefit of any rights of set-off and any security that the beneficiary has taken from the underlying obligor (_[Craythorne v Swinburne (1807) 14 Ves 160](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-5042?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=9fc18fbc2d79468f9bd5272f7e22e9db)_).
5. If there is more than one guarantor of the debt, any guarantor that pays out will have a right to claim back a share of the payment from co-guarantors (“right of contribution”).

The guarantee document should postpone the rights until such time as the bank has been repaid in full and no longer requires the security. It will also want any obligation of contribution to be waived in respect of any subsidiary it wants to sell.

### Drafting guarantee/ Indemnity

- If there is any uncertainty, the courts will presume that the interpretation that is less onerous for the giver of the document is correct.
- When distinguishing between indemnities and guarantees, the courts have traditionally looked at the extent to which the promisor is connected with the underlying transaction.
- A promisor unconnected with the underlying transaction, except by means of a promise to pay, has been held to be a guarantor, while a promise made by someone who will derive some benefit from the transaction was an indemnity (_[Couturier v Hastie (1852) 8 Exch 40](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-4146?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=31b1b10b11a346b28acbfa5d800fec19)_).
- The courts also consider the extent to which the promise can be construed as being the main purpose of the transaction (a guarantee) or incidental to the main purpose of the transaction (an indemnity) (_[Harburg India Rubber Comb Co v Martin [1902] 1 KB 778](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-5044?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=31b1b10b11a346b28acbfa5d800fec19)_).
- Identifying a guarantee involves making a distinction between the promisor having a mere motive for making the promise and having a “real interest” in (that is, deriving actual benefit from) the underlying transaction (_[Pitts v Jones [2007] EWCA Civ 1301](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-2980?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=31b1b10b11a346b28acbfa5d800fec19)_).

```ad-defn
title: Principle of co-extensiveness
The key feature of a guarantee that a guarantor is only liable to the beneficiary to the same extent as the underlying obligor.
```

#### Principle Debtor

A so-called principal debtor clause states, broadly, that a guarantor will be liable to the lender as if it were the principal obligor. This allows the lender to treat the guarantor as a debtor in certain circumstances.

The generally accepted view is that a principal debtor clause is unlikely to convert a guarantee into an indemnity (_[Carey Value Added, S.L. v Group Urvasco, S.A. [2010] EWHC 1905](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-1341?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=31b1b10b11a346b28acbfa5d800fec19)_). If the beneficiary wants an indemnity, it should expressly include one.

### General Considerations

- Governing law of the guarantee should if possible mirror that of the other loan documents.
- If the contract is legally a guarantee, it must be evidenced in writing before it can be enforced (Statute of Frauds 1677, s 4).
- As a contract, a guarantee is enforceable only if it is given for **consideration** (potentially void for past consideration if it is pre-dated by the obligation). So create as deed.
	- If a guarantee is executed as a deed, the guarantor will be bound from the date on which the deed is delivered.
- A guarantee should be expressed as ‘continuing’ to avoid the rule in ‘Clayton’s case’ and to help it to survive variations to the primary obligation.
	- Generally, receipts from the borrower into an account will discharge the liabilities in the order in which they were incurred, according to the rule in _[Devaynes v Noble, Clayton's case (1816) 1 Mer 529](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-000-4111?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=%28sc.Default%29&comp=pluk)_.
	- In the context of continuing guarantees, it is not necessary under English law to state whether the guarantor can revoke its obligations under the guarantee.
- The guarantee should provide that the bank’s evidence of the borrower’s liability is conclusive.
- As with any other contract, a company must have the requisite power to enter into a guarantee, and its officers must be properly authorised.
	- Consider **s 172** duty to promote the success of the company.
	- The higher the risk that a company is assuming by entering into a contract, the greater the commercial benefit (sometimes called “corporate benefit”) obtained from the contract needs to be.
		- It is assumed that, if a parent company guarantees or indemnifies the obligations of a subsidiary (a “downstream” guarantee), there is sufficient commercial benefit because of the increased profitability of the subsidiary, higher dividends and increased value of the shares.
		- If a subsidiary guarantees or indemnifies the obligations of a parent company (an “upstream” guarantee), this is more difficult.
			- Subsidiaries often rely on parent companies for treasury services, which can justify an upstream guarantee.
			- The guarantee or indemnity provided by each subsidiary helps reduce the funding costs for the group as a whole.
- A guarantee is capable of being ‘financial assistance’ under the provisions of CA 2006, ss 678–680.
	- It is unlawful for a public company whose shares are being, or have been, acquired (or for any of that company's subsidiaries) to give financial assistance directly or indirectly for the purpose of that acquisition unless certain exceptions apply.
	- The term “financial assistance” includes the provision of guarantees, security or indemnities and any form of assistance whereby the net assets of the assisting company are reduced to a material extent or where the assisting company has no net assets.
	- Penalties include the guarantee/ indemnity being void, and directors being liable for a fine and $\leq 2$ years imprisonment.

```ad-test
title: Rule in Clayton's case

Technically, the rule applying to withdrawals from a current bank account is the rule in [[Clayton’s Case (1816) 1 Mer 529]]. Grant MR stated: ‘it is the sum first paid in that is first drawn out.’ The rule is commonly described as ‘the first in, first out’ rule.
```

```ad-example
T misapplies £1,000 of trust fund A and pays it into a current bank account (‘the account’). T misapplies £1,000 of trust fund B and pays it into the account. T withdraws £1,000 from the account and uses it to purchase shares. T misapplies £1,000 of trust fund C and pays it into the account. T withdraws £1,000 from the account and dissipates it. £1,000 is still credited to the account.
```

```ad-important
title: Illegality
Azimut-Bennetti v Healay – if the underlying obligation was void for public policy (e.g. as a penalty), then the guarantee will also be void for reasons of public policy and there is nothing that the guarantee can say to change it.
```

### Insolvency Act 1986

A guarantee is arguably capable of being a transaction at an undervalue (because, unlike a borrower granting security, it usually increases the guarantor’s liabilities) and, in limited circumstances (e.g., where the guarantor had previously only given third party security, with no guarantee), a preference, and so being set aside under IA 1986, ss 238 and 239 respectively.

### Counter-indemnity

There is no case law that says that payment under an indemnity will give rise to the same right to be counter-indemnified as applies in the case of a guarantee, but it seems likely that it does (_[Berghoff Trading Ltd v Swinbrook Developments Ltd [2009] EWCA Civ 413](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-009-8767?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=9fc18fbc2d79468f9bd5272f7e22e9db)_).

However, as an indemnity is not co-extensive with the underlying obligations, the indemnifier may be liable to pay more than the underlying obligor. There would therefore be a question about whether the counter-indemnity would be limited to the amount payable by the underlying obligor. Consequently, it is not unusual, when entering into a combined guarantee and indemnity, to insist that a counter-indemnity agreement between the guarantor and the underlying obligor is also entered into.

## Comfort Letters

Suppose a parent company/ other potential obligor refuses to provide a guarantee. The bank may demand a comfort letter (“support letter”/ “letter of intent”) from the obligor. This could be a written acknowledgement that the subsidiary is undertaking the obligations created by the loan, to a statement of intention to maintain an interest in, and support for, a subsidiary, and to ensure it is capable of fulfilling those obligations ("keep-well agreement").

Not normally intended to be legally binding. Phrasing usually deliberately vague enough not to be enforceable under contract law. Consider offer and acceptance, ICLR and consideration.

In the case of [[Re Atlantic Computers plc (in administration); National Australia Bank Ltd v Soden [1995] BCC 696]], it was held that the common intention of the parties to a comfort letter must be ascertained by reading it as a whole. So include wording like ‘an expression of present intention by way of comfort only’.

## Negative Pledge

Arguably a restriction on how the borrower may use its assets. Technically not a security interest (although it might provide a claim in tort for damages against a third party which induces a borrower to breach the prohibition, and there is an argument that the third party holds any such security on trust for the negative pledge holder).

## Retention of Title

A retention of title clause allows a seller to retain legal title to goods which have been supplied to a buyer until the buyer settles its account. If payment is not forthcoming, the seller can recover the goods from the buyer.

This may undermine a bank's security, so it is common for the bank to require representations and/or warranties to the effect that the borrower is not party to any agreements which contain a retention of title clause.

## Set-off

A right to set a debt owed by a creditor to a debtor against the debtor’s debt, and so reduce or extinguish that debt.

```ad-tip
Basically the right to take money from the borrower's current account if it defaults on its loan. 
```

3 ways in which a bank is likely to have a right of set-off against the borrower:

| Means                      | Details                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equitable right of set-off | A bank may set off a liquidated debt owed to it by a borrower against a liquidated debt owed by it to that borrower.                                    |
| Contractual set-off        | Most security documents supporting a loan will enhance the equitable right of set-off by allowing the bank to set off unliquidated (contingent) claims. |
| Set-off on liquidation     | r 490 Insolvency Rules 1986 provides for mandatory set-off. Basically, any ‘mutual’ credits, debts or dealings can be set off so long as the bank did not know of the petition for insolvency against the borrower when it gave credit. Set off of contingent claims also allowed.                                                                                                                                                         |

```ad-note
The right of set-off is particularly important if a debtor is in danger of becoming insolvent (but no petition has been lodged), since it allows access to the debtor’s unsecured assets (ie, cash) without risk of being a transaction at an undervalue or a preference under IA 1986, ss 238 and 239.
```

### Banker's Right of Combination

There is an implied right under common law which is peculiar to banks and which allows them, subject to contrary agreement, to combine two or more accounts of a borrower. So an overdrawn account and an account in credit can be combined.

## Why Take Security

Aside from increasing the likelihood of getting repaid, there are other reasons for taking security:

### Appointing administrator/ Receiver

If a bank wants to enforce security it will invariably do so through a third party, and usually when the borrower is, or is about to become, insolvent.

#### Administration pre-EA 2002

The administration procedure was introduced by the IA 1986. For an administrator, the first, and key, purpose was to ensure ‘the survival of the company, and the whole or any part of its undertaking, as a going concern’. The administrator was given power to effect a moratorium on the rights of all secured and unsecured creditors, to help further this purpose.

Banks didn't like this, so successfully lobbied for the right to block an administration order if they held security (which included a floating charge) over all, or substantially all, of a company’s assets. This was achieved by appointing an administrative receiver under IA 1986 (s 9).

#### Administrative Receiver pre-EA 2002

```ad-statute
title: s 29(2) IA 1986
“Administrative receiver” means—
- (a) a receiver or manager of the whole (or substantially the whole) of a company’s property appointed by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures of the company secured by a charge which, as created, was a floating charge, or by such a charge and one or more other securities; or
- (b) a person who would be such a receiver or manager but for the appointment of some other person as the receiver of part of the company’s property.
```

The term ‘debenture’ ‘includes … bonds and any other securities of a company …’. So long as a bank held security (which included a floating charge) over ‘all or substantially all’ of a borrower’s assets, it could appoint an administrative receiver, with wide-ranging powers to manage the business and sell assets to repay the bank debt and, crucially, the power to block an administration order and moratorium.

#### Administration post-EA 2002

New purposes of administration (cascading downwards):

1. attempt to rescue the company as a going concern – if this is not reasonably practical, or would not produce the best result for the creditors as a whole;
2. attempt to achieve a better result for creditors than if the company were wound up; and (only if the administrator thinks the first two purposes are not reasonably practical)
3. realise the company’s property to distribute to secured or preferential creditors, so long as the administrator does not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors as a whole.

These apply regardless of who appoints the administrator. Administrator can be appointed:

1. By court order
2. By [[Qualifying Floating Charge]] holder. Floating charge document must state that EA 2002 applies to it/ purport to allow the holder to appoint an administrator or administrative receiver.

#### Administrative Receivership post-EA 2002

In addition to any floating charges created before 15 September 2003, there are eight ‘exceptions’ under which an administrative receiver may still be appointed:

1. ‘capital market’ exception,
2. ‘public–private partnership’ exception,
3. ‘utility projects’ exception,
4. ‘urban regeneration projects’ exception,
5. ‘project finance’ exception,
6. ‘financial markets’ exception,
7. ‘protected railways and other companies’ exception and
8. ‘registered social landlord’ exception.

Applies only to specialist financing.

```ad-summary
Where the bank holds a ‘qualifying floating charge’ created after 15 September 2003, but does not fall within one of the eight statutory exceptions, it will be permitted to appoint an administrator only to realise security on insolvency. The bank’s administrator must consider the two prior purposes of administration before realising assets on the bank’s behalf.

### Peripheral Benefits

- Taking fixed security will help to prevent a borrower disposing of assets and ensure they remain in the business to create value, enhancing disposal undertakings.
- It may deter other banks from lending to the borrower, enhancing the negative pledge.
- It may also dissuade unsecured creditors from taking action to wind up the borrower.
- Personal security from directors of a small company may act as an incentive for them to work to make the business prosper.

### Costs

Secured loans will carry less risk for a bank than unsecured loans, and compliance with regulatory capital requirements will make some types of secured loan ‘cheaper’ than unsecured loans.

## Bank's Perspective

- Taking security is expensive and time-consuming. Investment grade loans are unsecured; highly leveraged loans almost always secured.
- A bank’s solicitor should check that the borrower and any other party providing security has capacity to do so (there may be restrictions in the articles).
- Check there is no existing negative pledge.

## Borrower's Perspective

- Usually liable for all reasonable costs of providing security, including solicitors' fees and registration costs.
- Two concessions frequently negotiated:
	1. In acquisition financings, only share security is provided at closing (when the loan is available). Borrower given a period of time (up to 120 days) to provide remaining asset security.
	2. Common to agree security principles early in negotiation – pre-agreed parameters for security, costs and any obligations on the borrower.
