# Novation, Assignment, Sub-participation

A bank may use loans like fixed assets: purchasing them, keeping them for a while to earn income, and then disposing of them.

## Why Sell a Loan

1. Realising capital
	1. Improve liquidity to take advantage of new/ better lending opportunities.
	2. Focus on a particular market.
2. Risk management
	1. Sell loans to diversify away from one type of loan/ borrower.
3. Balance sheet
	1. Bank must maintain a % of its capital as cover for loans (regulatory capital).
	2. Sell loans to raise capital for others
4. Profit
	1. Short-term profit by selling a loan (e.g., if interest rates fall)
	2. If a borrower has defaulted/ is performing badly, a lender may choose to sell participation at a discount to crystallise loss
5. Prestige
	1. Bank may want initial involvement in a facility which is high-profile/ important, but may sell this after.
6. Syndication
	1. Some loans provide for syndication post-closing.

## Moving Rights and Obligations

- Most contracts operate by giving rights and obligations (liabilities) to each party.
- Under most facility agreements, a bank’s fundamental obligation is to lend money (the borrower has a right to borrow), whilst its fundamental rights are usually to receive interest and eventual return of capital (the borrower is obliged to service and repay the loan).
- In order to fully dispose of a loan, a bank must dispose of both its rights and its obligations.
- Under English law, contractual obligations can be moved only with the consent of the party to whom the obligation is owed (i.e., borrower's consent is required).

## Selling Assets

Methods of disposing of an asset:

1. Novation
2. Legal (“statutory”/ “disclosed”) assignment
3. Equitable (“undisclosed”) assignment
4. Sub-participation
5. Risk participation.

Main aim of the bank: to remove the risk associated with the asset.

### Novation

The only way in which a party can effectively ‘transfer’ all its rights and obligations under a contract is with the consent of all the parties involved.

> [!important]
> Novation involves one party’s rights and obligations under a contract being cancelled and discharged, whilst a third party assumes identical new rights and obligations in their place.

The new bank assumes identical rights and obligations with respect to the borrower as applied to the existing bank.

> [!warning]
> Strictly, a novation does not transfer rights and liabilities: it cancels an existing contract and replaces it with another. The borrower’s promise to perform its obligations in favour of a new bank is consideration for the existing bank releasing the old debt.

#### Advantages

- Moving obligations
	- Only proven method of moving contractual obligations as well as rights.
	- Allows the existing bank to dispose of a loan which has an unutilised commitment (e.g., under an RCF).
	- The new bank achieves a relationship with the borrower as if it were a party to the facility agreement.
- Risk transfer
	- Can fully remove a loan (including undrawn commitments) from the existing bank's balance sheet and exclude it from regulatory capital requirements.
- Easy syndication
	- If the original facility agreement included transfer certificates, the existing bank can take a large commitment without the delay of putting together an underwriting syndicate.

#### Disadvantages

- Consent
	- Consent of all parties involved in the original loan document is required, including any parties which guaranteed the borrower's performance.
	- Puts lots of power in the borrower's hands.
	- Solution: use of transfer certificates
		- Facility agreement will contain a clause under which the parties agree that a bank may dispose by novation any or all of its commitment – open offer to take a loan (though borrower's consent may be required in certain circumstances).
		- Pro-forma certificate usually included as a schedule.
	- Controversy
		- Australian case [[Goodridge v Macquarie Bank Limited [2010] FCA 67]] held that a prior agreement to novation in a loan agreement was invalid and simply an ‘agreement to agree’.
		- [[Habibsons Bank Ltd v Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited [2010] EWCA Civ 1335]]: CoA obiter criticised the decision.
	- A system similar to the transfer certificate is the transferable loan certificate (TLC). The only significant difference is that the TLC operates through the agent bank issuing certificates and keeping a register of transfers.
- Secured loans
	- Novation (probably) restarts hardening periods during which security may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue/ preferred transaction/ avoidance of floating charges.
	- Security being re-dated may lose priority over other security.
		- Solution: appoint a security trustee to hold any security granted under the loan on trust for the banks.
		- Banks participating in the facility from time to time are beneficiaries.
- Disclosure
	- Difficult to hide the identity of a transferee bank.

### Legal Assignment

Assignment is the transfer of **rights**. **s 136 LPA 1925** provides that an assignment of debts and other choses in action will only be recognised at common law if it is:

1. In writing and signed by the assignor;
2. Absolute (i.e., unconditional); and
	- To be ‘absolute’ in the context of loan transfers, an assignment must transfer the whole of the debt owed to the existing bank ([[Walter and Sullivan Ltd v Murphy (J) and Sons Ltd [1955] 2 QB 584]]) (and cannot be ‘by way of charge’)
3. Notified in writing to any person(s) against whom the assignor could enforce the assigned rights.

> [!tip]
> - If any one of the conditions for legal (or "statutory") assignment is not fulfilled, the assignment will be an equitable one.
> - An assignment can transfer only rights, not obligations

#### Advantages

- Rights transferred
	- Rights under a facility agreement transferred without requiring the borrower's consent.
- Borrower's payments
	- On receiving notice of an assignment, the borrower is obliged to pay any monies due under the assigned loan to the new bank.
- Secured loan
	- Any security, or a bank’s rights as beneficiary of any security sharing agreement, may be assigned along with the debt, but is usually held by a Security Trustee or under a parallel debt structure.

#### Disadvantages

- Obligations not transferred
	- Existing bank cannot assign any undrawn commitments (makes assigning a revolving credit facility problematic)
	- Obligations to other syndicate banks not transferred.
	- Some facility documents therefore include assignment mechanics which purport to assign the existing bank’s rights, release the existing bank from any obligations relating to that part of its commitment, and require the new bank to assume equivalent obligations.
- Rights not transferred
	- The rights under a contract can be assigned without consent only in ‘cases where it can make no difference to the person on whom the obligation lies to which of two persons he is to discharge it’ ([[Tolhurst v Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (1900) Ltd [1902] 2 KB 660]]).
	- Objective test – character of the assignee will b ignored.
	- Danger that any indemnity provisions for increased costs may be unassignable without consent because they are personal.

### Equitable Assignment

An assignment which does not meet any of the provisions required for legal assignment under the LPA 1925, s 136 will be an equitable assignment.

Procedurally, an equitable assignee must join the assignor (the existing bank) in any action on the debt ([[Three Rivers DC v Bank of England [1995] 4 All ER 312]]).

#### Advantages

- Partial assignment
	- If a bank wants to assign part of an outstanding loan, it must use an equitable assignment.
- Non-disclosure
	- If a bank wants to assign an outstanding loan without disclosing the identity of the new bank to the borrower, it must use an equitable assignment.

#### Disadvantages

- Payments
	- If the equitable assignment is not notified to the borrower, the borrower is entitled to continue making payments through the existing bank.
		- Old bank might be happy to skim interest
		- New bank taking a double credit risk.
- Subject to equities
	- If the equitable assignment is unnotified, a new bank will be subject to all ‘equities’ (e.g., mutual rights of set-off) which arise between the existing bank and the borrower, until notification of assignment.

#### Form of Notice

A notice of assignment (legal or equitable) should require a borrower to confirm:

1. the amount of the existing bank’s debt;
2. that it has no rights of set-off or counter-claim against the existing bank;
3. that it has no notice of other assignments of the same debt;
4. the facility agreement has not been varied; and
5. that it will pay amounts due and payable under the underlying contract to the new bank’s order.

### Sub-participation

Novation and assignment are attractive to banks because they enable it to remove loans from its balance sheet. Possible to achieve the same effect while leaving the original loan in place: sub-participation (“funded participation”).

> [!defn] Sub-participation
> An arrangement under which an existing bank matches part or all of its loan to a borrower with a deposit it takes from a new bank (the ‘sub-participant’). The new bank agrees that its deposit will be serviced and repaid only when the borrower services and repays the loan from the existing bank. The sub-participant has effectively taken on the risk of the first loan.

- The transaction does not involve any transfer of rights or obligations: the existing bank's contractual relationship with the borrower is unaffected.
- Since sub-participation is an entirely separate agreement, the sub-participant bank has no-recourse against the borrower (“non-recourse transaction”).
- Security provided remains with the existing bank.

#### Advantages

- Risk transfer
	- Sub-participation removes a loan from inclusion in the existing bank's regulatory capital requirements, other than in respect of undrawn commitments.
- Consent
	- Unless there is a prohibition in the original facility agreement, existing bank can sub-participate without the consent of the borrower.
	- All banks owe a duty of confidentiality to clients ([[Tournier v National Provincial and Union Bank of England [1924] 1 KB 461]]).
		- Existing bank intending to sub-participate will want to include a clause in the original facility agreement will want a clause allowing it to release information about the borrower and the loan.
- Non-disclosure
	- Existing bank does not have to disclose sub-participation to the borrower, and most sub-participations will be silent.

#### Disadvantages

- Sub-participant's credit risk
	- Double credit risk for the sub-participation.
- Risk transfer
	- May not off-load the entire risk of undrawn commitments if it just results in the existing bank taking a risk on the new bank instead of the borrower.
	- The sub-participation agreement must ensure that the existing bank is put in funds in time to meet the borrower’s demands for utilisation.

### Risk Participation

- Form of participation which acts like a guarantee.
- Risk participant agrees for a fee to put the existing bank in funds in certain circumstances (e.g., payment default by borrower).
- Common use: to cover "unfunded" assets (guarantees, letters of credit, swaps).
	- If existing bank's customer fails to meet reimbursement obligations, the new bank will put the existing bank in funds.

## Global Transfer Agreement

> [!defn]
> A new contract which amends (and restates) the facility agreement to add a new schedule of commitments.

- A deal may require a large amount of simultaneous transfers.
- To avoid preparing a large number of transfer certificates, a Global Transfer Agreement may be used.
- But transparency may not suit all deals.

## Loan Market Association

- Founded 1996.
- Key objective is ‘improving liquidity, efficiency and transparency in the primary and secondary syndicated loan markets in EMEA’.
- Creates widely used loan documentation.

## Tax Implications

2 main types of tax which might affect asset sales: stamp duty (or sometimes, stamp duty reserve tax) and withholding tax.

- Sub-participation does not involve any transfer of rights, and so will not attract stamp duty.
- Novation will not usually involve a transfer of property for stamp duty purposes and so will not normally attract the tax (unless the asset includes, e.g., rights to acquire property).
- Assignment may attract stamp duty or SDRT, but exemptions can often by used.

> [!defn]
> Income tax in respect of recurring payments at source is sometimes collected by requiring the payer to make a deduction on account of income tax before making the payment. This deduction is generally known as withholding tax. It frequently applies to dividends (although not those paid by UK companies), interest and royalties.

In all asset sales between banks, and involving a UK resident/domiciled borrower, the relevance of withholding tax on interest payments will depend largely on whether the exemption under s 879 of the ITA 2007 applies.

The s 879 exemption will apply to loans which have been assigned as long as the advance was initially made by a ‘bank’ and the assignee is beneficially entitled to the interest and within the charge to UK corporation tax at the time interest is paid. If a loan is novated, this probably creates a new advance and so must be made to a ‘bank’ to ensure s 879 still applies.

> [!statute] s 879 ITA 2007 - interest paid on advances from banks
> (1) The duty to deduct a sum representing income tax under section 874 does not apply to a payment of interest on an advance from a bank if, at the time when the payment is made, the person beneficially entitled to the interest is within the charge to corporation tax as respects the interest [F1or is a bank that would be within the charge to corporation tax as respects the interest apart from section 18A of CTA 2009].
> 
> (2) Section 991 (meaning of “bank”) applies for the purposes of this section.

Summary – withholding tax not payable if:

- The bank is a UK corporation taxpayer
- The bank is international, but there is a double-tax treaty between the bank's country and the UK

## FSMA Implications

> [!statute] s 19 FSMA 2000
> No person may carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom or purport to do so unless he is an authorised person or an exempt person.

When selling participations, the bank should ensure that it is authorised to do so under the Act.

## Securitisation

Securitisation involves the owner of a pool of assets (the ‘originator’) transferring them to a specially formed company (a ‘special purpose vehicle’ or ‘SPV’). The SPV funds its purchase of the assets by issuing debt securities (it is therefore known as the ‘issuer’). Coupon and redemption of the debt securities are met with, and secured over, the asset pool.

## Bank's Perspective

- Most banks will require the flexibility to sell a loan if they decide it is necessary or desirable, but will accept some restrictions.
- A bank’s solicitor should ensure the facility transfer language allows transfer not just to other banks but also to trusts, funds, or other entities engaged in buying loans.

## Borrower's Perspective

However, a borrower’s relationship with its lenders will be crucial if it requires waivers to actual or potential defaults, if it wants to make changes to the loan documents going forward, or needs tolerance in interpreting provisions.

Most facilities allow transfer subject to the borrower's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Commonly negotiated conditions:

- Borrower consent deemed given if not given within a certain timeframe
- Transfers to borrower's competitors prohibited
- Transfers to certain fund types prohibited (those more activist ones)
- List of named institutions to which banks can transfer without consent pre-agreed.
- Freedom to transfer upon the borrower's event of default?

> [!question] Can a borrower buy back portions of their own loan debt?
> - This is a very cheap way to repay a debt. 
> - May be issues with prepayment restrictions, pro-rata sharing between lenders, restrictions on cash usage, and issues with novation. 
> - Even if buy-back is allowed, the buying entity is usually required to allow all the syndicate banks a chance to sell.
