# Finance for Buyer

## Introduction

Check the client has sufficient funds available for the purchase and related expenses.

- Ask when taking instructions
- Ask again just before exchange of contracts.

Secured debt finance considered.

### Arranged Mortgage

If the client has already arranged a mortgage, just check the figures. If the mortgage is a rip-off, suggest the client reconsiders her choice of finance.

### FSMA 2000

If you are carrying out a ‘specified activity’ in relation to a regulated mortgage contract, you must be authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA 2000).

See [[Professional Conduct and Regulation 1#Financial Services Regulation]].

‘Specified activities’ will include arranging or advising on a regulated mortgage contract,

unless you are arranging the execution of a mortgage chosen independently by the client or on the advice of an authorised person. General advice as to what type of loan to take out will not require authorisation as it will not amount to a ‘specified activity’.

> [!defn] Regulated Mortgage Contract
> A regulated mortgage contract is a contract which meets the following conditions at the time it is entered into:
> 1. the borrower is an individual or a trustee;
> 2. the lender takes a first legal charge over property in the UK; and
> 3. at least 40% of the property is occupied by the borrower or a member of his immediate family, or is intended for their occupation.

If a specified activity is involved, and you are not authorised, need to rely on the 'professional firms exemption'. Allows firms operating under it to arrange or advise on a

regulated mortgage contract, subject to certain conditions, even though they are not authorised by the regulators.

> [!note]
> The ability to ‘advise’ under the
> professional firms' exemption does not include recommending a client to enter into a regulated mortgage contract, except where that advice consists of an endorsement of a recommendation given to the client by an authorised person.

## Sources of Finance

Mortgage finance is available from:

1. banks;
2. building societies;
3. the client’s employer;
4. a private mortgage (eg, a loan from a relative or from a trust fund); and
5. finance houses.

### Banks and Building Societies

Banks have the reputation of being slightly more flexible in the application of their lending criteria and of being more willing to consider unusual property and higher-value loans.

### Client's Employer

Some large company employers (e.g., banks) offer mortgages at concessionary rates to their employees.

### Private Mortgage

A client may sometimes be able to arrange mortgage finance through a loan from a relative or rom a private trust fund. The terms of such a loan are a matter for agreement between the parties involved, which must always be separately advised.

### Finance Houses

- Not generally considered to be a primary source of finance for a client who is seeking a loan for the purchase of property, particularly a residential client.
- May be approached from a second loan
- Affected by [s 58 Consumer Credit Act 1974](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/section/58) (opportunity for withdrawal from prospective land mortgage)

### Government Schemes

e.g., help to buy.

## Amount of Loan

A residential borrower will typically be asked to provide evidence of salary and details of the number of dependants, debts and household outgoings

Lenders will look more favourably on borrowers with a positive credit rating and a stable financial position.

The maximum sum is usually subject to the further qualification that the amount of the loan does not exceed a fixed percentage of the lender’s valuation of the property (not the purchase price).

The loan-to-value ratio will not currently usually exceed 90%.

### MIG

Remember that the lender’s valuation of the property is frequently less than the asking price for the property. Where the lender agrees to lend a sum in excess of the normal percentage of the valuation, it may be a term of the loan that the borrower pays for a single premium insurance policy (‘a mortgage guarantee policy’ or ‘MIG’) which is taken out by the lender. If the lender has to exercise its power of sale, it is insured against any loss it may incur due to having lent more than the normal percentage of the value.

### Letting Property

Where the property is let, the lender will also apply the interest rate cover ratio. T

Typically, a lender will insist that the expected rental income must exceed the mortgage repayments by a certain percentage.

## Types of Mortgage

Two types: repayment or interest-only.

### Repayment Mortgage

Throughout the term of the loan the borrower will make monthly repayments to the lender, part of which represents a repayment of the capital sum borrowed. The balance is interest on the loan. At the end of the mortgage term, the loan has been completely repaid and the mortgage is discharged.

### Interest-only Mortgage

With an interest-only mortgage, the borrower pays off only the interest on the loan, so that the whole of the capital remains outstanding at the end of the loan term. The borrower will usually enter into a separate investment plan, such as an endowment policy, an ISA or a pension plan, to enable him to pay off the outstanding capital.

These are more risky.

### Combined Mortgage

A combination of the above.

## Interest Rate

### Residential

The borrower will have to choose the method by which the interest on the loan is set.

- Standard Variable Mortgage Rate
	- Simplest
	- Based on base rate
- Fixed rate mortgage
	- Set for a specified period
- Capped rate mortgage
	- Puts a max limit on the interest rate
- Discount rate mortgage
	- Offers a percentage discount from Standard Variable Mortgage Rate
- Tracker mortgage
	- Percentage above base rate

In most cases, lender charges a redemption penalty if the borrower repays the loan during the special rate period.

### Commercial

Interest rates tend to be higher and loan periods shorter to reflect the higher risk.

## Payment Protection (residential)

Problems will arise if the borrower or one of the co-borrowers dies, suffers a critical illness or becomes unemployed during the term of the mortgage.

Lenders will sometimes require the borrower to take out a ‘mortgage protection policy’, which guarantees to repay the balance outstanding on the mortgage in the event of the borrower’s death.

Usual for stuff like this to be covered in insurance policies/ can be taken out separately.

Such policies are regulated by FSMA 2000.

## Islamic Mortgages

There are various finance schemes that are Sharia compliant and avoid the payment of interest.

The Murabaha involves a bank buying the property and then reselling it to the actual buyer at a higher price. This price is then paid to the bank by instalments over a period of years.

Alternatively, the Ijara and Diminishing Musharaka schemes allow the bank to purchase the property and then lease it to the buyer in return for rent. At the end of the lease, the bank agrees to transfer the property to the buyer.
