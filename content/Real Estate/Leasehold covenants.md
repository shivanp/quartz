# Leasehold covenants

## Lease Anatomy

A lease is created when one person with an estate in land (the Landlord) grants the temporary right to another person (the Tenant) to use and enjoy that land exclusively.

The right may be granted for weeks, months or years. It may be in a residential or commercial context.

For many individuals and businesses that cannot afford, or do not want to commit, to buying a freehold estate, entering into a lease is the most practical option.

In order for there to be a lease, there must be:  
Certain term + Exclusive possession + Compliance with the correct formalities

Assuming these are present, the traditional basic “anatomy” of a lease will be explored. No two leases are the same, but as a rough guide, the traditional basic “anatomy” of a lease is as follows:

### Parties, Date, Definitions, Interpretation Provisions

Most leases usually start with the date of the lease and the names of the landlord and tenant and their addresses. As with any well drafted legal agreement, there will be a section giving guidelines on interpretation and definitions such as 'Premises', 'Insured Risks' or 'Common Parts' of a building.

### Demise and Rents

These are the operative provisions of the lease where the landlord demises or grants the lease of the premises to the tenant for a specified term in consideration of the rent paid, and the covenants entered into.

### Tenant’s Covenants

The basic rule = that a tenant may do all things that an owner of an estate can do unless the lease prohibits such actions.

Leases are therefore drafted in a prohibitory or negative manner, setting out what the tenant cannot do by way of a number of tenant covenants.

This section may either be in the main part of the lease or in a schedule to the lease but will cover issues such as the obligation to pay the rent, what the tenant can use the premises for, whether the tenant can make any alterations to the premises and whether the tenant will be permitted to assign or underlet the premises.

If there is no mention of an action in a lease, the tenant is free to do it.

> [!example] Tenant covenants
> Payment of rent, payment of service charge, use of premises, covenant against assignment and subletting.

### Landlord’s Covenants

Again, this can often be in a schedule to the lease, though there tends to be far fewer covenants given than those by the tenant.

If the lease is a lease of part of a building (e.g., a floor in an office block or unit on an estate) the landlord may also covenant to provide services, maintain common areas and to insure the building.

The most common is the covenant for quiet enjoyment. Quiet enjoyment is a landlord’s covenant not to interfere with the tenant’s possession or enjoyment of the property during the term of the lease. It covers the acts of the landlord and the lawful acts of anyone claiming under him.

Examples of breaches of the covenant for quiet enjoyment include:

- The erection of scaffolding hindering access to the property ([[Owen v Gadd [1956] 2 QB 99]])
- Persistent intimidation of the tenant to induce him to leave ([[Kenny v Preen [1963] 1 QB 499]]).

### Guarantor’s Covenants

An individual or company guarantor may also be a party to the lease and will covenant to guarantee payments that must be made under the lease and the performance of any other obligations so that if the tenant defaults in payment, the landlord is able to call upon the guarantor.

### Provisos, Agreements and Declarations

This section of the lease is a kind of miscellaneous section, dealing with a number of matters. For example:

- Forfeiture - The right of the landlord to bring the lease to an early end in the event of tenant breach.
- What happens in the event of damage and destruction by insured risks.
- Clauses dealing with the exclusion of security of tenure provisions in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. A right to remain in premises at the end of the lease term and to request the grant of a new lease.

### Rights Granted

The tenant may need a right of way to access the premises or a right to park cars in a nearby car park. These [[easements]] will need to be set out clearly in the lease.

Examples may include rights over other parts of the building (e.g., to use common parts and conducting media for utilities.)

### Rights Excepted and Reserved

The landlord may need to reserve rights for itself to access the tenant’s premises, perhaps to run cables through it or to carry out repairs to the rest of the building.

### Other Provisions

| Provision                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rent review                                                            | A mechanism to review the rent at regular intervals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Service charge (where the lease is of part of a property or an estate) | A sum of money charged by the landlord to tenants to cover costs of services to tenants within a property (such as an industrial estate, block of flats, shopping centre). The charges cover costs to do with maintenance and repairs of exteriors (roofs etc) and common parts, but exclude the tenant’s demised areas because the tenants will usually have agreed to repair those areas themselves in the lease. |

### Execution

The landlord and the tenant and any guarantor will need to execute the document in accordance with normal attestation rules.

To be legal, a lease must be granted by deed ([LPA 1925, s 52](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/52)) unless it falls within the exception for short leases of 3 years or less under [LPA 1925, s 54(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/54). A deed must comply with [LP (MP) A 1989, s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/1).

### Prescribed Lease Clauses

When the Land Registration Act 2002 came into force more leases became registrable. The Land Registry devised a method to speed up lease registration. Where you are granting a registrable lease, your lease must include a list of **Prescribed Lease Clauses** at the front. You will see that, in the majority of cases, the main areas to focus on will be: date of lease; landlord’s title number; parties; term; [[easements]] granted and reserved.

> [!summary]
> Most residential and commercial leases follow a basic structure which includes the following provisions:
> 
> - Parties, date, definitions, interpretation provisions
> - Demise and rents
> - Tenants covenants
> - Landlord ’s covenants
> - Rights granted / excepted and reserved
> - Execution
> 
> A lease may also contain a forfeiture provision, a clause dealing with insured risks, and provisions relating to security of tenure, rent review and service charge. A tenant may do anything not expressly prohibited by the lease. A covenant for quiet enjoyment means a landlord must not interfere with a tenant’s possession, use or enjoyment of the premises.

## Key Covenants in Leases

![[leases 3_1.jpg]]

Four of the main covenants found in leases are introduced: repair, alterations, user, and alienation.

The basic rule is that a tenant may do all the things that an owner of an estate can do unless the lease prohibits such actions. For this reason, leases are drafted in a prohibitory or negative manner, setting out what the tenant cannot do by way of a number of tenant covenants. A lease will also contain covenants given by the landlord.

> [!defn] Leasehold covenant
> A promise contained in a lease given by a landlord or a tenant.

### Types of Covenant

In leasehold work you need to be able to distinguish between different types of covenant;

- Absolute
- Qualified
- Fully qualified

| Type of covenant         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Absolute covenant        | If there is an absolute covenant the tenant is completely prohibited from doing something (eg 'The Tenant shall not underlet part of the Premises'); the tenant is absolutely not able to underlet one of its rooms in its office block and will be at the mercy of the landlord, who will be able to consider or ignore any request to underlet part.                                |
| Qualified covenant       | If there is a qualified covenant (e.g. the Tenant shall not make any non-structural alterations to the Premises without the consent of the Landlord) then the tenant can go and ask the landlord for his consent, although the landlord does not have to give it! There are  statutes relating to user, alterations and alienation intervene with regard to such qualified covenants. |
| Fully qualified covenant | If there is a fully qualified covenant (e.g., the Tenant shall not make any internal, non-structural alterations to the Premises without the consent of the Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld’) the landlord has to be reasonable if he is going to withhold his consent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Reasonableness

The courts have considered the test of 'reasonableness’, especially in respect of cases on assignment, underletting and carrying out alterations.

[[International Drilling Fluids Ltd v Louisville Investments (Uxbridge) Ltd [1986] Ch 513]] stated the basic principles to be applied in determining the reasonableness of a landlord’s decision and made it clear that a landlord is not entitled to refuse his consent on grounds which have nothing to do with the landlord and tenant relationship.

> [!example]
> It would not be reasonable for a landlord to refuse consent on the basis that he did not like the proposed assignee, or he supported a different football team. It must be something to do with, for example, the proposed assignee’s ability to pay the rent or bad references.

### Repair

A lease will generally include a covenant by the tenant relating to repair. Under a general repairing covenant, the tenant must, according to the Court of Appeal in [[Proudfoot v Hart (1890) LR 25 QBD 42]], keep the premises in the condition in which they would be kept by a reasonably minded owner, having regard to:

1. The character and type of premises at the beginning of the lease. The obligation is neither diminished nor increased by a change in the character of the neighbourhood.
2. The age of the premises.
3. The express words of the covenant.

Note that a covenant to keep the premises in repair also entails an obligation to put them in repair first, if at the time of the letting they were out of repair.

This can be a very onerous obligation if the premises are in a state of disrepair at the beginning of the term.

If the tenant simply wants to maintain the premises in the condition they were in at the outset of the lease, the tenant can employ a surveyor to survey the premises and report on the state of repair prior to taking the lease. Then a schedule of condition (photographs and verbal description of the premises prepared by a surveyor) can be annexed to the lease prior to the grant and the repairing covenant can then refer to it as evidence of the state of repair. The repair obligation would refer to the schedule of condition by stating that the tenant is 'under no obligation to put the premises in any better state of repair than as evidenced by the schedule of condition annexed to the lease'. Beyond this, the tenant then has no obligation to the landlord.

#### Repair Vs Renewal

A covenant to repair does not require renewal of the whole or substantially the whole of the property. It is a question of degree whether the work involves repair or renewal, but if the works constitute 'renewal' rather than 'repair', they will not fall within the tenant’s repair obligation.

| Case                                                        | Ratio                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Lurcott v Wakely [1911] 1 KB 905]]                        | Whether works are classed as 'repair' or 'renewal' depends upon whether the whole or substantially the whole needs to be replaced. |
| [[Brew Brothers Ltd v Snax (Ross) Ltd [1970] 1 All ER 587]] | The question of whether works fall within the scope of a repairing covenant is one of degree.                                                                                                                                   |

### Alterations

Leases will normally allow the tenant to make some alterations to the premises.

Unless the lease stipulates otherwise, the tenant is free to carry out any alterations to the premises, subject to the legal doctrine of 'waste' which prevents alterations which would devalue the premises.

However, the landlord will usually wish to control this by:

1. Limiting the type of alterations permitted (e.g., only allowing non-structural alterations and prohibiting structural alterations.)
2. Requiring the landlord’s approval or consent (licence) in order to do the alteration works.
3. Requiring reinstatement/removal of alterations at the end of the lease term.

The [Landlord and Tenant Act (‘LTA’) 1927, s 19(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/36/section/19) applies to 'qualified' **alterations** covenants.

> [!statute] s 19(2) LTA 1927
> In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of this Act containing a covenant condition or agreement against the making of improvements without a licence or consent, such covenant condition or agreement shall be deemed, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary, to be **subject to a proviso that such licence or consent is not to be unreasonably withheld**; but this proviso does not preclude the right to require as a condition of such licence or consent the payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage to or diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises belonging to the landlord, and of any legal or other expenses properly incurred in connection with such licence or consent nor, in the case of an improvement which does not add to the letting value of the holding, does it preclude the right to require as a condition of such licence or consent, where such a requirement would be reasonable, an undertaking on the part of the tenant to reinstate the premises in the condition in which they were before the improvement was executed.

Where there is a qualified covenant against alteration then LTA 1927, s 19(2) implies into a qualified covenant against improvements a proviso that the landlord’s consent is not to be unreasonably withheld. It therefore **converts a qualified covenant against alterations that amount to improvements into a fully qualified one**.

#### Improvements

LTA 1927, s 19(2) only applies to 'improvements’. What then constitutes an ‘improvement?’

The leading case is [[Lambert v FW Woolworth & Co Limited [1938] Ch 833]] which held that 'improvements' are to be construed widely as works which improve the premises from the tenant’s perspective.

LTA 1927, s 19(2) allows the landlord to require as a condition of giving consent:

- payment of compensation for loss in value to the reversion caused by the alterations;
- reinstatement of the premises if reasonable (at the end of the lease term);
- payment of the landlord’s expenses in giving consent.

The above conditions would usually be set out in the **Licence for Alterations** but, even if they are not, the landlord is still permitted to ask for them.

#### Practicalities

In practice, most commercial leases will allow certain alterations with the landlord’s consent not to be unreasonably withheld and expressly prohibit others (e.g., structural alterations). LTA 1927, s 19(2) does not apply to these covenants, which are already fully qualified.

LTA 1927, s 19(2) has no effect on absolute covenants. However, even though there may be an absolute covenant in the lease against, e.g., structural alterations, this does not preclude the landlord from granting a one-off consent to a particular structural alteration. This one-off consent would be documented in a Licence for Alterations. The landlord would be free to stipulate any conditions to such consent he wanted, and these would not be subject to any test of reasonableness.

### User

A lease will often contain a tenant covenant relating to the use of the premises. A landlord will want control over what the tenant is to use the premises for, e.g., for residential use or a specific business purpose. A tenant may be able to change the use of the premises depending upon the type of covenant.

#### Premium for Consent

[LTA 1927, s 19(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/36/section/19) applies to 'qualified' **user** covenants.

> [!statute] s 19(3) LTA 1927
> In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of this Act containing a covenant condition or agreement against the alteration of the user of the demised premises, without licence or consent, such covenant condition or agreement shall, if the alteration does not involve any structural alteration of the premises, be deemed, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary, to be subject to a proviso that **no fine or sum of money in the nature of a fine, whether by way of increase of rent or otherwise, shall be payable for or in respect of such licence or consent**; but this proviso does not preclude the right of the landlord to require payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage to or diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises belonging to him and of any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with such licence or consent. 

If the change of use does involve a change to the structure, the landlord can increase the rent or charge the tenant a lump sum (in the statute referred to as a 'fine' or 'premium') in return for the consent.

The landlord will be entitled to recover its costs and expenses involved in the application for consent, e.g., surveyor’s fees and legal fees.

### Alienation

Alienation is the term used to describe a method for the tenant disposing of the whole, or part, of their interest in a leasehold property.

In practice, this term is usually used to describe assignment, underletting and parting with possession, although it does encompass charging/mortgaging the lease or surrendering it.

Restrictions on alienation are very common in shorter leases.

> [!summary]
> - Unless expressly prohibited in the lease, a tenant is free to do anything.
> - A leasehold covenant is a promise by either the landlord or tenant. Usual tenant covenants found in most leases relate to repair, user, alterations and alienation.
> - A covenant to repair includes an obligation to put premises into repair. It does not include renewal of the whole or substantially the whole of the premises. A covenant to repair can be limited by a schedule of condition.
> - A covenant can be absolute, qualified or fully qualified.
> - Statute intervenes in respect of certain qualified covenants.
> - **LTA 1927, s 19(2)** upgrades a qualified covenant to a fully qualified covenant in respect of works that constitute, in the eyes of the tenant, an improvement to the premises. It does, however, allow a landlord to impose a number of conditions upon its consent, which can include a requirement to reinstate.
> - **LTA 1927, s 19(3)** applies to qualified user covenants. It does not impose a reasonableness requirement but does prevent a landlord from demanding payment for its consent.

## Alienation Covenants

The basic rule is that a tenant can do anything not expressly prohibited. A lease will often therefore contain many restrictions on alienation. Landlords of shorter leases in particular will want to control what the tenant can do with their lease.

> [!defn] Alienation
> A method for the tenant disposing of the whole, or part, of their interest in a leasehold property. In practice, this term is usually used to describe assignment, underletting and parting with possession, although it does encompass charging/mortgaging the lease or surrendering it.

This element will explore assignment and underletting provisions and the impact of statute on certain types of alienation covenants.

### Assignment of a Lease

An assignment is the 'sale' by the tenant of the remainder of their lease to another party (the 'assignee'.) It is very common for a tenant to want to dispose of/sell the lease.

It is a way of handing the lease over to someone else. Perhaps a tenant has outgrown the leased property and needs to move to bigger premises, or perhaps the tenant has no need for the property because it is too large.

The party to whom the lease is sold (called the 'assignee') then becomes the immediate tenant of the landlord, but it is not necessary to amend the lease to show this. Further, in the case of a registered lease, the change of proprietor (i.e., the tenant) is shown in the Proprietorship Register of the leasehold title.

If the lease is silent as to assignment, then the benefit of a lease is freely assignable.

Most leases contain restrictions on assignment so that the landlord has to consent to the assignment and therefore has control over who ends up being the tenant.

The covenant is construed in the tenant’s favour so that:

- A covenant against assignment does not prohibit subletting of the whole or part ([[Church v Brown (1908) 15 Ves Jr 258, 33 ER 752]]).
- A covenant against sub-letting the whole does not prohibit a subletting of a part ([[Wilson v Rosenthal (1906) 22 TLR 233]]).

A landlord’s consent is formally recorded in a deed called a **Licence to Assign** to which the landlord, tenant and assignee will all be parties.

#### Formalities to Transfer the Lease:

**Deed + Registration**

As with a freehold transfer, Land Registry form TR1 is often used

LPA 1925, s 52 requires a deed be used to transfer a legal estate. There is no short lease exception, and even if the lease being assigned does fall within the short lease exception, the assignment must still be by deed.

If the lease is registered at the Land Registry, the deed of assignment must also be registered to update the registered proprietor of the lease as the assignee.

### Subletting of a Lease

Rather than assign the lease, a tenant could instead sublet the property. This involves a tenant granting a lease out of its own lease. This lease is called an underlease (or sublease).

The lease out of which it was granted is now called the headlease (or superior lease). The tenant grants a new lease out of its own lease.

#### Rationale

Subletting would mean that the tenant would always be responsible for performing the covenants in the lease and still be in the picture until the end of the lease term. Reasons could be that the tenant does not need the property for a temporary period, so can earn an income from the undertenant for this period. Perhaps the tenant tried to market the property for an assignment, but found that no one came forward because the rent payable under the lease was too high against the backdrop of the current market rents. Perhaps underletting at a lower rent means the tenant at least goes some way to minimising his outgoings.

#### Formalities

The procedure is largely the same as for the grant of a new lease out of a freehold, as it simply involves a new underlease document being drafted and entered into. The general rule is therefore that the lease must be granted by deed ([LPA 1925, s 52](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/52)) which must be registered if the term is for over 7 years ([LRA 2002, s 27(2)(b)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27)).

The headlease will generally require the tenant to obtain landlord’s consent to an underletting of the premises. As with an assignment, this is formally recorded in a deed called a **Licence to Underlet,** to which the landlord, tenant and under-tenant will all be party.

### Statutory Intervention with Alienation Covenants

#### Absolute Covenants

> “The Tenant shall not do []”

**No** statutory provisions apply to an absolute prohibition against any particular dealing, so there is nothing that can aid a tenant here if it wanted to ask for a landlord’s consent to deal.

However, the landlord could as a 'one-off' waive the prohibition, but he is under no obligation to do so.

Leases nowadays generally contain an absolute prohibition against assignment of part of the property. Where a property is not capable of being subdivided, leases will also contain an absolute prohibition of underletting of part of the property.

#### Qualified Covenants

> “The Tenant shall not do [] without the landlord's consent.”

[LTA 1927, s 19(1)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/36/section/19) applies to all forms of alienation (so including assignment and underletting.)

> [!statute] s 19(1)(a) LTA 1927
> (1) In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of this Act containing a covenant condition or agreement against assigning, underletting, charging or parting with the possession of demised premises or any part thereof without licence or consent, such covenant condition or agreement shall, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary, be deemed to be subject—
> 
> (a) to a proviso to the effect that s**uch licence or consent is not to be unreasonably withheld**, but this proviso does not preclude the right of the landlord to require payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with such licence or consent;

It assists tenants by converting a qualified covenant against alienation into a fully qualified covenant (i.e., where landlord’s consent is required, it is not to be unreasonably withheld).

#### Fully Qualified Covenants

> “The Tenant shall not do [] without the landlord's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.”

These type of covenants contain a proviso, be it expressly set out in the lease, or implied by [LTA 1927 s 19(1)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/36/section/19), to the effect that consent to an assignment or an underletting shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Today leases generally contain a fully qualified prohibition against the assignment or underletting of the whole of the property.

[[International Drilling Fluids Ltd v Louisville Investments (Uxbridge) Ltd [1986] Ch 513]] laid down guidelines as to when a court would consider a landlord to be acting reasonably or unreasonably in withholding consent.

### LTA 1988 S 1

The Landlord and Tenant Act 1988 (‘LTA 1988’), s 1 applies to fully qualified covenants and to all forms of alienation.

Where a tenant applies to the landlord in writing for consent, [LTA 1988, s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/26/section/1) provides that:

- The landlord must give written consent within a reasonable time (unless it is reasonable to refuse.)
- The burden is on the landlord to prove reasonable refusal – s1(6), and written reasons must be provided.
- The landlord is entitled to be given sufficient information to enable it to reach a decision.

A 'reasonable time' will not generally expire before this has been done, but the landlord must ask for further information if it requires it; if it delays in asking for this information that may amount to a refusal to give consent within a reasonable time.

#### 'Reasonable time’ Under LTA 1988, S 1?

It will depend on the facts and circumstances, but will usually be measured in days or weeks rather than months and will depend on the landlord having been provided with sufficient details of the proposed transaction to allow it to make a decision.

It was considered in the case of [[Dong Bang Minerva (UK) v Davina [1996] 3 WLUK 117]] that 28 days from receipt of the application and references by the landlord was a reasonable period within which to inform the tenant of the decision.

#### Consequences of Non-compliance

If a landlord does not comply with the LTA 1988, it may be liable for tortious damages for breach of statutory duty.

A tenant could incur costs such as agent’s fees (for the agent who markets the property) and lawyer’s fees (for negotiating the documentation.) If consent is not given in time or is unreasonably withheld, the tenant could recover these losses.

If the landlord’s behaviour is particularly unreasonable a tenant may have exemplary damages awarded.

> [!example] Examples of reasonable refusal
> - Unsatisfactory tenant’s reference.
> - The proposed assignee’s use of the property would damage the landlord’s own commercial interests as the assignee proposed to run a rival business next door.
> - The proposed subletting was at a substantial premium and at a rent well below the open market value.
> - Where the existing tenant is already in breach of covenant – the landlord can insist upon the breach being remedied before giving consent unless it is clear that the assignee can remedy the breach.

> [!example] Examples of unreasonable refusal
> 
> - Where the proposed assignee was a diplomat who would be protected by diplomatic immunity.
> - Where the landlord’s intention was to bring the tenancy to an end and the landlord did not therefore propose to give consent to any assignee, not just to the particular assignee in question.
> - Where the proposed assignee was already a tenant of the landlord in another property which would have been difficult to re-let.

### Pre-conditions for Alienation for New Tenancies

[LTA 1927, s 19(1A)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/36/section/19) applies to any lease that has been granted on or after 1 January 1996. In new leases, LTA 1927, s 19(1A) (inserted by s 22 Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995) states that:

- The landlord and tenant can agree the circumstances in which the landlord may withhold consent to an assignment or underletting.
- The landlord and tenant can agree the conditions subject to which consent may be granted.
- Such circumstances or conditions will be automatically reasonable if imposed by the landlord when giving consent to assign or underlet.
- These circumstances and conditions are agreed in advance by including them in the lease when it is drafted.

> [!statute] s 19(1A) LTA 1927
> Where the landlord and the tenant under a qualifying lease have entered into an agreement specifying for the purposes of this subsection—
> - (a) any circumstances in which the landlord may withhold his licence or consent to an assignment of the demised premises or any part of them, or
> - (b) any conditions subject to which any such licence or consent may be granted,
> 
> then the landlord—
> - (i) shall not be regarded as unreasonably withholding his licence or consent to any such assignment if he withholds it on the ground (and it is the case) that any such circumstances exist, and
> - (ii) if he gives any such licence or consent subject to any such conditions, shall not be regarded as giving it subject to unreasonable conditions;
> 
> and section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1988 (qualified duty to consent to assignment etc.) shall have effect subject to the provisions of this subsection.

### Conditions Commonly Attached to the landlord’s Consent for an Assignment

One of the common conditions attached to the landlord’s consent for an assignment under LTA 1927, s 19(1A) and one seen in most commercial leases, is that the outgoing tenant enters into an **Authorised Guarantee Agreement** (AGA) promising to perform the incoming assignee’s obligations under the lease, if it defaults.

AGAs are a creation of [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 (LT(C)A 1995), s 16](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/16).

An AGA is a guarantee by an outgoing tenant of the immediate assignee’s obligations only, so that in the event of any future assignment by the assignee, a further AGA will be required from the assignee (in its capacity as the outgoing tenant.)

The landlord will only ever have the current tenant and the tenant immediately prior to the current tenant 'on the hook'.

> [!summary]
> If a tenant assigns their lease, they are transferring their leasehold estate to a new party who ‘steps into the shoes’ of the tenant. If a tenant underlets their premises, they grant a new lease to a third party out of their own lease.
> 
> To assign a lease, a deed must be used. If the lease is registered, the assignment must be registered at the Land Registry.
> 
> A qualified covenant against alienation will be ‘upgraded’ to a fully qualified covenant so that the landlord cannot unreasonably withhold their consent **(LTA 1927, s 19(1)(a).)**
> 
> In acting reasonably, the landlord cannot refuse consent on grounds that have nothing to do with the landlord and tenant relationship.
> 
> **LTA 1988, s 1** applies to fully qualified covenants and requires a landlord to respond to a tenant’s request in writing within a ‘reasonable period’ (deemed to be 28 days).
> 
> **LTA 1927, s19(1A)** applies to new leases and allows a landlord and tenant to agree in advance the circumstances a landlord can refuse consent, which will automatically be reasonable, and the conditions a landlord is reasonably entitled to impose, which may include a requirement upon assignment that the outgoing tenant enters into an **AGA.**

[[Enforcing leasehold covenants]]

## Running of Leasehold Covenants

The Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 made some fundamental changes to the running of leasehold covenants on assignment of a lease / the reversion. In relation to a lease granted on or after 1 January 1996, these new rules govern whether an assignee of the reversion or the lease can sue or be sued for a breach of covenant.

> [!statute] LT(C)A 1995 s 3
> 
> (1) The benefit and burden of all landlord and tenant covenants of a tenancy—
> - (a) shall be annexed and incident to the whole, and to each and every part, of the premises demised by the tenancy and of the reversion in them, and
> - (b) shall in accordance with this section pass on an assignment of the whole or any part of those premises or of the reversion in them.
> 
> (2) Where the assignment is by the tenant under the tenancy, then as from the assignment the assignee—
> - (a) becomes bound by the tenant covenants of the tenancy except to the extent that—
> 	- (i) immediately before the assignment they did not bind the assignor, or
> 	- (ii) they fall to be complied with in relation to any demised premises not comprised in the assignment; and
> - (b) becomes entitled to the benefit of the landlord covenants of the tenancy except to the extent that they fall to be complied with in relation to any such premises.
> 
> (3) Where the assignment is by the landlord under the tenancy, then as from the assignment the assignee—
> - (a) becomes bound by the landlord covenants of the tenancy except to the extent that—
> 	- (i) immediately before the assignment they did not bind the assignor, or
> 	- (ii) they fall to be complied with in relation to any demised premises not comprised in the assignment; and
> - (b) becomes entitled to the benefit of the tenant covenants of the tenancy except to the extent that they fall to be complied with in relation to any such premises.
> 
> (4) In determining for the purposes of subsection (2) or (3) whether any covenant bound the assignor immediately before the assignment, any waiver or release of the covenant which (in whatever terms) is expressed to be personal to the assignor shall be disregarded.
> 
> (5) Any landlord or tenant covenant of a tenancy which is restrictive of the user of land shall, as well as being capable of enforcement against an assignee, be capable of being enforced against any other person who is the owner or occupier of any demised premises to which the covenant relates, even though there is no express provision in the tenancy to that effect.
> 
> (6) Nothing in this section shall operate—
> - (a) in the case of a covenant which (in whatever terms) is expressed to be personal to any person, to make the covenant enforceable by or (as the case may be) against any other person; or
> - (b) to make a covenant enforceable against any person if, apart from this section, it would not be enforceable against him by reason of its not having been registered under the Land Registration Act 2002 or the M1Land Charges Act 1972.
> 
> (7) To the extent that there remains in force any rule of law by virtue of which the burden of a covenant whose subject matter is not in existence at the time when it is made does not run with the land affected unless the covenantor covenants on behalf of himself and his assigns, that rule of law is hereby abolished in relation to tenancies.

LT(C)A 1995, s 3 provides for the automatic transmission of the benefit and burden of all landlord covenants to the new owner of the reversion, and of the benefit and burden of all tenant covenants to the assignee.

If the L(C)TA 1995, s 3 provides for the automatic transmission of the benefit and burden of leasehold covenants, this means:

- when a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee acquires the benefit and burden of all the covenants in the lease.
- when a landlord assigns the reversionary interest, the incoming landlord acquires the benefit and burden of the covenants.

### ‘Expressed To Be personal’

The only exception to this rule in the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 3(6) is for those covenants which are ‘expressed to be personal to any person’. The benefit and burden of covenants which are expressed to be personal will not pass to a third party.

Expressed to be personal’ is not defined in the L(C)TA 1995, but it appears to mean that the covenant is expressly stated to be between two named parties to the lease.

### Extent of assignee’s Liability

There is a limit on the extent of the assignee’s liability under:

> [!statute] LTA 1995 s 23(1)
> 
> Where as a result of an assignment a person becomes, by virtue of this Act, bound by or entitled to the benefit of a covenant, he shall not by virtue of this Act have any liability or rights under the covenant in relation to any time falling before the assignment.

The case of [[Edlington Properties Ltd v JH Fenner & Co Ltd (2006) 1 WLR 1583]] shows that it is the intention of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 23(1) that the parties remain liable for the breaches which occur during their period of occupation.

### Excluded Assignments

Under LT(C)A 1995, s 5 a tenant with a new lease will obtain an automatic release from the tenant’s covenants upon assignment, unless there has been an excluded assignment.

> [!example]
> If a lease is assigned in breach of an alienation covenant, this is an ‘excluded assignment’.

The [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/11) states that any excluded assignment will be excluded from the automatic release provisions under the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 5 for the purposes of that assignment, and that the defaulting tenant will not be released from its obligations under the terms of the lease.

The tenant may only be released from their obligations when there is a subsequent assignment of the lease which is not an excluded assignment.

### Suing a Former Tenant

An assignee of the lease becomes liable from the date of assignment for all covenants in the lease under the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 3 (other than those expressed to be personal).

It makes sense that a landlord will seek to enforce any breach of covenant against the current tenant; the current tenant should be easy to locate and the landlord may be able to obtain an equitable remedy, such as specific performance.

However, should the assignee be unwilling or unable to comply, the landlord may look to other parties for compensation in respect of breaches of covenant committed by a subsequent assignee.

If the outgoing tenant has been automatically released from its obligations under the lease on assignment under the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/5), it will not be liable. However, if the outgoing tenant has provided an authorised guarantee agreement under the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 16](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/16) on assignment, the landlord could sue the former tenant who is guaranteeing the obligations of their immediate successor.

The tenant provides the AGA to the landlord on assignment.

```mermaid
graph LR

id1(Landlord) --> id2(Tenant)
id2 --> id3(Assignee)
```

An **authorised guarantee agreement** is the guarantee by an outgoing tenant of the obligations of the incoming assignee.

If the landlord has requested an authorised guarantee agreement under the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 16](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/16) from the outgoing tenant/assignor on assignment, the landlord’s remedy is limited to damages. Such damages may be extensive. There are however methods by which a former tenant may be able to recoup damages paid out on behalf of a defaulting assignee.

### Indemnities

Under a new lease, an outgoing tenant should ensure that their assignee enters into an express indemnity covenant on assignment whereby the assignee agrees with the assignor to pay the rent and to perform all the covenants for the remainder of the lease. The former tenant may then sue the assignee for breach of the indemnity covenant and recoup the damages paid to the landlord.

Alternatively, in the absence of an express indemnity covenant, the assignor could claim an indemnity at common law under Moule v Garrett.

The former tenant has the benefit of a quasi-contractual course of action under the rule in [[Moule v Garrett (1872) LR 7 Exch 101]], which states that, where one person is compelled to pay damages because of the legal default of another, the former is entitled to recover those damages from the defaulting party. This means that a **former tenant can theoretically sue directly a subsequent assignee** in respect of breaches committed by that assignee. (This rule can only be used to take action against assignees, and not sub-tenants.)

These methods of indemnity are of **limited practical value**. If the assignee in possession were worth suing, the landlord would have sued it in the first place!

The outgoing tenant ought to make sure that it assigns to a financially sound and trustworthy assignee.

### Subleases

When there is a sublease in place, i.e. the tenant has created a lease out of their own lease, there is no direct relationship between the (head) landlord and the subtenant. The landlord is not the direct landlord of the subtenant. This means that the landlord, who is usually the owner of the land, might not be able to enforce the covenants in the head lease directly against the subtenant, the occupier of the land.

```mermaid
graph LR

id1(Landlord) --> id2(Tenant)
id2 --> id3(Subtenant)
```

Despite the lack of direct relationship, there is a method by which the landlord can sue a subtenant directly for a breach of covenant.

The Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act, s 3(5) states:

> Any landlord or tenant covenant of a tenancy which is restrictive of the user of land shall, as well as being capable of enforcement against an assignee, be capable of being enforced against any other person who is the owner or occupier of any demised premises to which the covenant relates, even though there is no express provision in the tenancy to that effect.

Section 3(5) appears to mean that if a subtenant is occupying the premises, the landlord will be able to enforce all restrictive covenants in the head lease against the subtenant.

In short, **restrictive covenants** in new leases may be enforced against **any** owner or occupier of the premises.

However, landlords will not be able to enforce directly against a subtenant any positive covenants. If the subtenant’s conduct puts the tenant in breach of its covenants in the head lease, the landlord can enforce the breach of covenant against its immediate tenant.

The effect of this is as follows:

- Any tenant (whether the original tenant or an assignee) knowing they are responsible for breaches of the subtenant is likely to include a provision in the sublease in which the subtenant covenants to observe and perform the covenants contained in the head lease. This makes it easier for the tenant to control the actions of the subtenant and it indirectly protects the landlord;
- If the landlord forfeits the head lease, the sublease is also automatically terminated, subject to a claim for relief. The threat of this should be a strong incentive to a subtenant to observe the covenants in the head lease.

> [!note]
> Relief is where a tenant or subtenant can apply to have a forfeiture or termination of the lease set aside by the court.

In addition, a prudent landlord will, as a condition of consent to the subletting, insist on any subtenant of the property entering into direct covenants with it to observe and perform the covenants in the lease. This will create a contractual relationship between the landlord and the subtenant, enabling enforcement of the covenants based upon the law of contract.

> [!summary]
> Upon assignment of a new lease, the LT(C)A 1995 provides for the automatic transmission of the benefit and burden of the covenants to the new owner of the reversion / the lease.
> 
> The only exception is that the benefit and burden of covenants which are expressed to be personal will not pass to a third party.
> 
> If a lease is assigned in breach of an alienation covenant, this is an ‘excluded assignment’ and the defaulting tenant will not be released from its obligations under the terms of the lease.
> 
> If a landlord chooses to sue a former tenant who remains liable for the covenants under an authorised guarantee agreement, the former tenant may rely on an express or common law indemnity to recoup its losses from the defaulting tenant.
> 
> A landlord may sue a subtenant for breach of a restrictive covenant in the headlease.

## Authorised Guarantee Agreements

Under [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/5), a tenant with a new lease will generally obtain an automatic release from the burden of the tenant’s covenants (and the benefit of the landlord’s covenants) upon assignment of the lease. There is an exception to this rule under [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 16](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/16).

### Precondition

There are preconditions in the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 16(3): **the assignment must be either an absolute or a qualified assignment; and the lease must contain a condition that the outgoing tenant will provide an AGA**:

> [!defn]
> The landlord, as a condition of granting consent to the assignment, may require the outgoing tenant to guarantee the performance of its immediate successor in title. This form of guarantee is described in the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 16 as an ‘authorised guarantee agreement’ or ‘AGA’.

An authorised guarantee agreement is the guarantee by an outgoing tenant of the obligations of the incoming assignee. The tenant provides the AGA to the landlord on assignment.

### Limits to an AGA

There are limits imposed on the form of the guarantee to be given under the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 16(4).

> [!statute] s 16(4) LT(C)A 1995
> 
> An agreement is not an authorised guarantee agreement to the extent that it purports—
> 
> (a) to impose on the tenant any requirement to guarantee in any way the performance of the relevant covenant by any person other than the assignee; or
> 
> (b) to impose on the tenant any liability, restriction or other requirement (of whatever nature) in relation to any time after the assignee is released from that covenant by virtue of this Act.

The guarantee lasts for the period the assignee is the tenant of the premises (assuming the assignee is released upon his own assignment of the lease) and the outgoing tenant may only be asked to guarantee the assignee.

### Landlord’s Choice

The presence of an AGA provides the landlord with a choice. He could sue the current tenant and may be able to obtain an equitable remedy, such as specific performance. If the current tenant is not worth suing, the landlord could sue the outgoing tenant who is acting as guarantor for the assignee.

### Commercial Leases

In a commercial lease scenario, [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 22](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/22) allows the landlord to ask the tenant to satisfy certain conditions before consent to the assignment will be granted. Such conditions will be deemed reasonable for the purposes of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 (LTA 1927), s 19(1A).

One of the common conditions attached to the landlord’s consent for an assignment under the LTA 1927, s 19(1A) and one seen in most commercial leases, is that the outgoing tenant enters into an AGA promising to perform the incoming assignee’s obligations under the lease, if it defaults.

In new leases, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927, s 19(1A) (inserted by the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 22) states that:

- The landlord and tenant can agree the circumstances in which the landlord may withhold consent to an assignment or underletting.
- The landlord and tenant can agree the conditions subject to which consent may be granted.
- Such circumstances or conditions will be automatically reasonable if imposed by the landlord when giving consent to assign or underlet.

These circumstances and conditions are agreed in advance by including them in the lease when it is drafted.

> [!summary]
> - Under the **Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 5**, a tenant with a new lease will generally obtain an automatic release from the burden of the tenant’s covenants upon assignment.
> - There is an exception under **LT(C)A 1995, s 16**: the landlord may require the outgoing tenant to provide an authorised guarantee agreement, guaranteeing the performance of its immediate successor in title.
> - A landlord may only request an **AGA** if the assignment is either an absolute or a qualified assignment.
> - The **AGA** lasts for the period that the assignee is the tenant of the premises.
> - In a commercial lease scenario, the **LT(C)A 1995, s 22** allows the landlord to ask the tenant to satisfy certain conditions before consent to the assignment will be granted. An **AGA** is one such common condition.

## LT(C)A 1995 Retrospective Provisions

![[LT(C)A retrospective_1.jpg]]

There are some sections of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 which apply to all leases, regardless of when they were created. These are:

Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995

- s 17, Tenant Default Notice
- s 18, Liability for Variations
- s 19, Overriding Leases

These provisions apply to both old and new leases.

These provisions apply to former tenants who remain liable either under an old lease (existing tenant liability) or because of their liability under a new lease under an authorised guarantee agreement.

### Tenant Default Notice

The [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 17](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/17) states that where a landlord wishes to pursue a former tenant who remains liable under the terms of the lease for a fixed charge, the landlord must serve notice of the potential claim on such tenants within six months of the charge becoming due.

> [!tip]
> So practically, cannot recover more than 6 months rent at a time in this way. 

A fixed charge is defined in the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 17](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/17) as including arrears of rent, service charge or insurance premiums but not unascertained liabilities or damages which become ascertained only after a court order has been obtained.

If the landlord has not notified the former tenant of this claim and the amount due within this period, the landlord will be precluded from making a claim against him.

This also applies for guarantors under AGAs.

### Liability for Variations

The [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 18](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/18) states that former tenants and guarantors are not liable to pay any additional amounts owing in respect of variations which have been made to the lease subsequent to assignment which they could not have anticipated at the time when the lease was entered into.

> [!example]
> The former tenant who is still liable for the rent under an old lease or under an authorised guarantee agreement will still be liable for rent which is reviewed after assignment pursuant to the rent review clause in the original lease. Such a variation was anticipated at the time when the lease was entered into.

### Overriding Leases

The [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 19](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/19) provides for the creation of an overriding lease in certain circumstances.

If a former tenant is called upon by the landlord to pay rent or other fixed charges due from an assignee under the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 17, that former tenant is entitled to request from the landlord an overriding lease, becoming the immediate landlord of the defaulting party.

The overriding lease is granted for a term equal to the remaining term of the lease in question plus three days. It contains the same covenants as the lease in question (other than those covenants which are expressed to be personal).

If the former tenant requests an overriding lease, the landlord is obliged to grant it within a reasonable time.

The former tenant is then better able to ensure the assignee’s compliance under the terms of the lease, or terminate the assignee’s lease and re-let the property, or assign the overriding lease to a more reliable tenant.

> [!summary]
> - The **LT(C)A 1995, ss 17 to 19** apply to all leases regardless of when they were created.
> - Under the **LT(C)A 1995, s 17**, if a landlord wishes to pursue a former tenant for a fixed charge, the landlord must serve notice of the potential claim on such a tenant within six months of the charge becoming due.
> - Under the **LT(C)A 1995, s 18,** former tenants are not liable in respect of variations which have been made to the lease which they could not have anticipated at the time when the lease was entered into.
> - Under the **LT(C)A 1995, s 19**, if a former tenant pays rent or other fixed charges pursuant to **s 17**, that former tenant may request from the landlord an overriding lease.
> - When he is granted an overriding lease, the former tenant is better able to ensure the assignee’s compliance under the terms of the lease, or terminate the assignee’s lease.
