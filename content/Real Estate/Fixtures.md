# Fixtures

This principle is encapsulated in modern land law in the LPA 1925’s definition of ‘land’ which includes “other corporeal hereditaments” i.e., things attached/fixed to the land, what we ‘fixtures’ in practice.

This element of learning explores fixtures in detail, introducing and explaining the legal test for determining whether an object is a fixture or chattel.

## Legal Issue

> “…blocks of stone placed one on the top of another without any mortar or cement for the purpose of forming a dry stone wall would become part of the land, though the same stones, if deposited in a builder's yard and for convenience’ sake stacked on the top of each other in the form of a wall, would remain chattels…”  
> Blackburn J, [[Holland v Hodgson (1872) LR 7 CP328]]

- When does an item of property (i.e., chattel, which is personal property) become fixed to the land, so it forms part of it?
- How do we determine if an item is a fixture (and therefore part of the land) or a chattel, which isn’t part of the land?

This issue is particularly relevant when land is being sold. A buyer and seller will need to know what is a fixture (and should remain as it's part of the land) or a chattel, which a seller can take with it.

It is also very relevant when a lender takes possession of land if a borrower defaults on a mortgage payment. The lender will want to know what is a fixture and can therefore be sold with the mortgaged land.

## Test

The legal test for determining if an object is a fixture or chattel has two parts:

1. The **degree of annexation test** – this is the first test to be applied: the more firmly the object is fixed to the land or building, the more likely it is to be classified as a fixture. Even if it is fairly easy to remove, its character is still prima facie that of a fixture. If, on the other hand, it rests on the land by its own weight, it is generally considered to be a chattel.
2. The **purpose of annexation test** – the second test considers why the object is attached to the land/building. It asks whether the annexation was for the more convenient use or enjoyment of the chattel as a chattel, or to enhance the land or building in some way.

The ‘purpose test’ prevails over the ‘degree test’ where there is a discrepancy between them. The degree of annexation test raises a presumption, that the thing in question is or is not a fixture. This presumption can then be rebutted by objectively looking at the purpose.

Key case: [[Botham v TSB Bank plc [1996] 73 P & CR D1]]. It was held that

> ‘if the item, viewed objectively, is intended to be permanent and to afford a lasting improvement to the building, the thing will have become a fixture. If the attachment is temporary and is no more than is necessary for the item to be used and enjoyed, then it will remain a chattel.’

### Other Principles

| [[D’Eyncourt v Gregory (1866) LR 3 Eq 382]]     | If chattels are incorporated into the architectural design of a building, they may consequently be classified as fixtures even though they are not firmly affixed. |
| [[Leigh v Taylor [1902] AC 157]]                | A chattel may be securely affixed to the land but remain a chattel if the purpose of annexation is the better enjoyment of the chattel as such.                    |
| [[Elitestone Ltd v Morris [1997] 2 All E.R. 513]] | If a chattel cannot be removed from the land without destruction/demolition, it will be deemed to be intended to form part of the land and therefore a fixture.                                                                                                                                                                   |

In [[Berkley v Poulett [1977] 1 EGLR 86]] Lord Justice Scarman stated:

> “if ordinary skill was used, as it was, in their removal, they could be taken down, and in the event were taken down, without much trouble and without damage to the structure of the rooms. The decisive question is therefore as to the object and purpose of their affixing. …I find, applying the second test, that the pictures were not fixtures. They were put in place on the wall to be enjoyed as pictures.”

#### In Practice

Under [s 62 LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/62), a conveyance of land (i.e., a transfer) automatically includes all fixtures in the property, unless the items are specifically excluded from the sale in the contract under the LPA 1925, s 62(4).

If the contract is silent and does not specifically exclude any items from the sale, the seller may not remove a fixture after they have contracted to sell the property to another.

To avoid a dispute about whether an item is a fixture or chattel, it is common practice for the buyer and seller to agree which items are to pass on the sale by completing a [Law Society Fixtures and contents form (Form TA10)](http://www.suremove.uk.com/downloads/Law%20Society%20Fittings%20and%20Contents%20TA10.pdf) which forms part of the contract.
