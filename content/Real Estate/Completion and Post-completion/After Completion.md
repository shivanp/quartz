## Lender's Solicitor

Where a separate solicitor has been instructed to act for the buyer’s lender, the lender’s solicitor will normally have taken custody of the transfer deed and other title deeds on completion, and they will deal with the stamping and registration of the documents instead of the buyer’s solicitor.

## Undertakings

Once performed, formally ask the recipient to release the giver from the undertaking, so the giver has written evidence of the fulfilment of the undertaking.

## SDLT Returns

SDLT payable to HMRC within 14 days of completion. Payable on the value of land, not chattels. Buyer personally responsible for completing the tax return, but normally completed by the buyer's solicitor. SDLT return must be completed for most transactions even if SDLT not actually payable.

Form SDLT1 (if sent by post) must be signed personally by the buyer. HMRC will issue Form SDLT 5 to prove the return has been submitted and any tax paid. Without SDLT 5, transaction will not be accepted for registration on the Land Register.

Most returns submitted online. Solicitor must certify that SDLT return has been approved by the buyer. Sensible to get this in writing.

## Registration of Title

- Failure to make an application for first registration within **2 months** of completion results in transfer of the legal estate becoming void.
- Failure to make an application for registration of a dealing within the priority period of **30 working days** given by a pre-completion Land Registry search may result in the client's interest losing priority.

### Registration of Dealings

Where registered land is transferred, an application for registration of the dealing must be made on the appropriate application form, accompanied by the correct documentation and fee, and must be received by Land Registry within the priority period of 30 working days given by the Land Registry search made before completion.

Land Registry operates an early completion policy. Applies to all applications to discharge the whole of a registered charge where other applications are made (such as an application to register the transfer of the property to the buyer) but no evidence of satisfaction of the charge is supplied (perhaps because the lender has been slow in executing the DS1).

```ad-important
A buyer purchasing a property with a new mortgage will be registered as the proprietor, but the seller’s mortgage will remain on the title until evidence of discharge is provided, and the buyer’s mortgage will rank in priority behind the seller’s mortgage on the register.
```

Where there is a restriction on the register preventing a disposal or the registration of a new charge without the consent of the existing lender, proof of satisfaction of the charge or evidence of compliance with the restriction must be provided to Land Registry within **20 working days** (which can be extended to 40 working days on application); if this is not done, Land Registry will cancel the buyer’s applications for discharge, transfer and charge.

### Transfer of Whole

Application for registration of the dealing on Form AP1, accompanied by the relevant documents, should be lodged within **30 working days** of the date of issue of the applicant’s pre-completion official search certificate. Originals not needed; certified copies can be sent. Fee payable. Send:

1. Certified copy of the transfer
2. Appropriate fee
3. Copy of grant of representation if seller was PR
4. Certified copy power of attorney
5. SDLT certificate
6. Form DI
7. Office copy of appropriate death certificate if a registered proprietor has died.

### Additional Applications

May be associated applications to be made to Land Registry:

#### Application to Discharge Mortgage

If lender used ED system, Form AP1 should be endorsed with the words: "Charge discharged electronically". If using a paper form, buyer's solicitor applies to Land Registry for the charge to be discharged and a certified copy of the paper form of discharge submitted.

#### Application to Register New Legal Charge

If there is a new mortgage over the property, this must be registered. Submit:

1. Certified copy of the mortgage deed; and
2. If borrower is a company:
	1. Certified copy of the certificate of registration
	2. Conveyancer's/ lender's written confirmation that the certified copy mortgage deed being lodged for registration is the same as that filed at Companies House.

### Disclosing Overriding Interests

Applicant for registration must complete Form DI setting out any overriding interests that burden the title. These will be entered on the register and cease to be overriding.

### Identity Requirements

Applicant must give details of the conveyancer acting for each party. If a party is not represented, evidence of the party's identity must be provided.
