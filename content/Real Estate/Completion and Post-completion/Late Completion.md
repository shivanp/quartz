# Late Completion

Completion may be delayed:

- Problem in the chain of transactions
- Seller's solicitor not managing to get transfer deed signed by their client
- Buyer not being in receipt of funds from lender.
- Usually just a temporary hitch.

## Breach of Contract

The innocent party will be entitled to damages for his loss, but cannot terminate the contract unless time was of the essence of the completion date ([[Raineri v Miles [1981] AC 1050]]). SCPC 9.1.1: time is not of the essence unless a notice to complete has been served.

## Related Transactions

A solicitor should try to ensure that no breach of contract occurs (e.g., by arranging bridging finance to complete on time), but the overriding duty is to act in their client's best interest. Consider practicalities – cost of bridging finance, risk completion may take a while, client becoming “homeless”.

## Compensation for Delay

Damages payable under normal contractual principles for delayed completion. SCPC 10.3: payment of compensation for delayed completion irrespective of whether the relevant party has suffered any loss. Where loss has been suffered in excess of the amount payable under SCPC 10.3, can be recovered in a claim for breach of contract.

SCPC 10.3: Contractual entitlement to compensation given to the seller where the buyer has defaulted in some way and completion is delayed. If the seller defaults and completion is delayed, there is no contractual right to compensation (so the buyer would have to bring a claim for breach of contract to recover).

### Deemed Late Completion

SCPC 9.1.2/ 9.1.3: where the sale is with vacant possession and the money due on completion is not paid by 2pm on the day of actual completion, for the purposes of compensation, completion is deemed to have taken place the next working day (unless seller has not vacated by 2pm).

```ad-example
If buyer's money did not arrive until 2.15pm on Friday,seller would be entitled to interest for 3 days. 
```

## Service of Notice to Complete

When it appears a delay in completion is not likely to be resolved quickly, consideration may be given to the service of a notice to complete, with the effect of making time of the essence of the contract. Then the aggrieved party has the option to terminate the contract immediately.

```ad-warning
Making time of the essence imposes a condition which binds both parties. So if previously aggrieved party $A$ makes time of the essence, and subsequently is unable to complete, $B$ could then terminate the contract at the specified new completion date.
```

SCPC 9.8: on service of a notice to complete, completion must take place within 10 working days (exclusive of the date of service) and time is of the essence.

### Standard Conditions

- SCPC 9.8: on service of a notice to complete, completion must take place within 10 working days (excluding date of service) and makes time of the essence.
- SCPC 9.8.3: a buyer who has paid $<10\%$ deposit must pay the balance of the full 10% on receipt of a notice to complete.
- SCPC 10.5, 10.6: parties' rights and obligations where a valid notice has been served but not complied with. Once served, cannot be withdrawn.

Non-compliance with a notice to complete gives the aggrieved party the right to terminate the contract.

SCPC 10.5: as well as rescinding the contract, the seller may:

1. forfeit and keep the deposit and any accrued interest;
2. resell the property included in the contract; and
3. claim damages.

SCPC 10.6: in addition to rescinding the contract, the buyer is entitled to the return of the deposit and accrued interest.
