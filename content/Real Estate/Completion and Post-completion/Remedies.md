# Remedies

Sometimes completion is delayed/ cannot occur at all. Or the buyer may discover an incumbrance which has not been disclosed.

## Breach of Contract

Warranties, conditions, innominate terms. In conveyancing contracts, all terms are usually called conditions, but in law some of them will only be warranties. **The classification attached to a term by the parties is not conclusive as to its status.**

### Limitation Periods

6 years for breach of contract, 12 years where contract made by deed (Limitation Act 1980).

### Merger

On completion, the terms of the contract merge with the transfer deed in so far as the two documents cover the same ground. SCPC 10.4 is a non-merger clause to prevent this.

### Exclusion Clauses

SCPC 10.1 restricts the remedies available for a breach of contract. Buyer entitled to damages only if there is a material difference in the tenure/ value of the property. Entitled to terminate contract only if the error/ omission results from fraud/ recklessness or where otherwise obliged to accept property differing substantially in quality, quantity or tenure from expectations.

> [!example]
> So the buyer is only entitled to damages for an undisclosed incumbrance if this caused a material difference in the value of the land. 

Exclusion clauses contained in contracts for the sale of land (except those relating to the exclusion of liability for misrepresentation) are not subject to the reasonableness test in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.

### Damages

Damages for breach of a contract for the sale of land are assessed under the normal  
contractual principles established in [[Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341]].

![[Causation, remoteness, mitigation#Remoteness]]

### Quantum

Under consequential loss head, the quantum of damages limited to loss which was within the contemplation of the parties in the light of the facts known at the date when the contract was made (not at the date of the breach of contract).

Loss of development profit can be claimed only if D was aware of the claimant's proposals for the property at the time the contract was made.

### Loss of Development Profit

Claimable only if the defendant was aware of the claimant’s proposals for the property at the time the contract was made ([[Diamond v Campbell Jones [1961] Ch 22]]).

### Resale by Seller

Where the buyer defaults and the seller makes a loss on the resale, the loss can be claimed as damages. If the seller makes a profit on the resale, will have to give credit for the amount of the profit in his claim. **Seller not entitled to benefit from the buyer's breach**.

### Mental Distress

Lol, you can't recover for this (buying a house isn't a leisure activity like [[Jarvis v Swan Tours [1973] QB 233]]).

### Pre-contract Losses

Generally, no possibility of recovering expenses incurred at pre-contract stages of the transaction.

### Mitigation

![[Causation, remoteness, mitigation#Mitigation]]

## Rescission

Restoration of parties to their pre-contract position by undoing the contract and balancing the position of the parties with the payment of compensation. Conventional damages are not payable because there is no breach of contract. Equitable remedy (clean hands, lapse of time etc.)

### Contractual Right to Rescind

Right to rescind is available:

1. for misrepresentation (SCPC 10.1);
2. where a licence to assign is not forthcoming in leasehold transactions (SCPC 11.3);
3. where either the buyer or the seller has failed to comply with a notice to complete (SCPC 10.5 and 10.6).

### Limitation Periods

Where the right to rescind arises out of a contractual provision, must be exercised within time limits/ within a reasonable time.

## Misrepresentation

A misrepresentation is an untrue statement of fact made by one contracting party which is relied on by the aggrieved party, which induces him to enter the contract, and as a result of which he suffers loss. The statement must be of fact, not law ([[Solle v Butcher [1950] 1 KB 671]]). A statement of opinion is not actionable unless it can be proved that the opinion was never genuinely held ([[Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459]]).

### Fraudulent Misrepresentation

The aggrieved party may issue a claim in tort for deceit, which may result in rescission of the contract and damages. V onerous to prove.

### Claims Under Misrepresentation Act 1967

In relation to contracts between ‘consumers’ and ‘traders’ regulated by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (see 18.9), s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 does not apply to the extent that the consumer has a right to redress under Part 4A of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. These Regulations prohibit traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices when dealing with consumers.

For consumer-to-consumer or business-to-business contracts, claimant must show an actionable misrepresentation, after which the burden of proof shifts to D must disprove negligence. Misrepresentation is negligent if D cannot prove (1) reasonable grounds for believing and (2) did believe the statement he made was true up to the time the contract was made.

Remedies: rescission of contract and damages.

If D successfully establishes the defence, showing the misrepresentation was innocent, rescission is available but not damages.

### Rescission

Award of rescission lies within the equitable jurisdiction of the courts. Discretionary remedy subject to equitable bars. The court may award damages in lieu of rescission to the Claimant (s 2(2) Misrepresentation Act 1967). Likely to be awarded only where the result of misrepresentation is substantially to deprive claimant of his bargain. Available after completion, though may not be possible where a third party (e.g., lender) has acquired an interest.

### Damages

Damages under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 are awarded on a tortious basis ([[Chesneau v Interhome Ltd (1983) The Times, 9 June]]). An award of damages can be made both as an award in lieu of rescission and as an award to compensate the claimant for his loss, subject to the overriding principle that the claimant cannot recover more than his actual loss.

### Limitation Period

Claim for misrepresentation does not arise out of contract or tort. Limitation period subject to judicial debate, but in [[Green v Eadie and others [2011] EWHC B24 (Ch)]], the High Court held that a claim for damages under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 should become statute barred six years from when the cause of action accrued.

### Incorporation as a Term

s 1 Misrepresentation Act 1967: where a misrepresentation has become incorporated as a term of the contract, it is possible to treat the statement as a representation and to pursue a Misrepresentation Act remedy. Can allow claimant the right to ask for rescission as well as damages.

### Imputed Knowledge

Knowledge gained by a solicitor in the course of a transaction is deemed to be known by the solicitor’s client, whether or not this is in fact the case.

> [!example]
> Where a solicitor gives an incorrect reply to pre-contract enquiries, the solicitor’s knowledge, and also their misstatement, is attributable to the client who w ill be liable to the buyer in misrepresentation ([[CEMP Properties (UK) Ltd v Dentsply Research and Development Corporation (No 1) (1989) 2 EGLR 192]]). In such a situation, the solicitor would be liable to their own client in negligence.

### Exclusion Clauses

For consumer-to-consumer and business-to-business contracts, s 3 Misrepresentation Act 1967 provides that any clause which purports to limit or exclude liability for misrepresentation is valid only in so far as it satisfies the reasonableness test laid down in s 11 and Sch 2 UCTA 1977. For contracts between traders and consumers, the relevant test is the fairness test in s 62 CRA 2015. If a clause is unfair, it will not be binding on the consumer.

SCPC 10.1 purport to limit the seller's liability for misrepresentation. Damages only payable if there is a material difference between the property as represented and in reality.

**Special condition 2 SCPCs**: intended to prevent reliance on any misrepresentation which is not in writing and made by the other party/ solicitor, while preserving liability for fraud or recklessness.

## Mis-description and Non-disclosure

Where an error is made in the particulars of sale of the contract/ seller fails to comply with duty of disclosure, **SCPC 10.1** deals with remedies.

## Specific Performance

Equitable remedy granted at the discretion of the court. Order for specific performance not uncommon in sale of land cases where an award of damages would be inadequate. Equitable bars apply, so will not be awarded where:

1. Damages adequate compensation
2. Vitiating element like mistake, fraud or illegality
3. 3rd party has acquired an interest for value in the property
4. Seller cannot make good title.

The doctrine of laches (lapse of time) applies to equitable remedies.

If, in a situation where specific performance would otherwise be available to the injured party, the court decides not to make such an order, it can award damages in lieu of specific performance under the **s 50 SCA 1981**. Damages assessed on normal contractual principles. Where an award of specific performance has been made but has not been complied with, the injured party may return to the court asking the court to withdraw the order and to substitute the decree of specific performance with an award of damages ([[Johnson v Agnew [1980] AC 367]]).

## Return of Deposit

Where the buyer defaults on completion, the seller will want to forfeit the deposit, but **s 49(2) LPA 1925** gives the court an absolute discretion to order the return of the deposit to the buyer. Where the seller defaults on completion, the buyer will have a right to the return of the deposit under **SCPC 10.6**.

## Rectification

An application for rectification of the contract to correct the error can be made. s 2(4) LP(MP)A 1989: court has discretion to determine the date on which the contract comes into operation.

Where a term of the contract is either omitted from or inaccurately represented in the transfer deed, an application for rectification of the deed may be made to the court.

## Covenants for Title

Certain covenants for title will be implied into the transfer deed. The State guarantee of a registered title means that, in practice, claims on the covenants are unlikely to occur with the transfer of registered land.
