# Simple Transaction

## Stages

3 stages to a typical conveyancing transaction:

1. Pre-contract stage
2. Post-contract stage
3. Post-completion stage.

It is unreasonable usually to expect the transaction to take less than 6-8 weeks, due to delays caused by parties over whom the solicitor has no control.

In commercial transactions, the available time can be much shorter.

## Outline

### Marketing a Property

Put the property on the market in the hope of finding a buyer.

Once a buyer is found and price agreed, the conveyancing process can begin.

### Taking Instructions

All SRA regulated firms must comply with SRA Transparency Rules 2018, requiring them to publish price and service information for certain areas of law on their website.

One of these areas is residential conveyancing. Detailed cost information is required, such as the total cost of the service (or the average cost or range of costs), the basis for the charges, including any hourly rates or fixed fees, a description of, and the cost of, any likely disbursements (or the average cost or range of costs) and whether any fees or disbursements attract VAT.

Instructions must be taken. These should be confirmed to the client in writing, together with written information relating to the costs.

Obtain proof of client identity.

### Pre-contract Stage

Prepare the pre-contract package for the buyer. Include:

- Draft contract
- Evidence of seller's legal title to the property
- Results of pre-contract searches and other information about the property.
- Other items such as copy local authority planning permissions.

Although the seller has a limited duty to disclose defects in legal title, *caveat emptor* principle applied (“let the buyer beware”).

### Title

The buyer should check proof of ownership sent by the seller. Resolve queries through 'requisitions'. These are questions or requests addressed to the seller, requiring them to resolve any apparent problems with the seller's ownership, or 'title'.

> [!warning]
> The contract normally includes a clause excluding the buyer from questioning the seller's title once contracts for sale and purchase have been entered into. 

### Searches

Caveat emptor makes pre-contract searches necessary. Double check everything.

The National Land Information Service (NLIS) provides an Internet-based ‘one-stop shop’, enabling information kept by a variety of public and other bodies to be accessed more efficiently and speedily than by requesting the information

separately from each individual body.

### Buyer's Finances

The buyer's solicitor must check the client is able to proceed with the transaction.

The client must also be able to fund the deposit which traditionally is payable on entering into a contract to buy land. Traditionally, this was 10% of the purchase price and a sum that lenders would expect the buyer to provide separately to the amount advanced under the mortgage. N.B. can be 5% for a first time buyer of a residential property.

### Draft Contract

Once the draft contract has been agreed, it is prepared for the client's signature. Two copies: the buyer signs one and the seller signs another. These are then exchanged.

> [!tip]
> Prior to physical exchange, which is effected through the post, it is usual for the parties to agree over the telephone that the contract should come into existence at the moment of the  telephone call. This is often referred to as ‘telephonic exchange’.

### Exchange of Contracts

The exchange of contracts marks the stage in the transaction at which a binding contract comes into existence.

Note that this is widely criticised: that up until this point (which could be weeks or months into the transaction), either party could withdrawal at the last minute.

### Post-contract

Although it is often necessary for the buyer to insure the property on exchange, the first step is normally for the buyer to ‘raise requisitions’ with the seller. Historically, the purpose of requisitions was to clarify any queries which had arisen out of the seller’s proof of ownership of the property, but in modern conveyancing, where proof of title is invariably a pre-contract issue, requisitions are more likely to be directed at the resolution of procedural queries relating to the mechanics of completion itself.

### Draft Transfer Deed

Although it was the seller’s solicitor’s duty to prepare the contract, customarily it was the buyer’s solicitor who prepared the transfer deed itself. However, it is increasingly common for the contract to provide that the seller will draft the transfer. This will then be provided to the

buyer at the same time as the draft contract. This can help to prevent delays between exchange and completion.

> [!note]
> The contract states what the parties have agreed to do; the transfer deed
> carries it out. In other words, the transfer deed activates the terms of the contract and brings
> them alive.

The transfer deed can then be ‘engrossed’, i.e., a copy is prepared containing any agreed amendments; this is the copy which will be signed by the parties.

#### Signing

The seller must always sign the transfer deed, otherwise the legal estate in the land will not pass. Usually the buyer also signs, but there are circumstances in which it is not necessary for him to do so.

### Buyer's Lender

The lender needs to be certain that the property which it is accepting as security for the loan has a good title. Also, paperwork to do regarding mortgage.

### Acting for Buyer or Lender

> [!question] Is it a conflict of interest to act as solicitor for both the buyer and the buyer's lender?
> 
> Frequently, in a residential transaction, the solicitor who is acting for the buyer will also be instructed to act for the buyer’s lender. Acting for more than one party in a transaction is restricted by para 6.2 of the SRA Codes of Conduct, but acting for buyer and lender in a residential transaction is usually  permitted.

#### Buyer's Lender's Solicitor

The solicitor who is acting for the

buyer’s lender must:

1. draw up the mortgage deed for signature by the borrower (buyer);
2. certify to the lender that the legal title to the property is in order (a report on title); and
3. obtain a clear bankruptcy search against the borrower, since the lender will be reluctant to lend money to a person who is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings.

#### Buyer's Solicitor

- Ensure they put in funds to complete the transaction.
- The seller’s solicitor will have informed them of the exact amount of money needed to complete the transaction, either in answer to the buyer’s requisitions or on a separate document called a ‘completion statement’.
- The money which the client has to pay the solicitor to make up the balance due on completion must be paid to the solicitor in sufficient time before completion to allow that money to be cleared before the solicitor uses that money to complete the transaction.
	- Though usually the mortgage balance is transferred directly to the solicitor's bank account.

### Discharge of Seller's Mortgage

- The seller’s solicitor must now confirm with the seller’s lender the exact amount of money which is required to discharge the seller’s mortgage (usually referred to as the ‘redemption figure’), and generally make sure that they have in their possession all the documents required to complete the transaction.
- This may involve the preparation of a form of discharge of the seller’s mortgage if (as is usual) the seller’s solicitor is also acting for the seller’s lender in connection with the discharge.

### Completion

It is more common today for the parties to agree to complete ‘through the post’. In effect, a postal completion means that the seller’s solicitor is temporarily appointed to be the agent for the buyer’s solicitor, and while acting as such must

carry out all the steps which the buyer’s solicitor instructs them to do.

The method by which completion is to be effected will have been agreed by the respective solicitors at the ‘requisitions’ stage of the transaction. If a postal completion is to take place, the time at which completion is due will have been agreed in the course of a telephone

conversation between the parties’ solicitors, and the buyer’s solicitor will have given the seller’s solicitor precise instructions as to what is required to be done. This is in accordance with the guidelines for postal completions issued by The Law Society (the ‘Code for

Completion by Post’).

On the morning of completion day, the first priority is to transmit to the seller’s solicitor the money which is required to complete the transaction.

With a postal completion, the money is usually sent to the seller’s solicitor’s bank account by an electronic transmission of funds from the buyer’s solicitor’s bank account to the seller’s solicitor’s account.

When the seller’s solicitor’s bank receives the funds from the buyer’s solicitor’s bank, the bank should notify the seller’s solicitor that the funds have arrived, so that the seller’s solicitor can proceed with completion itself. In practice, this is little more than a formality.

The clients themselves do not attend completion, but should be informed by telephone immediately after completion that it has taken place.

### Post-completion

Seller's solicitor:

- Must send to the seller’s lender the amount required to pay off the seller’s mortgage, obtain a receipt for that money and send the receipt to the buyer’s solicitor, who will need this receipt to prove to Land Registry that the mortgage has been discharged.
- Account to their client for the proceeds of sale and, if not already done, prepare and submit their bill of costs.
- A solicitor who delays in returning money to a client may have to pay interest on that sum to the client under the SRA Accounts Rules 2019.

Buyer's solicitor:

- Deal with the payment of stamp duty land tax (SDLT).
	- Where SDLT is payable, it must usually be paid within 14 days of completion; failure to pay within this time attracts fines and penalties.
- Particulars of the transaction (i.e., who has sold what to whom and at what price) must be delivered to HMRC after completion in the form of a land transaction return.
	- A certificate is then issued by HMRC as proof that these requirements have been complied with. Without this certificate it is not possible to register the transaction at Land Registry.
	- Without registration the buyer will not acquire legal ownership to the property
- The buyer’s solicitor must apply to Land Registry for their client’s title to be registered.
	- Land Registry will provide the buyer with a Title Information Document.
	- This should be forwarded after checking by the solicitor to the lender or buyer for safekeeping.

## Linked Transactions

Often when the client is moving house, they will be using the sale proceeds to buy the new house (but also doesn't want to sell until she has bought the new one).

So the sale and purchase transactions should be synchronised. Failure to achieve synchronisation will prima facie be negligence on the part of the solicitor.

## Conveyancing Quality Scheme

In 1990, The Law Society issued the first edition of the National Protocol for residential conveyancing. The Protocol was designed to standardise the conveyancing process, using uniform documentation under the brand logo ‘TransAction’.

A new version, entitled ‘The Law Society Conveyancing Protocol’, was issued in 2011 and updated in 2019. All firms that undertake residential conveyancing and want to be members of The Law Society’s TransAction – Conveyancing Quality Scheme (CQS) are required to sign up to comply with the Protocol, a Client Service Charter, and mandatory training and enforcement procedures. Membership of CQS is essential for any firm wanting to be on the panels of solicitors approved by the residential mortgage lenders to act for lenders where the buyer is taking out a  
residential mortgage.
