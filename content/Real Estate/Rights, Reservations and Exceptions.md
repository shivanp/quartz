# Rights, Reservations and Exceptions

The rights granted to a tenant and the matters reserved to the landlord/ excepted from the grant are part of the description of the property. These are very important and can have an impact at rent review.

## Ancillary Rights Granted to the Tenant

### New Rights and Easements

- On the grant of a lease, new easements benefitting the demised property may be created without express grant:
	- [[Wheeldon v Burrows (1879) 12 Ch. D. 31]]
	- Common intention of the parties
	- s 62 LPA 1925
- This could unexpectedly limit the landlord's use of the retained land.
- So it is sensible to contract to prevent the creation of new easements, and provide that any new rights and easements must be expressly granted.
	- Carefully consider right to light
	- Give the tenant rights over common parts (e.g., use of communal toilets, parking in designated spaces).
- Extent to which these rights are needed depends on the nature of the property demised.

Important to both landlord and tenant that all relevant rights are granted:

| Party    | Importance                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Landlord | Not including rights could have an adverse effect at rent review. Failure to seek contribution to maintenance costs would leave the landlord with a cash shortfall. |
| Tenant   | Wants to be sure it has rights necessary to use the property for its business and comply with its covenants under the lease.                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Existing Rights and Easements

An easement which is already in existence over 3rd party land passes automatically on a disposition of the estate, without express mention. This position is not altered by s 62.

The benefit of a right of way appurtenant to land passes to the tenant of that land without express mention ([[Skull v Glenister (1864) 16 CB (NS) 81]]). However, it is possible to include provisions in the lease to prevent the passing of the benefit of some or all existing easements or other appurtenant rights.

### Investigating Title to Rights

If existing rights are to be enjoyed by the tenant, the tenant should investigate title to ensure they are capable of passing and sufficient for the tenant's needs. The tenant should also investigate the landlord's title to grant new rights in the same manner.

### Registration

Easements expressly granted in a lease after 13/10/03 must be completed by registration in the case of a registered estate. If the easements are not registered, they only take effect in equity.

> [!warning]
> Easements expressly granted in a lease must be registered to be effective, even ifi the lease itself is incapable of registration. 

## Rights Excepted and Reserved

Exceptions and reservations deal with rights benefitting the landlord:

- Easements benefitting any neighbouring property belonging to the landlord (must have a dominant and servient tenement to create an easement: [[London & Blenheim Estates Ltd v Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd [1992] ]]).
- Rights enabling the landlord to develop a neighbouring property without interference
- Rights assisting the landlord in ensuring the tenant complies with the terms of the lease.

> [!defn] Exception
> Something that exists and is (or would be) part of the thing granted, but which is excluded from the grant (for example, mineral rights).

> [!defn] Reservation
> Something that is not in existence at the date of the grant but which arises out of the demise.

Sometimes a right over the property in favour of the landlord, such as a right of way, is technically in the nature of a new grant by the tenant to the landlord. But in practice no one cares.

> [!question] How widely should reservations be interpreted?
> _[Rees v Windsor-Clive [2020] EWCA Civ 816](https://uk.westlaw.com/D-105-0126?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=8480f1faa9a046d89d64dd6a4fb84a19)_: reservations are not always to be given their narrowest possible interpretation. In every case, it is a question of interpreting the clause in question in its context. If rights of entry are reserved for reasonable purposes, which is a very common formulation, the derogation from grant principle does not require the court to give a right of entry the narrowest possible interpretation.

### Common Exceptions and Reservations

- Right to light
	- Landlords often reserve a right to light for the benefit of land owned by the landlord.
	- A right of light can be acquired by prescription against a freehold while the dominant land is let. It is for this reason that landlords usually except the right to build on land adjoining the let property.
	- Effect: the flow of light to the property is enjoyed with the consent of the landlord, so a prescriptive right to light cannot be acquired by the landlord.
- Right of support and protection
	- Rights of support and protection are often reserved, depending on the nature of the let property.
- Reservations to correspond to rights granted
	- Where the leases of other parts of the building grant rights over the let property, corresponding reservations are needed.
- Rights in relation to works and development.
	- Rights in relation to the landlord's ability to carry out works on neighbouring property are reserved in appropriate cases.
	- Tenant will be concerned for the potential of disruption
		- Tenant will try to have the term qualified that the landlord cannot carry out the works in a way which materially adversely affects the tenant's use of the property.
		- Courts hold that redevelopment rights are construed restrictively, with reference to the landlord's covenant for quiet enjoyment.
- Rights of entry to the property
	- The landlord will usually reserve a right to enter onto the property for a broad range of purposes at any reasonable time and after reasonable notice.
	- This reservation usually excludes liability for any damage the landlord causes to the property.
	- Tenant may request reasonable timescale provision/ due care exercised when entering/ broadening of landlord's liability through any damage to its belongings.
	- Provisions of UCTA 1977 relating to exclusion clauses do not apply to contracts for the creation, transfer or termination of an interest in land (Sch 1, UCTA).

## Third Party Rights

Encumbrances which affect the property at the date of grant of the lease.

Where a right in favour of a third party already exists over the property for the benefit of neighbouring land not owned by the landlord, the lease will be granted subject to that right.

### Tenant Concerns

The tenant may be concerned by the possible existence of undisclosed encumbrances, especially undisclosed overriding interests and restrictive covenants.

Whilst the tenant will, as a matter of law, generally take subject to these, there may be costs or other obligations associated with them, and leases often include a covenant by the tenant to comply with all obligations relating to the third party rights. They may also affect the ability of the tenant to use the property for the permitted use.

The tenant must usually rely on the information provided by the landlord and its inspection of the property.

The disclosure of third party rights also limits any title guarantee given by the landlord.

## Code for Leasing Business Premises, E&W 2020

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' (RICS) Professional statement, _[Code for Leasing Business Premises, England and Wales (1st edition, February 2020)](https://www.rics.org/globalassets/code-for-leasing_ps-version_feb-2020.pdf)_ (Lease Code 2020) (effective from 1 September 2020) contains a mixture of mandatory requirements and best practice.

It provides that:

1. The agreement as to terms of the lease on a vacant possession letting must be recorded in written heads of terms.
2. The tenant should be granted all rights necessary for the intended use of the premises.
