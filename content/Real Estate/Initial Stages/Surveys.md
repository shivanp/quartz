# Surveys

## When to Survey

A valuation will be undertaken by the buyer’s lender in order to establish whether the property  
being purchased will be adequate security for the amount of the loan. The buyer pays the cost  
of this valuation and is usually permitted to see the valuer’s report. But the valuation just assesses the value of the property. If the lender has concerns about the condition of the property, it may insist on a full survey as a condition of the mortgage offer.

The caveat emptor rule places on the buyer the onus of discovering any physical faults in the  
property agreed to be sold. For this reason alone, a survey is always advisable in order to  
discover physical defects which are not readily apparent on inspection of the property by the  
lay client.

## Types

From June 2020, surveyors undertaking residential surveys should be offering standardised  
forms of survey at three differing levels of detail (and therefore cost)–level 1 is the cheapest and least thorough.

Surveys of commercial properties are not standardised in the same way as residential surveys  
and the extent of the survey will depend on the scope of the instructions. The client might be reminded that incurring the cost of a survey is preferable to discovering that many thousands of pounds need to be spent on carrying out structural repairs to the property he has just purchased without the benefit of a survey.

## Additional Surveys

- Drainage survey
- Environmental survey
- Asbestos survey
	- Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/632) impose a duty to identify and manage asbestos in non-domestic buildings.

## Flats

Where the property to be purchased is a flat or is a property which is structurally attached to  
a neighbouring property, a full survey is desirable.

Ask about fire safety and any combustible cladding.

## Surveyor's Liability

The surveyor owes a duty of care to their client to carry out their survey with reasonable skill and care. This common law duty is reinforced by statutory provisions which imply into a contract for services a term that the work will be carried out with reasonable skill and care (see [[Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982]], s 13 and [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]], s 49(1)).

Where the client suffers loss after having relied on a lender’s valuer’s report, a claim in tort may lie against the surveyor. No claim in contract can be sustained because the survey was commissioned by the lender, and so there is no contractual relationship between the buyer and the surveyor. The success of such a claim may again depend on the validity of any exclusion clause contained in the valuation. However, it was held by the House of Lords in [[Smith v Eric Bush [1990] 1 AC 831]] that a valuer instructed by a lender to carry out a mortgage valuation of a modest house, in the knowledge that the buyer would rely on the valuation without obtaining an independent survey, owed a duty of care to the buyer to exercise reasonable care and skill in carrying out the valuation.
