# Drafting Leases

## Drafting and Approval

Typically, a lease will include provisions relating to:

1. the description of the premises to be let;
2. the easements to be granted and reserved;
3. the arrangements for repair, maintenance and other services;
4. the provisions for payment of the service charge (if any);
5. the insurance arrangements;
6. the restrictions on the use to which the premises may be put;
7. any restrictions on assignment and sub-letting;
8. any restrictions on the making of alterations and improvements;
9. enforcement of covenants; and
10. the provisions for rent and rent review.

The draft lease is produced by the landlord's solicitor, usually by reference to a precedent. The lease should favour the client but still be fair. The tenant's solicitor then approves the draft lease, following negotiation.

### Land Registry Prescribed Clauses

The LRA 2002 empowered Land Registry to prescribe a form of lease which would have to be  
used in all cases where the lease was registrable, which it decided against. The Land Registration (Amendment) (No 2) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/1982) provide that certain leases must contain prescribed clauses – namely those dated on/ after 19/06/06 which are granted out of registered land and are compulsorily registrable.

A lease will not, however, be a prescribed clauses lease if it arises out of a variation of a lease  
which is a deemed surrender and re-grant, or if it is granted in a form expressly required by  
any of the following:

1. an agreement entered into before 19 June 2006;
2. a court order;
3. an enactment; and
4. a necessary consent or licence for the grant of the lease given before 19 June 2006.

> [!defn] Prescribed clauses leases
> A lease for which use of the prescribed clauses is compulsory. 

> [!action]
> If an applicant claims that a lease is not a prescribed clauses lease due to one of these exceptions, a conveyancer’s certificate or other evidence must be supplied with the application for registration.

Prescribed clauses must appear at the beginning of a lease. Sch 1A Land Registration Rules 2003 sets out the required wording of prescribed clauses and gives instructions as to how the prescribed clauses must be completed.

## Contents

### Commencement

The lease starts with the words ‘This lease’, followed by the date of its grant (date of completion), and the names and addresses of the parties.

### Payment of Premium and Receipt

For a long lease of residential property, a premium is charged for the grant of the lease. Consideration and receipt clauses must be included in the lease. The tenant's consideration for the grant consists of:

- Payment of the premium
- Payment of the rent
- Promise to perform lease covenants.

### Operative Words

“The Landlord hereby demises/ grants/ leases/ lets”

### Title Guarantee

After the operative words: “with full/ limited title guarantee”. Any express modifications of the covenants also included.

### Term

Take care when setting the commencement date of the term. This can be set at an earlier date than the actual start of the lease.

> [!warning]
> - "from 1st November" means the lease starts on 2nd November. 
> - "from and including 1st November" means the lease starts on 1st November. 

### Parcels Clause

- Must be possible to say with certainty what is and is not being let.
- Particularly consider walls/ floors/ ceilings in a shared building – who owns the wall could determine who must fix it.
- For a top-floor flat, is the roof space and area above it included in the letting? If yes, tenant may be able to extend upwards, but may have to pay for roof repairs.
- Car parking
	- If a specific car parking space is allocated, this should be included in the property let to the tenant.
	- If there is just the right to park somewhere in a car park, this will be an easement.

#### Easements Granted

- Access and services
	- Consider any ancillary rights benefitting the property.
	- Rights of way for utilities and cables.
- Access for repair
	- Right of access to inspect and repair/ replace pipes and cables.
- New rights
	- Make provision for the possible need to install new cables/ facilities.
- Use of toilets etc.
	- Use of any communal toilets in the building.
- Rubbish
	- Is there a communal bin? Right to use it?

Also ensure that reservations are made in favour of the other tenants and landlord.

## Key Covenants in Leases

![[leases 3_1.jpg]]

Four of the main covenants found in leases are introduced: repair, alterations, user, and alienation.

The basic rule is that a tenant may do all the things that an owner of an estate can do unless the lease prohibits such actions. For this reason, leases are drafted in a prohibitory or negative manner, setting out what the tenant cannot do by way of a number of tenant covenants. A lease will also contain covenants given by the landlord.

> [!defn] Leasehold covenant
> A promise contained in a lease given by a landlord or a tenant.

## Types of Covenant

In leasehold work you need to be able to distinguish between different types of covenant;

- Absolute
- Qualified
- Fully qualified

| Type of covenant         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Absolute covenant        | If there is an absolute covenant the tenant is completely prohibited from doing something (eg 'The Tenant shall not underlet part of the Premises'); the tenant is absolutely not able to underlet one of its rooms in its office block and will be at the mercy of the landlord, who will be able to consider or ignore any request to underlet part.                                |
| Qualified covenant       | If there is a qualified covenant (e.g. the Tenant shall not make any non-structural alterations to the Premises without the consent of the Landlord) then the tenant can go and ask the landlord for his consent, although the landlord does not have to give it! There are  statutes relating to user, alterations and alienation intervene with regard to such qualified covenants. |
| Fully qualified covenant | If there is a fully qualified covenant (e.g., the Tenant shall not make any internal, non-structural alterations to the Premises without the consent of the Landlord, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld’) the landlord has to be reasonable if he is going to withhold his consent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Reasonableness

The courts have considered the test of 'reasonableness’, especially in respect of cases on assignment, underletting and carrying out alterations.

[[International Drilling Fluids Ltd v Louisville Investments (Uxbridge) Ltd [1986] Ch 513]] stated the basic principles to be applied in determining the reasonableness of a landlord’s decision and made it clear that a landlord is not entitled to refuse his consent on grounds which have nothing to do with the landlord and tenant relationship.

> [!example]
> It would not be reasonable for a landlord to refuse consent on the basis that he did not like the proposed assignee, or he supported a different football team. It must be something to do with, for example, the proposed assignee’s ability to pay the rent or bad references.

## Alterations and Improvements

Unless the lease stipulates otherwise, the tenant is free to carry out any alterations to the premises, subject to the legal doctrine of 'waste' which prevents alterations which would devalue the premises.

However, the landlord will usually wish to control this by:

1. Limiting the type of alterations permitted (e.g., only allowing non-structural alterations and prohibiting structural alterations.)
2. Requiring the landlord’s approval or consent (licence) in order to do the alteration works.
3. Requiring reinstatement/removal of alterations at the end of the lease term.

Best to set out expressly in the lease. The landlord should consider the impact on property value of alterations and structural safety.

### Absolute Prohibitions

In a short-term lease, a landlord is likely to prohibit all alterations and impose an absolute covenant.

In a multi-occupied building, the landlord may have covenanted in the leases of the building that it will enforce the tenant's covenants at the request of another tenant. In these circumstances, the landlord would have to seek the permission of all tenants before giving permission to Tenant X to carry out alterations prohibited by the lease ([[Duval v 11-13 Randolph Crescent Ltd [2020] UKSC 18]]).

If the tenant agrees to an absolute covenant against alterations, the tenant will be at the mercy of the landlord, unless it can rely on an exception:

1. s 3 LTA 1927
	- If the tenant wants to carry out improvements, it can serve a notice on the landlord detailing its proposals
	- The landlord has 3 months within which to object, and if it does then the tenant has the right to apply to the court for authorisation to carry out the improvements.
	- The court can authorise the improvements if they add to the letting value of the property, are reasonable, and are suitable to the character of the property and do not diminish the value of any other property of the landlord.
	- Instead of objecting or consenting to the works, a landlord can offer to carry out the works itself in return for a reasonable increase in the rent (Landlord and Tenant Act 1927, s 3(1)).
	- A tenant is under no obligation to accept an offer by the landlord to carry out the works, and may withdraw its notice.
	- If the tenant rejects the landlord’s offer, the court cannot give the tenant authority to do the works itself ([[Norfolk Capital Group Ltd v Cadogan Estates Ltd [2004] EWHC 384 (Ch)]]).
	- If the landlord does not offer to carry out the works itself or object to the improvements within three months (or if the court authorises the work), then the tenant may lawfully carry them out, even if the lease prohibits the works.
2. Equality Act 2010
	- Provides for a regime of implied consents in relation to ‘reasonable adjustments’ required to meet the needs of those with disabilities.

### Qualified Prohibitions

A qualified covenant against alterations prohibits alterations without the landlord's prior consent. The [Landlord and Tenant Act (‘LTA’) 1927, s 19(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/36/section/19) applies to 'qualified' **alterations** covenants.

> [!statute] s 19(2) LTA 1927
> In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of this Act containing a covenant condition or agreement against the making of improvements without a licence or consent, such covenant condition or agreement shall be deemed, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary, to be **subject to a proviso that such licence or consent is not to be unreasonably withheld**; but this proviso does not preclude the right to require as a condition of such licence or consent the payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage to or diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises belonging to the landlord, and of any legal or other expenses properly incurred in connection with such licence or consent nor, in the case of an improvement which does not add to the letting value of the holding, does it preclude the right to require as a condition of such licence or consent, where such a requirement would be reasonable, an undertaking on the part of the tenant to reinstate the premises in the condition in which they were before the improvement was executed.

Where there is a qualified covenant against alteration then LTA 1927, s 19(2) implies into a qualified covenant against improvements a proviso that the landlord’s consent is not to be unreasonably withheld. It therefore **converts a qualified covenant against alterations that amount to improvements into a fully qualified one**.

#### Improvements

LTA 1927, s 19(2) only applies to 'improvements’. What then constitutes an ‘improvement?’

The leading case is [[Lambert v FW Woolworth & Co Limited [1938] Ch 833]] which held that 'improvements' are to be construed widely as works which improve the premises from the **tenant’s perspective**.

> [!tip]
> If the works will increase the value or usefulness of the premises to the tenant then they will constitute an improement, even if they result in a reduction in the value of the landlord's reversionary interest. 

LTA 1927, s 19(2) allows the landlord to require as a condition of giving consent:

- payment of compensation for loss in value to the reversion caused by the alterations;
- reinstatement of the premises if reasonable (at the end of the lease term);
- payment of the landlord’s expenses in giving consent.

The above conditions would usually be set out in the **Licence for Alterations** but, even if they are not, the landlord is still permitted to ask for them.

#### Practicalities

In practice, most commercial leases will allow certain alterations with the landlord’s consent not to be unreasonably withheld and expressly prohibit others (e.g., structural alterations). LTA 1927, s 19(2) does not apply to these covenants, which are already fully qualified.

LTA 1927, s 19(2) has no effect on absolute covenants. However, even though there may be an absolute covenant in the lease against, e.g., structural alterations, this does not preclude the landlord from granting a one-off consent to a particular structural alteration. This one-off consent would be documented in a Licence for Alterations. The landlord would be free to stipulate any conditions to such consent he wanted, and these would not be subject to any test of reasonableness.

#### Compensation

Part 1 LTA 1927 entitles a tenant of business premises to claim compensation for improvements at the end of the term that "add to the letting value of the holding". The tenant must have obtained prior authorisation to make the improvements using the s 3 statutory procedure. Rarely relevant since most leases contain a tenant's covenant to remove all alterations and reinstate the premises at the end of the term.

## Insurance

Could be the responsibility of the tenant or landlord to keep the property insured. For a letting of part, the management company usually insures the whole block.

Consider the following:

1. The risks insured against
	- The risks insured against should be expressly stated.
	- Common for the list of risks to conclude with "such other risks as the landlord may reasonably require/ the tenant may reasonably request".
2. Amount of cover
	- The property should be insured to its full reinstatement value, including:
		- Cost of demolition and site clearance
		- Professional fees
		- Allowance for inflation.
3. Application of policy monies.
	- Covenant by the landlord to use the proceeds to reinstate the premises.
	- Ideally for tenant, the landlord should covenant to make up any shortfall themselves.
	- What if reinstatement is impossible? Probably fairest to have a term splitting the insurance pay-out between the tenant and landlord.

### Rent Suspension

> [!warning]
> In the absence of an express term to the contrary, rent will continue to be payable even if the property is rendered unusable.

The tenant should ensure that the lease provides for the payment of rent to be suspended during any period that the premises cannot be occupied following damage by an insured risk.

### Termination

If the building is totally destroyed, it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the doctrine of frustration will apply and the lease will be terminated ([[National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd [1981] AC 675]]). The lease will usually give the landlord the right to determine the lease on notice if reinstatement is impossible. The tenant should try to give itself a similar right.

## Permitted User

A lease will often contain a tenant covenant relating to the use of the premises. A landlord will want control over what the tenant is to use the premises for, e.g., for residential use or a specific business purpose. A tenant may be able to change the use of the premises depending upon the type of covenant.

> [!action]
> When you are acting for a tenant, you should consider the user provisions carefully, to ensure that they are not going to cause your client any problems in his occupation of the unit, or if he should wish to assign the lease.

Both parties should consider any impact of competition legislation ([[Martin Retail Group Ltd v Crawley Borough Council (24 December 2013, Central London County Court)]]).

### Premium for Consent

[LTA 1927, s 19(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/36/section/19) applies to 'qualified' **user** covenants.

> [!statute] s 19(3) LTA 1927
> In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of this Act containing a covenant condition or agreement against the alteration of the user of the demised premises, without licence or consent, such covenant condition or agreement shall, if the alteration **does not involve any structural alteration** of the premises, be deemed, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary, to be subject to a proviso that **no fine or sum of money in the nature of a fine, whether by way of increase of rent or otherwise, shall be payable for or in respect of such licence or consent**; but this proviso does not preclude the right of the landlord to require payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage to or diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises belonging to him and of any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with such licence or consent. 

If the change of use does involve a change to the structure, the landlord can increase the rent or charge the tenant a lump sum (in the statute referred to as a 'fine' or 'premium') in return for the consent.

The landlord will be entitled to recover its costs and expenses involved in the application for consent, e.g., surveyor’s fees and legal fees.

> [!warning]
> There is no statutory implication that the landlord's consent cannot be unreasonably withheld. So a tenant would much prefer the covenant to be fully qualified. 

## Flats

In a lease of a flat, the landlord will usually want to ensure the block is solely for residential use (to preserve the value of the reversion). Such a covenant is usually acceptable to both landlords and tenants.

### Commercial Leases

Considerations:

- Having a good mix of retail units in a retail park
- Having only offices in an office block.
- The broadness of the user clause usually impacts the rent.
- Use Classes Order 1987 sets out different categories of uses, which can be used to specify the permitted uses.

## Repair

### Who Does What

> [!defn] "Full repairing lease"
> The tenant has full responsibility for the repair of the whole property - respondible for carrying out the repairs and bearing the cost. 

If the demised premises form part of a larger property, a "full repairing lease" places direct responsibility for repairing the demised premises on the tenant. It also makes the tenant indirectly responsible for the cost (or a proportion of the cost) of repairs to the structure, exterior and common parts of the property through the service charge.

- For a lease of a whole building, repairing obligations are usually imposed on the tenant
- Where a tenant has a lease of part, responsibility will be divided.
- Repairing obligations implied into short residential tenancies under Housing Act 1985, but this is not normally the case for longer residential leases/ leases of commercial property.

### Obligations by 3rd Parties

For flat leases, often a management company is used. Ensure the tenant is able to enforce these obligations (e.g., privity of contract, landlord and tenant grounds).

If repairing obligations are imposed on other tenants, check there is a covenant from the landlord that the landlord will enforce them against other tenants on request/ provisions of Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 apply.

### Who Pays

Usually the tenant, either directly or through a service charge.

### Extent of Obligation

Under a general repairing covenant, the tenant must, according to the Court of Appeal in [[Proudfoot v Hart (1890) LR 25 QBD 42]], keep the premises in the condition in which they would be kept by a reasonably minded owner, having regard to:

1. The character and type of premises at the beginning of the lease. The obligation is neither diminished nor increased by a change in the character of the neighbourhood.
2. The age of the premises.
3. The express words of the covenant.

Many leases require the tenant to keep the demised premises in "good repair", "good and tenantable repair" or "substantial repair". It is uncertain whether the additional words add anything to the obligation to "repair" and there is case law to suggest that generally they do not (_Proudfoot v Hart (1890) 25 QBD 42_). A covenant that requires the tenant to keep the property "in good repair and condition" is more onerous than one that specifies "good repair" alone.

> [!warning]
> **A covenant to keep the premises in repair also entails an obligation to put them in repair first**, if at the time of the letting they were out of repair ([[Proudfoot v Hart (1890) LR 25 QBD 42]]). Rationale: if the tenant covenants to keep property in repair, the tenant cannot perform this covenant unless the tenant first puts the property into repair (_[Payne v Haine [1847] 16 M&W 41](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-009-7105?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=47d8e69b58514ba1976c981efd5911b3)_). This can be a very onerous obligation if the premises are in a state of disrepair at the beginning of the term.

> [!action]
> Before taking the lease, the tenant should inspect the property (and the building of which it forms part) for disrepair and then assess the potential repair costs.

#### Schedule of Condition

If the tenant simply wants to maintain the premises in the condition they were in at the outset of the lease, the tenant can employ a surveyor to survey the premises and report on the state of repair prior to taking the lease. Then a schedule of condition (photographs and verbal description of the premises prepared by a surveyor) can be annexed to the lease prior to the grant and the repairing covenant can then refer to it as evidence of the state of repair. The repair obligation would refer to the schedule of condition by stating that the tenant is 'under no obligation to put the premises in any better state of repair than as evidenced by the schedule of condition annexed to the lease'. Beyond this, the tenant then has no obligation to the landlord.

A schedule of condition may be particularly important to an undertenant who is taking an underlease. The undertenant may argue that a full repairing obligation is inappropriate in these circumstances and that it is unreasonable to expect it to hand back the property in a better condition than it was in when the underlease was granted. This may require the superior landlord's consent if the superior lease stipulates that any underlease is to be on the same terms.

#### Inherent Defect

A defect in the design/ construction of the building, which existed on completion but was not apparent on inspection.

If the inherent defect does not cause damage, the tenant will not be required to remedy (_[Post Office v Aquarius Properties Limited [1987] 1 All ER 1055](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-009-7107?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=966adc813d44458ba2271293efe92ed6)_).

Particularly where the property is newly built, the tenant may wish to exclude liability for:

- Disrepair caused by inherent defects.
- Remedying the inherent defect itself.

“Inherent defect” should be defined specifically in the lease. The tenant's exclusion should be coupled with an obligation on the landlord to be responsible for such repairs (at its own cost, rather than through the service charge).

Alternatively, rather than agreeing to a limitation of the tenant's repairing liability, a landlord may offer the tenant direct warranties from the professional team, or third party rights.

#### Insured Risks

These are usually excluded from the tenant's repairing obligation.

But the tenant will normally be responsible for repairing damage caused by an insured risk if the insurance monies cannot be recovered because of an act or omission of the tenant.

#### Approval of Works

If the tenant's covenant requires repairs to be carried out to the satisfaction of the landlord's surveyor, the surveyor is entitled to prescribe the work to be carried out as well as the method of repair (_[Mason v Totalfinaelf UK [2003] 3 EGLR 91](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-009-7111?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=966adc813d44458ba2271293efe92ed6)_). Should usually be resisted by the tenant.

#### Repair Vs Renewal

A covenant to repair does not require renewal of the whole or substantially the whole of the property. It is a question of degree whether the work involves repair or renewal, but if the works constitute 'renewal' rather than 'repair', they will not fall within the tenant’s repair obligation.

Equally, “repair” does not extend as far as improvements. There is a risk that the landlord/ management company may decide to carry out large-scale improvements which tenants do not want/ need, at the tenant's expense.

Fair compromise: a clause to "improve and renew to the extent such renewals or improvements are necessary or desirable to keep the Building in good and substantial repair".

Before an obligation to repair can "bite", the property must be in disrepair. This means that the physical condition of the property must have deteriorated (_Post Office v Aquarius Properties Ltd [1987] 1 All ER 1055_).  

Where the tenant is responsible for carrying out repairs, it will normally be for the tenant to choose the method of repair.

#### Occupiers' Liability

look out for clauses which require the tenant to indemnify the landlord against any such claim under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957 by the tenant’s visitors.

#### Other Phrases

##### Good Condition

An obligation to keep the property in **good condition** can require works to be carried out even if there is no disrepair (e.g., installing insulation to a property suffering condensation, even where the property was not in disrepair - _[Welsh v Greenwich LBC (2001) 33 H.L.R. 40](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-008-7715?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=47d8e69b58514ba1976c981efd5911b3&comp=pluk)_).

It is also worth noting that sometimes an obligation to keep in good condition imposes a liability less than repair. In _[Firstcross Ltd v Teasdale [1983] 8 HLR 112](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-023-2581?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=47d8e69b58514ba1976c981efd5911b3)_, the High Court held that a tenant of a flat, who had covenanted to keep it in a good and a tenantable condition, was required to do no more than use the flat in a tenant-like manner.

##### To Maintain

Ambiguous:

- May require only maintenance of premises in the state they were in when demised.
- Or can be construed by reference to the purpose of the object requiring repair.

#### Physical State of Obligation

The scope of repairing obligation will coincide with the physical extent of the demised premises. Where the demised premises are part of a larger property, each tenant will be responsible for repairing its demised property and the landlord will maintain the exterior, structure and common parts.

> Ensure there is no overlap/ gap in repairing obligations, e.g., windows, ceilings. 

#### Mechanical, Electrical Services and Plant

If plant and machinery are annexed to the land and have become _[fixtures](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/8-202-2732?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=966adc813d44458ba2271293efe92ed6)_, the repairing obligations will apply to them.

Whether an object has become part of the land depends on the degree of annexation to the land (_[Elitestone Ltd v Morris and Another [1997] UKHL 15](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/D-000-1799?originationContext=document&transitionType=PLDocumentLink&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=966adc813d44458ba2271293efe92ed6)_) - fixtures vs fittings.

![[Fixtures]]

Plant and machinery:

- It may be sensible for the tenant to commission a mechanical and engineering consultant to carry out proper tests and report.
- Although a landlord should always seek to impose a covenant to repair the mechanical, electrical services and plant, under a conventional repair obligation, there is no requirement to carry out any works until there is damage or deterioration.

In addition to an obligation to repair, there is often:

- A covenant requiring maintenance
- A covenant to keep in working order/ keep in operating condition

Emphasis on practical function, not physical condition.

To make the clause more acceptable to a covenantor, the covenantee may be prepared to qualify the obligation by only requiring the covenantee to keep the mechanical, electrical services and plant so that they are capable of functioning in a manner to the covenantor's **reasonable** satisfaction.

### Breach of Repair Obligations

When a landlord enters into a repairing covenant, there will be no breach unless and until he has notice (no matter from what source) of the lack of repair.

> [!action]
> When acting for a landlord, you should include a tenant’s covenant to notify the landlord of the need to repair. If the tenant fails to do this, he will also be in breach of covenant and liable to the landlord for damages

If the part of the property in question is in the control of the landlord, for example the common parts, then the landlord’s liability does not depend upon his having received notice of the disrepair.

A “self-help” right is usually included: landlord's right to enter and effect any repairs not done by the tenant, and then recharge the cost to the tenant.

## Assignment and Sub-letting

Common law: a tenant is free to dispose of his properties, whether by outright assignment of the lease or by sublease.

### Flat Leases

Long-term flat lease: T will have paid a premium for the grant of the lease. Lease must be acceptable to any prospective mortgagee. Assignment of the whole usually permitted freely in this context, though there may be restrictions on assignment and subletting of part. Landlord will want to know the identity of new tenants, so often a covenant to register new dealings with the landlord and pay a fee.

### Commercial Leases

Far more restrictions - identity and status of the occupier matters. Parting with possession or sharing occupation is either prohibited or strictly controlled. This is wider than assignment/ sub-letting, but does not include the granting of a licence.

Usually assignment, sub-letting and/or sharing with group companies is allowed in circumstances, after this blanket ban.

### Qualified Prohibition

Absolute prohibition usually unacceptable to tenants. So there is usually a qualified/ fully qualified prohibition.

> [!important]
> A qualified covenant can be converted into a fully qualified covenant by the operation of s 19(1)(a) LTA 1927. 

The Landlord and Tenant Act 1988 further strengthened the position of a tenant seeking  
consent to assign, sub-let, charge or part with possession. The Act applies where the lease  
contains a fully qualified covenant against alienation (whether express or implied by statute). The Act still applies even if the fully qualified covenant is subject to s 19(1A) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927.

> [!statute] s 1 LTA 1988 - Qualified duty to consent to assigning, underletting etc. of premises.
> 
> (1) This section applies in any case where—
> - (a) a tenancy includes a covenant on the part of the tenant not to enter into one or more of the following transactions, that is—
> 	- (i) assigning,
> 	- (ii) underletting,
> 	- (iii) charging, or
> 	- (iv) parting with the possession of,
> - the premises comprised in the tenancy or any part of the premises without the consent of the landlord or some other person, but
> - (b) the covenant is subject to the qualification that the consent is not to be unreasonably withheld (whether or not it is also subject to any other qualification).
> 
> (2) In this section and section 2 of this Act—
> - (a) references to a proposed transaction are to any assignment, underletting, charging or parting with possession to which the covenant relates, and

> 
> (3) Where there is served on the person who may consent to a proposed transaction a written application by the tenant for consent to the transaction, he owes a duty to the tenant within a reasonable time—

> 
> (4) Giving consent subject to any condition that is not a reasonable condition does not satisfy the duty under subsection (3)(a) above.
> 
> (5) For the purposes of this Act it is reasonable for a person not to give consent to a proposed transaction only in a case where, if he withheld consent and the tenant completed the transaction, the tenant would be in breach of a covenant.
> 
> (6) It is for the person who owed any duty under subsection (3) above—
> - (a) if he gave consent and the question arises whether he gave it within a reasonable time, to show that he did,
> - (b) if he gave consent subject to any condition and the question arises whether the condition was a reasonable condition, to show that it was,
> - (c) if he did not give consent and the question arises whether it was reasonable for him not to do so, to show that it was reasonable,
> 
> and, if the question arises whether he served notice under that subsection within a reasonable time, to show that he did.

> [!summary]
> When the tenant has made written application for consent, the landlord owes a duty, within a reasonable time, to give consent, unless it is reasonable not to do so. In addition, the landlord must serve on the tenant written notice of his decision whether or not to give consent, specifying in addition the conditions he is imposing, or the reasons why he is withholding consent. The burden of proving the reasonableness of any refusal or any conditions imposed is on the landlord.

### Covenants Against Assigning Commercial Leases

> [!statute] s 19(1A) LTA 1927
> Where the landlord and the tenant under a qualifying lease have entered into an agreement specifying for the purposes of this subsection—
> - (a) any circumstances in which the landlord may withhold his licence or consent to an assignment of the demised premises or any part of them, or
> - (b) any conditions subject to which any such licence or consent may be granted,
> 
> then the landlord—
> - (i) shall not be regarded as unreasonably withholding his licence or consent to any such assignment if he withholds it on the ground (and it is the case) that any such circumstances exist, and
> - (ii) if he gives any such licence or consent subject to any such conditions, shall not be regarded as giving it subject to unreasonable conditions;
> 
> and section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1988 (qualified duty to consent to assignment etc.) shall have effect subject to the provisions of this subsection.

These rules enable the landlord and tenant to agree in advance (i.e., in the covenant against assigning) specified circumstances in which the landlord may withhold his consent to an assignment and specified conditions subject to which consent to assignment may be given. If the landlord withholds consent because any of those specified circumstances exist, or imposes any of those specified conditions on his consent, he will not be taken to be acting unreasonably.

#### Factual Vs Discretionary

The provisions permitted under s 19(1A) may be either of a factual nature (eg, whether the  
assignee is a company quoted on the London Stock Exchange), or discretionary (eg, whether  
in the landlord’s opinion the assignee is capable of performing the tenant covenants of the  
lease). Where the provision involves an exercise of discretion, s 19(1A) requires either:

1. that the provision states that discretion is to be exercised reasonably; or
2. that the tenant is given an unrestricted right to have the exercise of the discretion reviewed by an independent third party whose identity is ascertainable from the provision.

### Sub-lettings

The landlord will wish to control sub-letting as well as assignment. Sub-lettings of the whole of the premises are usually subject to the same kinds of restrictions as assignments. However, in the case of sub-lettings of part, the lease provisions are usually considerably stricter. Sub-letting of part is often subject to an absolute prohibition.

Section 19(1)(a) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 and the Landlord and Tenant Act 1988 apply to covenants against assignment, sub-letting or parting with possession. However, s 19(1A) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927 applies only to assignments.

A similar result to s 19(1A) can nevertheless be achieved by careful drafting of the alienation provisions, by imposing conditions precedent to the landlord giving consent. Thus, for example, a requirement that the tenant first offer to surrender the lease without any consideration before assignment was held not to contravene s 19(1)(a) ([[Bocardo SA v S & M Hotels [1980] 1 WLR 17]]).

### Charging or Mortgaging

Most leases will contain restrictions on charging – the landlord doesn't want to deal with a lender taking possession/ exercising power of sale.

## Forfeiture Clause

- Without an express forfeiture clause, the landlord will be unable to remove a tenant until the end of a fixed term, even though the tenant was not complying with the covenants in the lease.
- The clause should give the landlord the right to forfeit if the rent is a specified number of days in arrears and for breach of any other covenant.
- A landlord will not be able to forfeit for covenants other than non-payment unless a s 146 LPA 1925 notice has previously been served on the tenant.
- A court order is required if possession cannot be acquired peaceably and is always necessary for residential property.
- Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002
	- No forfeiture is possible in the case of non-payment of sums $\leq £350$, unless the sum has been outstanding for $>3$ years.
	- For other breaches, landlord cannot forfeit unless T has admitted the breach/ Valuation Tribunal has determined there is a breach of covenant.
- Commercial leases commonly stipulate that L can forfeit if T becomes insolvent.
