# Title Investigation

## Deduction of Title

### Definition

‘Deduction of title’ is the expression used to signify the seller’s obligation to prove to the  
buyer his ownership of the interest which he is purporting to sell. Ownership is proved to the  
buyer by producing documentary evidence of title. The method of doing this varies according  
to whether the land in question is registered or unregistered.

### Timing

Historically, deduction of title took place only after contracts had been exchanged, so that the  
buyer had to take the seller’s title on trust up until that time and to rely on his right to rescind  
the contract if the title later turned out not to reflect what the seller had contracted to sell.

Modern practice (reflected in the Protocol) is for title to be deduced before exchange. This is reflected in both the Standard Conditions of Sale and Standard Commercial Property Conditions (SC 4.2.1 and SCPC 7.2.1).

### Seller's Obligations

The seller’s obligation in relation to the deduction of his title is to supply sufficient documentary evidence to the buyer to prove that she has the right to sell the land.

Standard Condition 4.1.3 (SCPC 7.1.3) requires the seller, at his own expense, to produce to  
the buyer the original of every document within the title, or, if the original is not available, an abstract, epitome or copy with an original marking by a solicitor of examination either against the original, or against an examined abstract or against an examined copy.

### Official Copies

- Both the Protocol and SC 4.1.2 (SCPC 7.1.2) require the seller to supply official copies of her title to the buyer.
- Official copies are copies prepared directly from the register and should always be supplied since they show the up-to-date position of the register.
- The seller should pay for the official copies.
- Under the Protocol, the official copies should be less than six months old.

## Investigation of Title

The key to successful investigation of title is the keeping of systematic and thorough notes of  
issues raised by that investigation and the steps taken to resolve those issues.

### Reasons for Investigation

#### Seller

1. Seller's solicitor's responsibility to draft the contract for sale of the property, containing the terms of the agreement between parties.
2. Investigation of title will enable the seller’s solicitor, at an early stage, to anticipate and, if possible, deal with any problems that might be revealed by the title.

#### Buyer

When the seller has supplied the buyer with evidence of his title, the buyer’s task is twofold:

1. to ensure that the seller is able to transfer what he has contracted to sell;
2. to identify whether there are any defects in, or problems raised by, the title which could adversely affect the interests of the buyer.

#### Lender

If a lender is lending money in the form of a mortgage to help finance the acquisition of a property, it will be concerned to ensure that the property is worth the money that has been  
advanced.

Where the same solicitor is acting for both the buyer and his lender in a transaction, investigation is carried out only once, but will be done on behalf of both the borrower and  
lender client, taking into account the particular interests of each.

In commercial property transactions, the borrower’s solicitor may be required instead to provide the lender with a ‘Certificate of Title’. This is a certificate signed by the borrower’s solicitors certifying that the borrower has a ‘good and marketable’ title to the property. This certificate will be relied on by the lender in lieu of its own investigation of title. Special care should be taken in giving such certificates, as the lender will be able to sue the borrower’s solicitors should there in fact be any problem with the title.

#### Certificate of Title

A report about a property containing a summary of information about the property ascertained by a solicitor through due diligence, as well as statements about the property.

| Question                     | Answer                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who prepares                 | Either seller's solicitor (when there are multiple bidders), buyer's solicitor. Given to the 'Company', who is the client of the solicitor preparing the certificate. |
| When given                   | Immediately prior to completion. Drafts sent earlier in transaction.                                                                                                  |
| What if certificate is wrong | Solicitor's professional indemnity insurance can be relied upon, sue the solicitors for breach of warranty.                                                           |
| Why use                      | Avoids duplication of work, less paperwork, reduced costs.                                                                                                                                                                      |

![[certificate-of-title.png]]

### Timing

Modern practice is for title to be deduced and investigated before exchange of contracts, and  
for any issues that arise from this process to be resolved before that point. If this is the case, as  
the buyer will already have had his opportunity to raise any queries and will have entered into  
the contract with full knowledge of what the title contains, it is usual to find that the contract  
will contain a provision preventing the buyer raising requisitions on some or all aspects of the  
title once exchange has taken place (see SC 4.2.1 and SCPC 7.2.1).

If, exceptionally, title is deduced after exchange, the contract will usually contain a timetable for the raising of, and responding to, requisitions (see SC 4.3 and SCPC 7.3).

### Investigation

Elements of buyer's investigation:

1. Title will be deduced by the seller in the form of official copies of the entries on the register and the title plan, and so, first, a thorough examination of these must be undertaken.
	- Property register
		- Does the description of the land agree with the contract description?
		- Does the title number match the one given in the contract?
		- Is the estate freehold or leasehold? Does this accord with expectations from the contract
		- Which easements are enjoyed by the property? Do these match the needs of the client?
	- Proprietorship register
		- Is the class of title correct?
		- Is the seller the registered proprietor? If not, who has the ability to transfer the land?
		- Are there any other entries? What is their effect?
	- Charges register
		- Are there any incumbrances?
		- How do these affect the buyer?
		- Which of them will be removed or discharged on completion?
		- Have you agreed in the contract to buy subject to the incumbrances which remain?
	- Title plan
		- Is the land being bought included within the title?
		- Are there any colourings/hatchings which may indicate rights of way, the extent of covenants or land which has been removed from the title?
2. Investigations to discover if there are any overriding interests affecting the property.
3. Certain checks before completion to update the information revealed and to ensure that no changes have taken place since the investigation of title was carried out.

## Common Title Problems

See [[Common Title Problems]].

## Raising Requisitions

If the buyer’s solicitor’s investigation of title reveals any problem then the buyer should raise a ‘requisition on title’ of the seller’s solicitor.

> [!defn]
> A requisition is a question asked about the problem which requires a remedy from the seller.

If the seller ultimately cannot show good title then the buyer may consider whether defective title indemnity insurance is available (perhaps at the seller’s cost) in order to protect him should he decide to proceed and accept the defect.

Standard Condition 4.3.1 (SCPC 7.3.1) requires the buyer to raise requisitions within six working days of the later of exchange of contracts or the delivery of the epitome.

It is usual in modern practice for the title to be deduced prior to exchange (see 14.2).

# Common Title Problems

## Trustees of Land

In registered land, a restriction may be entered on the proprietorship register which will indicate to the buyer what must be done to overreach the beneficiaries’ interests. Provided the terms of the restriction are complied with, the buyer will get good title. In all cases, the disposition must be made by all the trustees, being at least two in number, or a trust corporation.

### Appointing Further Trustee

- If there is only one trustee then the buyer must insist that a second trustee is appointed in order to overreach the interests of the beneficiaries (see [[Overreaching]]).
- The appointment will usually be made by the surviving trustee (although the trust deed can confer the power of appointment on someone else).

#### Options

1. The appointment can be made prior to the contract for sale being entered into.
	- The new trustee will thus be a party to the contract and bound by its terms.
	- Particularly useful where the new trustee is also in occupation of the property.
2. The sole trustee can enter into the contract on his own and then appoint a further trustee prior to completion, to receive the purchase price and thus ensure overreaching takes place.
	- A special condition can be included in the contract requiring the seller to appoint the further trustee
	- Note, the seller would be under an obligation to do so anyway in order to comply with the duty to make good title.

### Conveyance by Trustees to Themselves

> [!action]
> In the case of a disposal by trustees or personal representatives to one of themselves, enquiry must be made into the circumstances of the transaction because, on the face of it, such a disposal is in breach of trust and is voidable by the beneficiaries.

#### Exceptions

1. there is proof of a pre-existing contract in favour of the trustee or personal representative;
2. the personal representative was a beneficiary under the will or intestacy of the deceased;
3. the consent of all the legally competent (i.e., adult and sane) beneficiaries was obtained to the transaction;
4. the conveyance was made under an order of the court;
5. the transaction was sanctioned by the trust instrument.

## Personal Representatives

Personal representatives enjoy the same wide powers as trustees of land.

| Number of personal representatives | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1$                                | Has all the powers of two or more personal representatives, and consequently (unlike a sole individual trustee) can convey the land on her own and give a valid receipt for the proceeds of sale. |
| $>1$                               | All personal representatives must join in the assent or conveyance.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

> [!action]
> A buyer must therefore call for the grant to see who has or have been appointed as personal representative(s), and must insist that all the personal representatives named in the grant join in the assent or conveyance, or call for evidence of the death of any personal representative who will not be a party to it.

### Registering as Proprietors

- On production of the grant of probate, personal representatives **may** become registered as proprietors of the land
	- Buyer purchases registered land as normal.
	- Rare, unless holding property for some time (e.g., for a minor)
- Grant of probate is proof of PR's authority to deal with the land.
	- Buyer takes a transfer from all the proving personal representatives and submits an office copy or certified copy of the grant with his application for registration to obtain a good title.
	- An assent made by personal representatives to a beneficiary must be in the form prescribed under the Land Registration Rules 2003 (SI 2003/1417).

## Co-ownership

See [[Co-ownership]]. Practical points:

### Tenants in Common

Restriction entered on proprietorship register:

> “No disposition by a sole proprietor of the registered estate (except a trust corporation) under which capital money arises is to be registered unless authorised by an order of the court.”

If in the death of one or more co-owners there is only one surviving trustee (and you have death certificates to prove), two options:

1. Comply with the restriction, which ensures a second trustee is appointed to join with the survivor in the transfer. Preferred and safest way.
2. Have the restriction removed because the seller can prove they are solely and beneficially entitled to the whole legal and equitable interest in the land.

### Joint Tenants

If the co-owners are joint tenants in equity, **no restriction is placed on the register** and a buyer may generally deal safely with the survivor alone on proof of the death of the deceased co-owner.

It is possible that the equitable joint tenancy could have been severed, but in the absence of a restriction, only if the beneficiary of the deceased has an overriding interest under the LRA 2002 by virtue of being in occupation of the property will a problem arise. Conduct searches and enquiries to check.

## Disposing Lenders

See [[Mortgages]].

s 101 LPA 1925: gives a power to sell the legal estate vested in the borrower, subject to prior incumbrances but discharged from subsequent ones, to every lender whose mortgage is made by deed (unless explicitly excluded).

Only the proprietor of a registered charge has a power of sale. When a property is sold by a lender, the buyer takes the property free from that and any other (secondary) mortgages.

### Power of Sale

#### Arises

 [LPA 1925, s 101(1)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/101): The power of sale arises when the mortgage money becomes due under the mortgage, i.e., on the legal date for redemption (usually early).

#### Exercisable

The power becomes exercisable by the lender only as provided for in the mortgage deed, or when one of the events specified in [s 103 LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/103) has occurred. These events are:

1. a demand has been made for the principal sum outstanding on the mortgage and this demand is unpaid for three months; or
2. any interest due under the mortgage is in arrears for two months; or
3. there is breach of any other covenant in the mortgage.

## Discharged Mortgages

- A mortgage over registered land which has been discharged will be deleted from the charges register of the title and is thus of no further concern to the buyer.
- As far as the seller’s existing mortgage is concerned, the buyer should raise a requisition requiring this to be removed on or before completion.
- Discharge of a mortgage of registered land is effected by filing a completed Form DS1 at Land Registry or by use of the ED or e-DS1 system.

## Attorneys

### Powers of Attorney

> [!defn]
> A power of attorney is a deed under which the donor appoints someone (the attorney or donee) to carry out certain actions on their behalf.

### Types of Power

| Power          | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General power  | s 10 of the Powers of Attorney Act 1971: entitles the attorney to deal with all of the donor’s assets |
| Special power  | Permits the attorney to deal only with certain specified assets or categories of assets               |
| Trustee power  | Used where property is held on trust                                                                                                      |
| Enduring power | Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985: endures through the donor's mental incapacity                   |
| Lasting power  | Replaced enduring power (01/10/2007)                                                                  |

### Revocation

Power of attorney may be revoked expressly by the donor, or will be revoked automatically on the donor’s death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy. Once registered, enduring powers are irrevocable except by order of the court.

A person who buys from an attorney (and subsequent buyers) will get good title if the power:

1. authorises the transaction which is to take place between the attorney and the buyer; and
2. is valid and subsisting at the date of completion of the transaction.

### Buyer Protection

The buyer is given protection through the Powers of Attorney Act 1971:

#### Copy of Power

Buyer entitled to a certified copy of the power of attorney affecting the title–Land Registry will require a copy before registering a disposition. Buyer should check terms of the power to ensure the transaction was authorised.

#### General, Special and Trustee Powers

A person who deals with an attorney holding these types of powers of attorney will take good title, provided he acquires in good faith without knowledge of the revocation of the power:

> [!statute] s 5(2) Powers of Attorney Act 1971
> Where a power of attorney has been revoked and a person, without knowledge of the revocation, deals with the donee of the power, the transaction between them shall, in favour of that person, be as valid as if the power had then been in existence.

Death revokes such a power.

> [!statute] s 5(4) Powers of Attorney Act 1971
> Where the interest of a purchaser depends on whether a transaction between the donee of a power of attorney and another person was valid by virtue of subsection (2) of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed in favour of the purchaser that that person did not at the material time know of the revocation of the power if—
> - (a) the transaction between that person and the donee was completed within twelve months of the date on which the power came into operation; or
> - (b) that person makes a statutory declaration, before or within three months after the completion of the purchase, that he did not at the material time know of the revocation of the power.

#### Enduring Powers

> [!defn]
> An enduring power of attorney is one made under the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985. This Act has been repealed and enduring powers are now governed by provisions contained in Sch 4 to the Mental Capacity Act 2005. 

Until the incapacity of the donor, the power takes effect as an ordinary power and the Mental Capacity Act contains provisions to protect buyers which are similar to those outlined above. On the incapacity of the donor, the attorney’s authority to act becomes limited to such acts as are necessary for the protection of the donor and his estate until such time as the power is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian.

> [!action]
> Where a person is buying from an attorney who holds an enduring power, he should make a search at the Office of the Public Guardian to ensure that no application for registration of the power is pending. If an application is pending, this would suggest mental incapacity on the part of the donor.

#### Lasting Powers

> [!defn]
> The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (in force 1 October 2007) replaced enduring powers with a new form of power called a lasting power. Lasting powers give an attorney power to deal with the donor’s personal welfare and/or his property and affairs, including authority to deal with such matters when the donor no longer has capacity.

The lasting power is required to be in a prescribed form but, unlike enduring powers, comes into effect only when registered with the Office of the Public Guardian.

> [!action]
> Where the buyer is buying from an attorney who holds a lasting power, he should obtain an office copy of the power from the Office of the Public Guardian as evidence that the lasting power is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian and to check that the attorney is acting within the scope of his authority.
> 
> The buyer from the attorney will be protected unless he knew the power was invalid (by s 14(3) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005) or was aware of circumstances which would have terminated the attorney’s authority to act (by s 5(2) of the Powers of Attorney Act 1971).

#### Trustees

> [!guid]
> If one of two co-owners wishes to appoint an attorney to execute a deed selling the land, the co-trustee cannot be appointed, as such co-trustee will not be able to give a valid receipt. In such a case, a stranger will need to be appointed, and this rule cannot be evaded by using an enduring power.

## Transactions at an Undervalue

> [!warning]
> Where in the chain of title there is a transaction for no consideration or at an undervalue, care needs to be exercised, since the transaction could be set aside under the Insolvency Act 1986.

| Party      | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Statute       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Individual | A transaction at an undervalue by an individual within the five years immediately preceding the current transaction may be set aside by the trustee in bankruptcy if the donor is made bankrupt          | s 339 IA 1986 |
| Company    | If a transaction at an undervalue was made by a company within the two years preceding the date of the current transaction, it may be set aside by the liquidator on the company’s subsequent insolvency | s 238 IA 1986              |

### Buyer Defences

> [!note]
> The basic principle is that a subsequent buyer is protected, provided that he has acquired in good faith and for value from a person other than the insolvent company or bankrupt individual (Insolvency Act 1986, s 241(2)(a) and s 342(2)(a)).

See [[Business Law and Practice/Insolvency/Voidable Transactions#Sanctions]] above for details on presumption of good faith. Remember, [[connected person]] includes directors, shadow directors and associates. [[Associate]] defined widely in s 435 IA 1986 to include a person’s spouse or ex-spouse, members of his family and his spouse’s family, his partner and his partner’s family, and his employees.

> [!action]
> - Registration of bankruptcy proceedings will amount to notice, so a buyer will need to make a bankruptcy search against the individual making the transaction at an undervalue not for the period of that person’s ownership, but for a period of five years from the date of the transaction at an undervalue.
> - In the case of companies, the relevant time is 2 years. 

### Registered Land

In the case of dispositions registered on or after 1 April 2000, the register includes details of the price paid by the proprietor.

> [!action]
> If this appears to be nil or something of low monetary value, the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 should be borne in mind. 

Where first registration is based on a transaction at an undervalue, a note will be added in the proprietorship register to the effect that the title is subject to the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986.

Some lenders are reluctant to lend on property where there has been a transaction at an undervalue within the past two years (companies) or five years (individuals), unless an **insurance** policy is obtained covering the possibility of the donor’s insolvency within these periods.

## Restrictive Covenants

Instructions may reveal that the buyer’s intended use of the property after completion will cause a breach of existing covenants.

1. Check whether the covenant is registered (usually is)
2. Look at the wording of the covenant to see whether it has been annexed to the land and is prima facie binding.
3. Consider whether it is possible to obtain an insurance policy to cover liability for future breaches of covenant. Insurance company will need details of the covenant, local area, any steps taken etc.

### Ending Freehold Covenants

The methods by which a freehold covenant can be brought to an end are discharge, modification and release.

#### Problem with Old Covenants

Restrictive covenants, once validly granted, last forever. Over time, these can become obsolete and can unduly restrict the use of the servient land.

> [!example]
> A covenant not to build on land might have benefitted the dominant tenement whilst that land was used for residential purposes, but no longer does if the dominant land is now a factory.

There are various ways in which a covenant can be discharged or modified. Discharge if a covenant means that it is no longer valid.

Modification of a covenant means that the scope of the covenant is altered, but it is not completely invalidated.

#### Methods of discharging/modifying Covenants

A covenant will be automatically be discharged if the same person becomes the owner of both the dominant and servient land: [[Re Tiltwood, Sussex [1978] Ch 269]].

This is known as merger. A dominant owner may expressly agree to discharge the covenant and will enter into a formal release of covenant, usually in return for a payment.

The release must be made by deed. Alternatively, the dominant owner may impliedly agree to discharge the covenant by doing nothing when the covenant is being breached openly.

#### Statutory Discharge or Modification of Covenants

The dominant owner could hold the servient owner to ransom by asking for a large sum of money to discharge an obsolete covenant.

To avoid this, the servient owner can apply to the [[Tribunals#Upper Tribunal]] (Lands Chamber) for the discharge or modification of any covenant.

[Law of Property Act 1925, s 84(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/84) gives the Lands Chamber the power ‘wholly or partially to discharge or modify any… restriction’.

> [!warning]
> This provision only applies to restrictive covenants.

> [!statute] [LPA 1925, s 84(1)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/84)
> 
> A servient owner may apply to the tribunal for a declaration to discharge or modify a covenant on the basis that the covenant has become obsolete due to changes in the character of the property or neighbourhood.

> [!example]
> A covenant to use property only as a residence may be obsolete if the surrounding area is now business, retail of mixed use.

[s 84(1)(aa)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/84) enables an application to be made on the basis that the covenant impedes reasonable use of the servient land. The applicant must show either that the covenant confers no practical value, or that it is contrary to public interest.

The tribunal must be satisfied that financial compensation would be adequate for the dominant owner.

> [!example]
> A covenant restricting the density of houses on a plot may confer no practical value on the dominant land if that land is itself densely developed.

S 84(1)(b) applies where the dominant owners have agreed, expressly or impliedly, to discharge.

> [!example]
> An application here may be appropriate where the parties have expressly agreed a release in principle, or where the dominant owner has tolerated a long-term breach. In this instance, the tribunal will decide the level of compensation to be paid, thereby preventing the dominant owner holding the servient owner to ransom.

S 84(1)(c) enables an application to be made where discharge if a covenant will not 'injure' the dominant owners.

This provision means that the tribunal can override spurious or frivolous objections.

However, the tribunal has a balancing act to do: on the one hand it will be wary of discharging covenants on this basis simply because discharge will not injure the current dominant owner. On the other hand it will have regard to social and economic concerns: the wider public interest rather than the interest of one particular dominant owner.

### Insurance

If a policy is issued, it is normally a single premium policy (a single sum is paid on the issue of the policy). The benefit of the policy may be passed on to successors in title. The buyer’s lender should be consulted about the proposed breach of covenant and his approval obtained to the terms of the insurance policy.

> [!danger]
> In arranging or advising on such a policy, the solicitor is carrying out a ‘regulated activity’ for the purposes of the FSMA 2000. Ensure you fall within the professional firms exemption to avoid committing a criminal offence.

### Other Methods

To be used only if insurance is not possible.

- Approach the person with the benefit of the covenant.
	- Often they may accept payment for release from the covenant.
	- But there might be multiple parties with the benefit of the covenant
	- By putting the benefitting party on notice, makes it almost impossible to get insurance.
- Apply to Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber)
	- Has power in certain circumstances under the LPA 1925, s 84 to grant a modification or discharge of a restrictive covenant.

### Competition Legislation

#### Competition Act 1998

- This prohibits any agreement which may affect trade within the UK and which prevents, restricts or distorts competition within the UK.
- Since April 2011 this prohibition has applied to land agreements, which include transfers of freehold and leasehold interests together with leases themselves.
- It only applies to agreements between businesses
- It is retrospective, thus the date of the covenant is irrelevant.
- It is not possible to exclude the Act.

#### Prohibited Restrictions

Unless the covenant has an ‘appreciable effect’ on the market affected by the  
agreement, it will not fall within the competition legislation. Whether such provisions have an appreciable effect depends on a number of factors, including the scope of the relevant market and the degree of market power of the parties.

#### Consequences

- Fines of up to 10% of a firm’s worldwide turnover
- Agreement containing a prohibited restriction void and unenforceable (though a court may consider it possible to sever the prohibited restriction and let other terms of the agreement remain valid).

#### Groceries

Certain land agreements in connection with grocery retailing activities are subject to  
additional control under the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the ‘Controlled Land Order’).

## Positive Covenants

The burden (the obligation to observe a covenant) does not generally bind successors in title of freehold land where a covenant is positive in nature. There is one anomalous exception to this principle, a fencing "easement".

A positive covenant may be enforced at law even though the covenantor owns no estate of any kind in land. The common law only requires that the covenantee must hold an estate in land to which the benefit of an enforceable covenant can accrue.

Although the burden of a positive covenant does not run with the land, there are various workarounds which can be adopted to ensure a similar outcome.

### Passing Burden

- Chain of indemnity
	- Although a positive obligation is not directly enforceable against a successor in title, it may be indirectly enforceable through indemnities given by a buyer to the previous owner.
	- But chain only as strong as its weakest link
	- Only damages can be obtained, not injunction etc.
- Compulsory renewed covenants supported with a restriction
	- Most common way of making the burden of positive covenants run.
	- The transferee gives a binding obligation to compel its own successor to:
		- Enter into a direct covenant with the dominant owner at the date of the new covenant, in the same terms as the initial positive covenant.
		- Impose a further obligation to provide a direct covenant in similar terms on its successor.
	- Risk: the covenantor could transfer the land without complying with its obligation to obtain a further covenant from the transferee. Breach of contract remedies will be inadequate.
	- Common practice to ensure compliance by adding an appropriately worded restriction on the servient landowner's title: “no disposition of the land in that title should be registered without a certificate signed by a conveyancer confirming that the requirement to provide a new deed of covenant has been met”.
	- But inappropriate where lots of people benefit from the covenants, in particular where there are numerous plots of dominant land.
- Right of entry annexed to an estate rentcharge
	- To secure the performance of positive covenants, the owner of the land may reserve a rentcharge to which it annexes a right of entry.
	- A rentcharge is “any annual or other periodic sum of money charged on or issuing out of land”, otherwise than under a lease or mortgage".
	- An estate rentcharge can be used to enforce a positive obligation, because the chargor takes a legal right of entry (i.e., possession) in the event of default.
	- The right of entry may be exercised not only for failure to pay the rentcharge, but also for breach of the covenant, subject to the court providing relief against forfeiture.
	- Draconian for buyers
	- The rentcharge may be for a nominal amount and serves as a peg on which to hang the enforcement of the covenant.
- Benefit and burden rule
	- See section below.
	- So be careful about relying on [[Halsall v Brizell [1957] Ch 169]] in practice: there is a risk the courts will not recognise a condition precedent to an obligation to repair/ maintain something.
- Freehold right of re-entry
	- The seller transfers the property to the buyer, but retains an express (equitable) right of re-entry, under which the property will revert to the seller if the positive covenant is not performed.
	- As the right of re-entry is an equitable interest, it should be protected by a notice registered against the buyer's title to the property.
	- Draconian and rarely used in practice.
	- May make borrowing problematic
- Use of leasehold title
	- The burden of a positive covenant may run with a leasehold estate.
	- s 153 LPA 1925: grants a right to enfranchise (expressed as a right to enlarge the term of the lease into a fee simple).
	- Where a lease may be enlarged into a freehold, section 153 provides that it will be subject to the same covenants, obligations and provisions which burdened the lease.
	- Untested, complicated.

#### Mutual Benefit and Burden

[[Halsall v Brizell [1957] Ch 169]] gives a limited exception to the general rule, enabling the burden of a covenant to pass to a successor covenantor at common law. It is known as the **‘mutual benefit and burden’ rule**, and applies where the covenantee grants to the covenantor a benefit in the nature of an easement, and imposes a connected burden.

For example, in the transfer deed selling part of a piece of land, a covenantee grants the covenantor a right to park on the covenantee’s land. In the same deed, the covenantor covenants to contribute to the cost of maintaining the parking area.

In a case like this, a successor covenantor cannot take the benefit of parking but avoid payment by relying on the basic common law rule of the burden not passing.

##### Refinements

The rules has been refined in subsequent cases:

| Case                                               | Ratio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Rhone v Stephens [1994] 2 AC 310]]               | There must be a clear link between the burden and the benefit. There is no general principle that someone who takes a benefit under a deed must submit to any burden which it imposes.                                                                     |
| [[Thamesmead Town Ltd v Allotey (1998) 3 EGLR 97]] | There must be a genuine choice as to whether or not to take the benefit. This choice can be theoretical. The condition of discharging the covenanted burden must be relevant to the exercise of the right (more than incidental). |
| [[Davies v Jones [2009] EWCA Civ 1164]]            | The benefit and burden must have been conferred in the same transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

##### Grant of Long Lease

One way of side-stepping the rule that the burden of a freehold covenant will not pass to a successor covenantor is to dispose of the land by way of long lease.

All covenants in leases except personal ones are enforceable by and against successors in title via the doctrine of privity of estate.

##### Commonhold Development

Commonhold is a way of holding land in units such as blocks of flats. Each unit owner has obligations, such as contributing towards the maintenance of each unit. The rights and obligations attach by statute ([Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/15/contents)) to each unit, so all obligations are enforceable against all unit holders at all times.

Unfortunately, commonhold has not proved a popular way of holding land.

##### Restriction: S 40 LRA 2002

> [!note]
> This is the most commonly used way of making the burden of positive covenants run on registered land.

A covenantee can put a restriction on the **proprietorship register of the burdened land**. This states that no transfer of the burdened land can be registered without the consent of the covenantee.

As a condition of giving consent to the transaction, the covenantee takes a direct covenant from the purchaser of the burdened land.

In the new covenant, the new owner promises to observe the covenants in the original transfer. This creates a new privity of contract between the covenantee and purchaser, enabling direct enforcement of the covenants.

##### Other Methods

- Reserving a rentcharge annexed to a right of entry
- Reserving a freehold right of entry
- Less commonly used.

### Passing Benefit

The original covenantee can enforce a covenant as a matter of contract law. If the dominant land is sold, the successor covenantee must show that the benefit has passed to it at common law.

This enables the successor covenantee to enforce the covenant either against the original covenantor, or (in limited circumstances) against the successor covenantor.

There are two ways the benefit can pass at common law:

#### Express Assignment

Under normal contractual principles, the benefit of a covenant can be expressly assigned to a successor.

[LPA 1925, s 136](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/136) requires the assignment must be in writing and express notice of the assignment must be given to the covenantor. This is to ensure that the covenantor realises that a new person is in a position to enforce the covenant.

#### Implied Assignment

Where there is no express assignment, the benefit of a covenant may pass to a successor covenantee if certain conditions are met. This involves the benefit automatically passing every time the land is transferred, as long as the conditions are met.

> [!test] Implied assignment
> 
> The conditions of implied assignment are set out in [[P&A Swift Investments Ltd v Combined English Stores Group plc [1989] AC 632]]:
> 1. The covenant must touch and concern the land
> 2. There must have been an intention that the benefit should run with the dominant land
> 3. The original covenantee must have a legal estate in the dominant land
> 4. The successor covenantee must hold a legal estate in the dominant land

#### The Covenant Must Touch and Concern the Land

The covenant must benefit the dominant land itself, it must affect the nature, quality, use or value of the land. It must not be expressed to be personal and should only benefit the dominant owner for the time being, so that, if separated from the land, it ceases to be of any advantage to them.

> [!example]
> A covenant to maintain a house on the burdened land does touch and concern the dominant land as it preserves the quality of the environment and therefore the value of the dominant land.

#### Intention That Benefit Runs with Dominant Land

Intention of the parties can be shown expressly or impliedly through statute.

If there is no express intention, [LPA 1925, s 78](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/78) implies an intention for the benefit to pass unless it is expressly excluded.

> [!example]
> A covenant drafted ‘for the benefit of land known as 5 High Street’ or ‘with the covenantee and successors in title to land known as 5 High Street’ shows express intention

The original covenantee must have a legal estate in the dominant land, and the successor covenantee must hold a legal estate in the dominant land.

The original covenantee must have owned a legal estate when the covenant was made, and that the successor must own a legal estate at the time of enforcement.

The legal estate does not need to be of the same nature: [[Smith and Snipes Hall Farm Ltd v River Douglas Catchment Board [1949] 2 KB 500]].

In that case, the original covenantee held a freehold and the successor held a leasehold. The successor was held to be entitled to the benefit of the covenant and could therefore enforce it.

### Drafting Transfer

Best practice to refer to all the positive covenants together in one of the following ways:

1. "the Transferee covenants with the Transferor, for the benefit of the Transferor's Retained Land and each and every part of it, with the intention of binding the Property and each and every part of it, to comply with the covenants set out in the sub-clauses."
2. "the Transferee covenants with the Transferor, for the benefit of the Transferor's Retained Land and each and every part of it, with the intention of binding the Property and each and every part of it, to comply with the covenants set out in Schedule [NUMBER]."

## Execution of Deeds

Check deeds are properly executed.

In the case of registered land, title is updated by Land Registry whenever there is a dealing in respect of that title. As part of this process, Land Registry will scrutinise the execution of the document giving effect to that dealing before recording its effect on the register.

### By an Individual

#### New Rule

The formalities for execution of a deed changed on 31 July 1990. For deeds executed on or after 31 July 1990, the following rules apply ([s 1 LP(MP)A 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/1)):

1. A deed must be clear on the face of the document that it is **intended** to be a deed
	- Satisfied by labelling the document as a deed
2. The deed must be validly **executed**
	- Where the grantor (seller) is an individual, the deed must be signed by the seller in the presence of a witness.
	- The witness needs to sign the deed to confirm that they have witnessed the signing of the deed by the individual entering into that deed. Described in statute as 'attesting' the signature.
	- There is no legal requirement for a buyer to sign the deed, but in practice both parties tend to execute the deed.
3. The deed must be **delivered**.
	- This requires an acknowledgement that a person entering into a deed intends to be formally bound by its provisions. In practice, this takes place by dating the document, which the parties' solicitors will do.

It is possible for an individual to direct another person to sign a deed on his behalf, provided that the  
signature is made in his presence and there are two attesting witnesses.

#### Old Rule

The document had to be signed and sealed by its maker, and delivered as his deed. The seal was usually only a red, self-adhesive circular piece of paper. The delivery of the deed was a matter of intention.

### By a Company

In the case of deeds executed by a company on or after 31 July 1990, a document can be executed in one of three ways:

1. By the affixing of the company seal.
	- It must be clear on the face of the document that is intended to be a deed.
	- If this method of execution is used, the document is deemed, in favour of a purchaser, to have been duly executed, provided that the seal purports to have been affixed in the presence of and attested by two members of the board of directors or a director and the secretary.
2. By being signed by a director and the secretary, or by two directors of the company, provided that the document is expressed to be executed by the company.
3. A deed can be executed by being signed by a single director in the presence of a witness who then attests that signature (on/after 06/04/2008 only).

> [!warning]
> Must say 'executed as a deed', 'signed as a deed' is not acceptable.

Must also be delivered as a deed.

# Searches and Enquiries

## Reasons

- Caveat emptor
- When drafting the contract, the seller has only very limited duties to disclose matters affecting title to the property.
- Buyer's solicitor must take steps to ensure the suitability of the property.
- Failure can give rise to liability in negligence, if the buyer subsequently suffers loss ([[Cooper v Stephenson (1852) 21 LJQB 292]])
- Buyer must be fully advised of the information discovered and its implications for the proposed purchase.

## Who

Buyer must make all necessary pre-conduct searches. Lender's Handbook requires that all searches be $\leq 6$ months old at the date of completion.

## How

Many searches can be undertaken electronically. Searches with the local authority can take several weeks.

## What

Standard in every transaction:

- Search of local land charges register
- Enquiry of local authority
- Pre-contract enquiries of seller
- Water and drainage enquiries
- Environmental search
- Personal inspection.

Additional searches:

- Chancel repair search
- Index map search
- Land Charges Department search against seller's name/ previous owners' names for unregistered land.
- Company search
- Flood search
- Location specific searches
- Survey reports.

## Local Land Charges Search

> [!defn] Local land charges
> Financial charges or restrictions on land imposed by public authorities under statute. 

Essential to search this in every transaction. It will be necessary to search either a register maintained by the local authority or the land registry, depending on the area. A fee is payable for an official search.

Search result is given by way of certificate, digitally signed by an officer of the council/ Land Registry (LR taking over slowly under Infrastructure Act 2015). A fee is payable for copies of documents. The search will reveal any entries kept under statutory obligations. Might overlap with information from Form CON29, but should still do both to complete due diligence.

### Examples

> [!example] Matters revealed by local land charges
> - Financial charges
> - Tree preservation orders
> - Smoke control orders
> - Compulsory purchase orders
> - Planning permission granted
> - Restrictions on permitted development
> - Orders revoking/ modifying planning permissions. 
> - Conservation area designation orders
> - Listed building status. 

For each, consider:

1. Significance
2. How it affects buyer's intended use of building.

### Liability

Where a person suffers as a result of an error in an official certificate of search, compensation may be payable under s 10 of the Local Land Charges Act 1975.

## Enquiries of Local Authority

- Submit Form CON29 to the appropriate authority (district/ London council).
	- CON29 relevant to every transaction.
- CON29O more specialised in nature.
	- Consider whether needed.

CON29 will reveal:

- Any planning permissions granted/ refused / pending
- Whether roads are public.
- Any public paths or right of way
- Any new roads or railways proposed near building.
- Any proposals for permanently stopping up roads or footpaths.
- Any proceedings for breach of building regulations
- Any proposed compulsory purchase orders.
- Any notice served of contaminated land.
- Radon gas
- Whether a property is of community value.

CON29O:

- Special designation area
- Environmental/ pollution notices
- Registration of common land/ village green.

### Liability

Subject to the validity of the exclusion clause printed on the front sheet of the search application form, a local authority could be sued in negligence for an erroneous reply to the printed enquiries.

### Forms LLC1 Vs CON29/O

| Form    | Extent                                                                                   | Liability                                        | Information revealed                                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LLC1    | Will only reveal matters falling within the statutory definition of a local land charge. | Negligence need not be established for liability | Restricted to information on the register at the moment the search is made. |
| CON29/O | Wide range of matters                                                                    | Negligence must be established for liability     | May reveal information which affected property in the past, or will do so in future.                                                                             |

### Personal Searches

The local authority can take a few weeks to get back. Possible to undertake a personal search with an agent if needed urgently - the agent will personally search the offices of the appropriate local authority. There are third party providers holding local information. Some mortgage lenders will not accept personal searches.

#### Regulation

There is a 'Search Code' monitored and enforced by the Property Codes Compliance Board.

## Seller Enquiries

Pre-contract enquiries of the seller is one of the usual searches made in every transaction. Object is to obtain information which the seller is not bound by law to disclose. The seller could refuse to answer - but this would not make commercial sense.

### Residential Property

Seller's solicitor should ask client to complete various forms.

| Form | Details                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------- |
| TA06 | Property Information Form         |
| TA07 | Leasehold Information Form        |
| LPE1 | Leasehold Property Enquiries Form |
| LPE2 | Leasehold Consumer Summary Form   |
| FME1 | Freehold Management Enquiries Form.                                   |

An erroneous or misleading reply to these questions could give rise to liability in misrepresentation.

### Commercial Property

Different versions of forms can be used. In order to try to bring some uniformity to preliminary enquiries, the Commercial Property Standard Enquiries (CPSE) have been drafted. These go from CPSE 1-7.

### Additional Enquiries

Make additional enquiries if needed! This could be on the basis of the information reealed in the standard form.

### Liability

An incorrect reply to pre-contract enquiries may lead to liability in misrepresentation. Any exclusion clauses subject to s 11 [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]]. Where the erroneous reply stems from the seller’s solicitor’s negligence, they will be liable to their own client ([[CEMP Proper ties (UK) Ltd v Dentsply Research and Development Corporation (No 1) (1989) 2 EGLR 192]]), but in this respect they do not owe a duty directly to the buyer (see [[Gran Gelato v Richcliffe (Group) [1992] 1 All ER 865]]).

> [!tip]
> If the seller says "not so far as the seller is aware", they are representing ([[William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC [1994] 1 WLR 1016]]):
> 1. Seller has no actual knowledge of a matter
> 2. All reasonable enquiries that a prudent conveyancer would have made have been made. 

## Specific Enquiries

### Water and Drainage Enquiries

Make these enquiries.

If the property does not drain into a public sewer, the buyer will be liable for the costs of maintaining the drains and sewers, and may be liable for the costs of bringing them up to adoption standard if the water authority decides to adopt them.

If there is a public sewer on the property, the water company’s consent will be needed to any development over or within the vicinity of the sewer.

### Environmental Searches

Consider:

- Contamination of land
- Nearby landfill sites/ factories
- Greenfield/ brownfield site
- Assess risk; if the risk is high, have an environmental survey taken.

### Chancel Repair Searches

Certain properties in certain parishes could be under an obligation to pay the cost of repairing the chancel of the parish church. This used to be an overriding obligation, but since 13/10/13 is no longer overriding. Easiest option: get insurance.

### Bankruptcy Search

Made against buyer/ borrower to ensure they are not bankrupt. The lender will not lend if the buyer is bankrupt.

The search can be done electronically, or sending Form K16 to the Land Charges Department. Can take a while; prudent to make this search prior to exchange.

### Company Search

Buyer should search against a corporate seller. Lender should search against a corporate buyer. There is no standard company search. Check:

- Solvency
- Undisclosed charges
	- Fixed or floating charges
	- No action is needed in relation to charges registered at Companies House, but not protected by registration at Land Registry.
		- Exception: transactions involving sale of chattels.
		- A charge purporting to attach to chattels must be dealt with
			- Fixed charge: discharge before completion
			- Floating charge: obtain a certificate of non-crystallisation, signed by the lender.

### Flood Search

A Government-backed scheme known as ‘Flood Re’ ensures that flood cover is provided for most residential properties. Flood Re provides flood insurance for homes over a 25-year period from April 2016. Certain property (such as commercial property, buy to let properties, residential property built since 1 January 2009 and blocks of flats) is not covered by the scheme. Consider insurance.

- Free screening available based on postcode with environmental agency.
- Land Registry provides a flood risk indicator.
- But consider other means, including commercial search providers, enquiries of the seller, specialist surveys.

### Index Map Search

Index of the land in every registered title and pending application for first registration.

> [!action]
> Do this search if the land being sold appears to be unregistered. 

### Inspection of Property

Always inspect the property.

### Location Specific Searches

A solicitor who fails to carry out a relevant search in circumstances where they should have done so may be liable in negligence to their client ([[G & K Ladenbau (UK) Ltd v Crawley and De Reya [1978] 1 All ER 682]]).

Examples:

- Mining searches
- Common land town and village greens
- Land adjoining rivers, streams or canals
- Railways
- Highways search

Failure to pursue an unsatisfactory reply which results in loss being suffered by the client, may result in the buyer’s solicitor being liable to their own client in negligence ([[Computastaff Ltd v Ingledew Brown Bennison & Garrett (1983) 7 ILR 156]]).

Also consider:

- Occupiers
- Building works/ changes of usage

### Imputed Knowledge

Knowledge acquired by the solicitor while acting on their client’s behalf is imputed to the client (regardless of whether the client had actual knowledge of the matter in question). An indemnity against the seller's liability in such cases should be sought from the seller's solicitors.

### Searches Made by Third Parties

Can be relied upon, but conduct own searches if you feel the searches another party have done are insufficient.

The solicitor should also remember that if they are acting for the buyer’s lender as  
well as the buyer, they should keep the lender client informed about any matters affecting the  
value or saleability of the property, or which otherwise might affect the lender’s decision to lend on the security of the property.

### Estate Roads

The new estate roads are likely to be 'adopted' (publicly maintained) by the local authority, though they might not be. Between developer and buyer there should be a clause stipulating that the developer will be responsible for making up the roads to the local authority's standard and keeping them in that condition until adopted, at no extra cost to buyer.

Check to see that a Highways Act  
1980 Section 38 Agreement has been entered into by the developer with the highway  
authority. This is an agreement between the developer and the highway authority that the  
developer will be responsible for the roads. This agreement must therefore be supported by a financial bond, issued by a bank or an insurance company, in a sufficient amount to cover against the developer defaulting on the Road Agreement.

In cases where there is no agreement and bond, a mortgage lender will usually protect itself  
against the property owner having to pay road charges by making a retention from the  
advance of the estimated cost of those charges. This retention will be released only when the  
roads are adopted.

### Drains and Sewers

Check whether the ownership and maintenance of the drains has been or is to be transferred to the water authority. If the water authority were to adopt the drains without their having been constructed to the proper standards, there is a risk that the properties being served might incur charges.

# Draft Contract

- Although title is transferred in the transfer deed on completion, the terms of the transfer deed are fixed by the terms of the contract.
- The seller drafts the contract, but terms are open to negotiation.

## Seller's Capacity

Check the seller is entitled to sell the whole of the estate in land. Some circumstances require further investigation.

| Trustees (including co-owners) | A second trustee may be needed to overreach any beneficial entitlement.                                                                                           |

## Elements of Contract

- States that the seller agrees to seller and buyer to buy.
- Sets out the terms of sale
- Usually comprised of:
	- Particulars of sale
	- Standard conditions of sale
	- Special conditions.

> [!statute] s 2 LP(MP)A
> (1) A contract for the sale or other disposition of an interest in land can only be made **in writing** and only by **incorporating all the terms** which the parties have expressly agreed in one document or, where contracts are exchanged, in each.
> 
> (2) The terms may be incorporated in a document either by being **set out in it or by reference to some other document**.

## Particulars of Sale

- Describe the estate in land which is being sold.
- Might reference easements/ covenants benefitting the land
- Aim: clear and precise description of the property.
- Usually postal address and registered title number suffices.

### Plans

- Must be used if selling a part of land
- Desirable in other cases if property boundaries not self-evident.
- Generally not necessary for the sale of the whole of a registered freehold.
- Land Registry Practice Guide 40: detailed requirements of plans submitted.
- Seller usually pays for preparation of the plan.
- Showing features
	- Sold land in red
	- Retained land in blue
	- Agreed ownership of boundaries indicated by “T” marks; T on the side of the boundary responsible for maintenance.
	- Use a key.

There should be no discrepancy between the verbal description of land and the plan. If there is:

| Terminology                    | Construction                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Identification purposes only" | Verbal description prevails. Note the Land Registry will not accept such a plan. |
| "More particularly delineated" | Plan prevails. Only use if the plan is to scale.                                                                                  |

### Easements and Rights

Investigation of title will reveal whether the property has the benefit of easements/ rights. May be included in the particulars of sale, but not essential since the benefit will pass under s 62 LPA 1925.

Errors in the particulars of sale may give the buyer a remedy in misdescription/ misrepresentation.

## Standard Conditions

- SCPCs designed for use in more complex and high-value commercial property transactions.
	- Part 1 conditions are of general application and apply unless varied by special condition.
	- Part 2 conditions only relevant for certain transactions, only apply if specifically incorporated by special condition.
- SCs are less extensive, designed for residential or lower value transactions.

Possible to purchase a pre-printed contract with gaps to insert transaction details. Most law firms will have their own precedents.

## Special Conditions

Purposes:

1. May be necessary to deal with particular circumstances of transaction.
2. May be desirable to vary the standard condition position.

> [!important]
> If a special condition contradicts the standard condition position, the special condition prevails (Standard Condition 1.1.4/ SCPC 1.1.4(a)). But often the standard condition is expressly excluded for the avoidance of doubt. 

The seller's solicitor should consider the following areas when deciding which special conditions are needed for drafting the contract.

### Seller's Duty to Disclose Incumbrances

Standard Condition 3.1.1 and SCPC 4.1.1 state that the seller will sell the property free from incumbrances other than those listed in SC 3.1.2 and SCPC 4.1.2. So the seller’s solicitor must list in a special condition all incumbrances not covered by SC 3.1.2 or SCPC 4.1.2.

Some practitioners just list all incumbrances as a special condition, regardless of whether covered under one of the standard conditions.

> [!note] Defects in title
> Standard Condition 3.1.1 and SCPC 4.1.1 imply that there is no other flaw/ defect in the title. Such flaws must therefore be specifically disclosed by a special conditions, or the buyer will have remedies for non-disclosure. Also state that the buyer will not be entitled to raise any objection to the defect. 

- If a Green Deal plan exists, the contract must acknowledge that the buyer will pay this.
- Physical defects do not need to be disclosed (SC 3.2.1 and SCPC 4.2.1).
- If there is a defect in title, consider seeking insurance.
	- Then negotiate who should pay for this.
	- If the seller is paying, insert a special condition to this effect.

### Deducing Title

Traditionally, title investigation and deduction took place after contracts were exchanged. It was therefore important for rules to exist governing what the seller had to produce to establish proper title. Standard Condition 4.1 (SCPC 7.1) sets out what documentary evidence of title the seller is to provide.

Modern practice is for title to be deduced and investigated before contracts are exchanged. This happens in the vast majority of cases. As a result, the rules governing deduction of title are often not considered because exchange will not take place until the investigating party is satisfied on title. If title has been deduced before exchange, no requisitions can be raised on that title (SC 4.2.1 and SCPC 7.2.1).

### Title Guarantee

The buyer can be given the benefit of certain implied covenants under LP(MP)A 1994.

- “The seller sells with full title guarantee” gives the buyer the benefit of all covenants implied under LP(MP)A 1994
	1. A covenant that the seller has the right to dispose of the land.
	2. A covenant that the seller will do all he reasonably can to transfer the title.
	3. If the land disposed of is leasehold land, a covenant that the lease is subsisting at the time it is disposed of, and that there is no breach of covenant making the lease liable to forfeiture.
	4. A covenant that the land is disposed of free from incumbrances, other than those the seller does not know about and could not reasonably know about. Subject to s 6 LP(MP)A 1994 - the seller is not in breach of any implied covenants in respect of:
		1. Matters to which the disposition is expressly made subject
		2. Matters which buyer knows about at the time of disposition
		3. Matters entered on the register of title at the time of disposition.
- "The seller sells with limited title guarantee"
	- (1) to (3) as above.
	- (4) swapper for the seller promising that he has not incumbered the land
- Possible to sell with no title guarantee.
- Both sets of standard conditions imply full title guarantee (SC 4.6.2, SCPC 7.6.2).

#### Choosing Title Guarantee

If the seller has good title and knowledge of incumbrances, no reason not to give a full title guarantee. If the seller has limited knowledge of the property, give a limited title guarantee. Where the seller has no title/ questionable title, insert a special condition to negate the implied promise that the seller has good title.

If the landlord grants a lease with full or limited title guarantee, the covenants for title given by seller to buyer will be impliedly given by the landlord to the tenant.

### Vacant Possession

Seller's solicitor must specify by special condition whether the property is being sold with vacant possession or subject to occupational leases. If subject to lease, supply to buyer.

If vacant possession intended, but there is an occupier, it will be necessary to ensure that the person will vacate the property on completion → check the person has no legal interest and any equitable interest was overreached. Good practice to get the occupier to confirm vacation in the contract.

### Date of Completion

- If no date of completion is inserted in the contract on exchange, SC 6.1.1/ SCPC 9.1.1 sets completion as **20 working days** after the date of contract.
- SC 6.1.1/ SCPC 9.1.1: time is not of the essence unless where a notice of completion has been served.
	- This has contract law applications: a delay in completion will not be a repudiatory breach unless time is of the essence.
- Usually, a time on the particular day should also be imposed. Ensure there is sufficient time for the seller to complete dependent purchase.

### Delayed Completion Compensation

SC 6.1.2/ SCPC 9.1.2 states that if the completion monies are received after 2.00 pm then, for the purposes of calculating compensation, completion is deemed to have occurred on the next working day. The 2.00 pm cut off can be changed by special condition if the parties agree.

| Standard conditions | Who pays compensation            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| SC                  | Party at fault pays compensation |
| SCPC                | Buyer pays compensation if he has defaulted and completion is delayed. Buyer has no contractual right to compensation if seller defaults.                                  |

Standard Condition 7.2 (SCPC 10.3) contains provisions for the payment of compensation for  
late completion, and states that the amount of such payment shall be assessed at the ‘contract  
rate’ as defined. According to SC 1.1.1(e) (SCPC 1.1.1(e)), the contract rate, unless altered by  
special condition, is ‘The Law Society’s interest rate from time to time in force’. Set at Barclays base lending rate + 4%.

### Deposit

Customary for buyer to pay a deposit of 10% on exchange of contracts. If the buyer subsequently defaults, the seller would have a right to forfeit the deposit.

SC 2.2/ SCPC 3.2 provides for payment of a 10% deposit to be held by the seller’s solicitor in the capacity of **stakeholder**.

### Indemnity Covenants

To pass on the chain of indemnities, the seller should take an indemnity covenant from the buyer. This may only be included in the transfer if provided for in the contract. SC 4.6.4/ SCPC 7.6.5 makes provision for such an indemnity (but often expressly provided for).

### Fixtures and Fittings

- Fixtures pass automatically, fittings/ chattels do not
- Vary this by special condition if required.

### VAT

Contract should deal with VAT.

## Unfair Contract Terms

Possible application of [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] Part 2 if the contract is between a consumer and trader. In these cases the contract must be transparent and fair. “Fair” does not apply to the contract price, provided it is transparent.

- ‘Consumer’ means an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual’s trade, business, craft or profession (CRA 2015, s 2(1)).
- ‘Trader’ means a person acting for purposes relating to that person’s trade, business, craft or profession, whether acting personally or through another person acting in the trader’s name or on the trader’s behalf (CRA 2015, s 2(2)).

## Buyer's Consideration

- Only make amendments where necessary and relevant.
- A “travelling draft” of the contract will go back and forth between buyer's and seller's solicitors
- A clean copy should be sent to the buyer's solicitor to approve.
- They can return it “approved as drawn”
- Copies to sign (engrossments) produced by seller's solicitor.

See textbook for a checklist.

# Mortgage

See [[Mortgages]].

## Mortgage Offer

- Lender performs due diligence before offering loan
- Then sends borrower an offer setting out terms
	- Residential: 'mortgage offer'
	- Commercial: 'commitment letter' with 'term sheet' attached, followed by 'facility agreement' setting out detailed terms of loan.

## Terms of Offer

 Mortgage offer will include:

 1. Description of property
 2. Amount of advance and period of mortgage
 3. Whether mortgage is repayment or interest-only
 4. Applicable interest rate
 5. Amount of initial monthly repayments.
 6. Insurance details
	 - Where lender is to insure property,
	 - amount of cover and
	 - when cover will start.
 7. Details of repair works lender requires to be carried out to the property.
 8. Amount of any 'guarantee premium' payable by the borrower.
	 - This is insurance taken out to insure the lender against not being able to recover the full amount owing on resale of the property.
	 - Cost borne by lender.
9. Residential: term that any existing mortgage will be discharged before completion of the new loan.

## Conditions

- Ensure client understands conditions and terms attached to the mortgage offer and will be able to comply with them.
- Check the offer to see if the lender requires a formal acceptance of the offer.
- Check whether the mortgage offer is expressed so as not to be legally binding on lender/ subject to a condition allowing the lender to withdraw after formal acceptance (e.g., if there is a material adverse change to market/ borrower).

## Instructions to Act

- The lender will instruct solicitors to act for it.
- In residential cases, usually the same solicitor acts for both the borrower and lender.
- The solicitor must always bear in mind that they owe a duty to both clients ([[Mortgage Express v Bowerman & Partners (A Firm) [1996] 2 All ER 836]]).

### Lender's Handbook

The solicitor must ensure that they carry out their lender client’s instructions as set out in both parts of the Lenders’ Handbook. This contains standardised mortgage instructions.

### BSA Mortgage Instructions

The Building Societies Association (BSA) has developed a set of voluntary mortgage instructions.

## Conflict of Interests

Where there is a conflict of interest which cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of both clients, the solicitor cannot continue to act for both.

Where a conflict of interests exists between the buyer client and the lender client, the solicitor, acting in their capacity of adviser to the buyer, may disclose the nature of the conflict to the lender only with the consent of the buyer client ([[Halifax Mortgage Services v Stepsky [1996] 1 FLR 620]]).

Note that the solicitor’s duty of confidentiality to the buyer is discharged in a case of mortgage fraud.

## Reporting to Lender

The lender will want to know whether the property is adequate security for the loan and has a 'good and marketable' title. Standard forms which can be used.

## Mortgage Documentation

### Residential

A mortgage of a residential property to be used as the borrower’s home or a simple commercial property loan granted by an institutional lender (such as a high street bank or building society) is likely to involve a single mortgage deed in the lender’s standard form. This usually incorporates standard terms.

### Commercial

For a complex loan secured on commercial property, there may be a loan agreement (sometimes called a facility letter or credit agreement) and a separate charge by way of legal mortgage, or a debenture incorporating a charge by way of legal mortgage.

Will usually include:

1. Commercial details of the transaction
2. Property charged by way of legal mortgage
	- Creates an interest in favour of the lender equivalent to a 3,000-year lease (or for a leasehold, a term of one day less than the lease).
- The document which charges the property will be a deed.
- Potentially additional security (fixed and floating charges)
- Statement of liabilities owed by the borrower to the lender.
	- Often includes an 'all monies charge' securing any sums owed by the borrower to the lender.
- Require borrower to make representations and warranties about status
- Borrower enters into covenants relating to the property (e.g., keeping it in repair)
- Set out events of default
- Extend statutory powers of sale, leasing, accepting surrenders and exclude s 93 LPA 1925,
	- allowing the lender to refuse to discharge the mortgage until all loans secured have been repaid ('consolidation')
- Prohibit borrower from creating any other mortgages over the property.
	- Gives lender the power to refuse any request by the borrower to take out another loan secured on the property from a different lender.
	- First lender may want to make further advance to the borrower and ensure this is secured by the first legal mortgage (“tacking”). But tacking is complicated and simpler to prohibit subsequent mortgages.

> [!note] Floating charges
> 
> Where the lender has also taken a floating charge, the negative pledge supports the floating charge and gives it effective priority. A properly registered first legal mortgage will automatically have priority over any legal mortgage created later in time. Any second mortgage that is granted in favour of a new lender will take priority over the floating charge unless the new lender has notice of the negative pledge at the time it takes the security. If it does have notice, priority is reversed and the new lender’s security, although valid, will rank behind the floating charge. So, a negative pledge is an effective way to prevent the borrower creating a second mortgage which would take priority over the first lender’s floating charge.

The borrower’s solicitor is under an obligation to explain the nature and effect of the mortgage documentation to the client in whatever level of detail is appropriate.

## Protecting Security

Carry out pre-completion searches. Register mortgage at Companies House and Land Registry.

# Deposit

It is usual for a buyer to pay the seller 10% of the purchase price on exchange of contracts (SC 2.2, SCPC 3.2). In law, a deposit is unnecessary.

The payment of the deposit acts as part payment of the purchase price, and demonstrates the buyer's intentions to complete the contract.

## Preliminary Deposit

Neither side needs to pay a preliminary deposit. An estate agent may ask for a deposit. Ensure the agent has the seller's authority to receive the deposit, since otherwise the buyer has no recourse against the seller if the agent misappropriates the money ([[Sorrell v Finch [1977] AC 728]]).

## Deposit Amount

If asked by the seller to accept a deposit of $<10\%$, the seller should consider:

1. The risk of the sale not proceeding.
2. The amount of the buyer's mortgage offer.
3. Likely loss if the buyer defaulted (e.g., cost of bridging finance, cost of resale).

The seller’s solicitor must explain the consequences of taking a reduced deposit to their client  
and obtain their client’s express authority before agreeing to accept a reduced deposit. Only in exceptional circumstances should the transaction proceed without deposit. The deposit payable should take into account any preliminary deposit.

- SC 2.2.1: 10% of the purchase price, not including the price payable for any contents included
- SCPC 3.2.1: 10% of the purchase price, which may include chattels depending on special conditions.

## Funding Deposit

Obtain instructions from the buyer client. Funding may be:

- From an investment account
	- Check notice needed to withdraw funds
	- Withdrawing too early $\implies$ interest lost.
- Bridging finance
	- May be needed where the buyer does not have sufficient funds on exchange of contracts.
	- Often solicitor must undertake to repay the bridging loan out of proceeds of sale of the client's existing property
	- Advise on costs and risks. But remember that a secured bridging loan is a **regulated mortgage contract** for the purposes of FSMA 2000.
- Deposit guarantee
	- Insurance policy bought by the seller and tendered to the seller on exchange, in place of paying a money deposit.
	- Obtain seller's permission and amend contract to be for payment by way of guarantee.
- Use of deposit from a related sale
	- Applicable for a residential property.

## Clearing Funds

Buyer's solicitor must ensure that the deposit is received with enough time to be cleared through the client account before withdrawn from.

## Capacity in Which Deposit is Held

Both sets of Standard Conditions provide for the deposit to be held by an auctioneer as agent (SC 2.3.6 and SCPC 3.3.6) but by a conveyancer as stakeholder (SC 2.2.6 and SCPC 3.2.2). **EXCEPTION**: SC 2.2.5 allows the seller to use the deposit as a deposit on a related purchase of a house for the seller’s residence, provided that in such related purchase it will be held on the same terms as SC 2.2.5 and 2.2.6.

> [!warning]
> Until exchange, the deposit is held to the order of the buyer's solicitor. Only once exchange has taken place will the deposit be held as stakeholder until completion (SCPC 3.2.2).

Details:

1. Agent for the seller
	- Agent may hand money over to the seller before completion.
	- Advantageous for the seller.
	- The buyer has a lien over the property until completion, but may have difficulty recovering the money if the seller defaults.
	- In the auction context, this is common to allow the auctioneer to complete building work etc.
2. Agent for the buyer
	- Rarely used
3. Stakeholder.
	- Secure middleman
	- SC 2.2.5 exception: the deposit may be passed along a chain of purchases, but will ultimately be held by a solicitor as stakeholder.

## Paying Deposit

Standard Condition 2.2.4 and SCPC 3.2.2 require the deposit to be paid by electronic means from a solicitor’s account with a clearing bank to the seller’s solicitor’s bank account. Under the SCs, it is also permissible to use a cheque drawn on a solicitor’s or licensed conveyancer’s client bank account.

## Cheque Bounces

If a cheque taken in payment of the deposit bounces, this constitutes a fundamental breach of contract which gives the seller the option either of keeping the contract alive, or of treating the contract as discharged by the breach, and in either event of suing for damages ([[Millichamp v Jones [1983] 1 All ER 267]]).

If the deposit cheque bounces, SC 2.2.2 allows the seller to give notice to the buyer that the  
contract has been discharged by his breach, provided that he does so within seven working  
days of his being informed of the cheque being dishonoured.

## Interest on Deposit

Where the deposit is held by a solicitor, irrespective of the capacity in which the money is held, interest may be payable under r 7.1 Accounts Rules. SC 2.2.6/ SCPC 3.2.2 provides that where the deposit, or part of it, is held in the capacity of stakeholder, interest on the deposit will be payable to the seller on completion.

## Buyer's Lien

If paying the deposit to the seller in their capacity as agent, the buyer has a lien over the property for the amount of the deposit. Enforceable by court order and may be protected as a notice (registered land). Unusual to register the lien.

# Insurance

## Risk to Property

At common law, and under both sets of Standard Conditions, the risk of accidental damage to the property passes to the buyer from the moment of exchange of contracts, unless the loss/ damage was attributable to the seller's lack of care ([[Clarke v Ramuz [1891] 2 QB 456]]).

A solicitor who fails to advise on the consequences of failing to insure will be liable in negligence, if the client suffers loss due to lack of insurance.

## Insuring Property

Either:

1. Note that the property is on a block policy held by the buyer's solicitor, covering all properties handled by the firm
2. If there is a mortgage, the lender will usually insure on the request of the buyer's solicitor. Check that the cover will be adequate, the property will be covered from the date of exchange of contracts, and the insurance requirements do not conflict with the terms of the contract/ any lease.
3. Buyer takes out insurance themselves.

### FSMA

To advise on arranging an insurance contract, rely on the "professional firms exemption". Firm must be registered in the FCA Register and must appoint a compliance officer.

## Seller's Risk

Commonly, for new property in the course of construction, the property remains at the seller's risk until completion. If acting for the seller, exclude s 47 LPA 1925 (so buyer can't claim off seller's insurance).

## Buyer's Risk

SC 5.1.2 and SCPC 8.2.4(a) provide that the seller is under no obligation to insure the property, except where required by the terms of any lease or the contract of sale. It is therefore essential for a buyer to take out his own policy of insurance as from exchange.

In practice, it is likely that the seller will keep up his policy until completion, and if the seller has a mortgage, he will be required to do so.

> [!question] What if there are two policies?
> There is a dnager that on a claim being made, each insurance firm would reduce the payout based on the existence of the other police. SC 5.1.5, SCPC 8.2.4(b): if there is a reduction to the payment made to the buyer for this reason, the purchase price is to be reduced accordingly. 

Except where the seller is required by a condition of the contract of sale or his mortgage or lease to maintain his policy, he could cancel his insurance policy on exchange of contracts, but in practice he would be unwise to do so (eg, in case the buyer failed to complete).

## Other Insurance

Where appropriate, the buyer should take out contents insurance, life assurance etc. If a solicitor is advising, this raises FSMA regulated investment considerations.

# Preparing for Exchange

On exchange, a binding contract comes into existence.

## Stuff to Check

- Searches
- Financial arrangements
- Deposit
- Contract
- Insurance
- Completion date
- Method of exchange
- Signature of contract
- Occupiers

## Reporting to Client

When searches and enquiries are complete and the draft contract has been agreed, the buyer's solicitor should report to their client in writing (“Buyer's Report”).

## Signature

Both parties must sign the contract (or each sign identical copies) – s 2 LP(MP)A 1989. Signatures do not need to be witnessed. Signature by an authorised agent is acceptable.

- Tell the client explicitly where and how to sign. Request a cheque for the deposit, indicating the due date.
- A solicitor needs their client's express authority to sign a contract on behalf of their client. Should be obtained in writing after explaining the consequences.
- An officer of a company can usually sign on behalf of the company, if the transaction is authorised.
- Electronic signatures are fine (Law Society Practice Note, 2016).
- Ensure all email correspondence is marked "subject to contract", else [[Neocleous v Rees [2019] EWHC 2462 (Ch)]] - an automatically generated email footer containing name and address could amount to an enforceable contract.
- Ensure the client's authority has been obtained prior to exchange.

# Exchange of Contracts

## Legality

Physical exchange of contracts is not a legal requirements, though this is common practice. When two parts are physically exchanged, the time at which a binding contract comes into being depends on the method used.

If a single document is signed by both parties, the contract becomes binding and enforceable as soon as the second signature has been put on the document ([[Smith v Mansi [1962] 3 All ER 857]]).

A solicitor who exchanges contracts without their client’s express or implied authority to do  
so will be liable to the client in negligence.

SC 2.1 and SCPC 3.1 allow contracts to be exchange by DX, post or telephone using Law Society formulae.

## Methods of Exchange

Usually exchanged in person or by telephone. Once contracts have been exchanged, neither party can withdraw. Parties' solicitors must check all necessary requirements. Exchange of contracts and completion dates must be synchronised.

### Telephone

Most common method, since legal recognition in [[Domb v Isoz [1980] 1 All ER 942]]. The contract becomes effective as soon as the parties' solicitors agree in the course of a telephone conversation that exchange has taken place. Then contracts are exchanged by post.

Problem: neither party can check the other's contract is signed, or is in the agreed form incorporating all amendments. If parts not identical/ either unsigned, there is no contract.

So to avoid doubt, the party's solicitors agree in advance that the telephonic exchange will be governed by one of the Law Society's formulae:

| Formula   | Usage                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Formula A | Where one solicitor (usually seller's) already holds both parts of the contract before exchange initiated.                       |
| Formula B | Where at the time of the telephone exchange, each party's solicitor is still in possession of their own client's signed contract |
| Formula C | In chain transactions.                                                                                                                                  |

The client's express authority to exchange must be obtained before the procedure is commenced.

#### Formula A

- Little used in practice, but safest.
- Buyer's solicitor sent buyer's part of the contract, together with the deposit amount, to the seller's solicitor.
- Buyer's solicitor phones seller's solicitor and agree a completion date.
- Seller's Solicitor confirms they hold their client's part of the contract duly signed by the client and in the agreed form → MOMENT OF EXCHANGE.
- Seller's solicitor undertakes to send their client's part of the contract to the buyer solicitor the same day.

#### Formula B

- Most common
- Each solicitor still holds their own client's part of the contract.
- Both confirm that respective parts are signed and in the agreed form -> EXCHANGE.
- Both undertake
	- To hold signed part of contract to the other's order
	- To send respective parts of the contract to the other
- Buyer undertakes to send deposit.

#### Formula C

- Designed for chain transactions but a bit complex
- Part I
	- Parties initially agree that they hold signed parts of the contract.
	- Each party undertakes that they will exchange, provided the other party contracts them by a specified time later in the day
	- Gives buyer and seller time to enter into any dependent contract.
- Part II
	- Activated when contact made by the specified time
	- Usually a provision for the buyer and seller to make use of a deposit due under a dependent sale.

> [!warning]
> Before using Formula C, the client's express permission to use the formula must have been obtained. 

### Personal Exchange

Physical exchange of contracts in person. Often used in high value commercial contracts.

### Postal Exchange

Buyer's solicitor sends the client's signed contract and deposit cheque to the seller's solicitor, who will post their client's signed contract back to the buyer. Note the postal rule applies ([[Adams v Lindsell (1818) 1 B & Ald 681]] – effective on posting). Not a satisfactory method if there is a chain of transactions.

### Document Exchange

Basically a private postal service. The postal rule does not apply to DX.

## Insurance

> [!action]
> If the buyer is to insure the property from exchange, the buyer's solicitor should after exchange immediately telephone the lender/ insurer.
