# Introduction

## Conveyancing

Conveyancing means the transfer and creation of interests in land.

Law of property is somewhat unique, for a couple of reasons:

- Land is comparatively complex
- Big money involved.

We'll do things chronologically.

Land law is a tool to address client needs, rather than the subject of study itself.

## Unregistered Land

Documents proving ownership collectively called title deeds. Seller must show buyer 15 years of their undisputed ownership.

Logic: after 15 years, fair to assume that the person is indeed the owner. If anyone else has rights, assumed they would not have let the seller remain for so long without claiming possession.

This is cumbersome and expensive, as well as open to forgery.

## Registered Land

Central register of land ownership with the Government. Sets out benefits and burdens on the land.

Remember that the systems work in parallel, there remains lots of land which is unregistered. Only from 01/04/98, changes of ownership following death and gifts of land became compulsorily registrable. Registration only occurs when there is a triggering event.

## E-conveyancing

The Land Registration (Amendment) Rules 2018 (SI 2018/70), which came into force on 6 April 2018, allow for registrable dispositions of registered land to be carried out using electronic documents with electronic signatures.  
However, this is only available when the Chief Land Registrar is satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place and publishes a notice to this effect. At the time of writing, no such  
notice has been published by the Chief Land Registrar.

Nonetheless, certain e-services are already provided by Land Registry through two online channels, the portal and Business Gateway.

But the process is today predominantly paper based.
