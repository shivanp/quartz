# Exchange of Contracts

## Legality

Physical exchange of contracts is not a legal requirements, though this is common practice. When two parts are physically exchanged, the time at which a binding contract comes into being depends on the method used.

If a single document is signed by both parties, the contract becomes binding and enforceable as soon as the second signature has been put on the document ([[Smith v Mansi [1962] 3 All ER 857]]).

A solicitor who exchanges contracts without their client’s express or implied authority to do  
so will be liable to the client in negligence.

SC 2.1 and SCPC 3.1 allow contracts to be exchange by DX, post or telephone using Law Society formulae.

## Methods of Exchange

Usually exchanged in person or by telephone. Once contracts have been exchanged, neither party can withdraw. Parties' solicitors must check all necessary requirements. Exchange of contracts and completion dates must be synchronised.

### Telephone

Most common method, since legal recognition in [[Domb v Isoz [1980] 1 All ER 942]]. The contract becomes effective as soon as the parties' solicitors agree in the course of a telephone conversation that exchange has taken place. Then contracts are exchanged by post.

Problem: neither party can check the other's contract is signed, or is in the agreed form incorporating all amendments. If parts not identical/ either unsigned, there is no contract.

So to avoid doubt, the party's solicitors agree in advance that the telephonic exchange will be governed by one of the Law Society's formulae:

| Formula   | Usage                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Formula A | Where one solicitor (usually seller's) already holds both parts of the contract before exchange initiated.                       |
| Formula B | Where at the time of the telephone exchange, each party's solicitor is still in possession of their own client's signed contract |
| Formula C | In chain transactions.                                                                                                                                  |

The client's express authority to exchange must be obtained before the procedure is commenced.

#### Formula A

- Little used in practice, but safest.
- Buyer's solicitor sent buyer's part of the contract, together with the deposit amount, to the seller's solicitor.
- Buyer's solicitor phones seller's solicitor and agree a completion date.
- Seller's Solicitor confirms they hold their client's part of the contract duly signed by the client and in the agreed form → MOMENT OF EXCHANGE.
- Seller's solicitor undertakes to send their client's part of the contract to the buyer solicitor the same day.

#### Formula B

- Most common
- Each solicitor still holds their own client's part of the contract.
- Both confirm that respective parts are signed and in the agreed form -> EXCHANGE.
- Both undertake
	- To hold signed part of contract to the other's order
	- To send respective parts of the contract to the other
- Buyer undertakes to send deposit.

#### Formula C

- Designed for chain transactions but a bit complex
- Part I
	- Parties initially agree that they hold signed parts of the contract.
	- Each party undertakes that they will exchange, provided the other party contracts them by a specified time later in the day
	- Gives buyer and seller time to enter into any dependent contract.
- Part II
	- Activated when contact made by the specified time
	- Usually a provision for the buyer and seller to make use of a deposit due under a dependent sale.

> [!warning]
> Before using Formula C, the client's express permission to use the formula must have been obtained. 

### Personal Exchange

Physical exchange of contracts in person. Often used in high value commercial contracts.

### Postal Exchange

Buyer's solicitor sends the client's signed contract and deposit cheque to the seller's solicitor, who will post their client's signed contract back to the buyer. Note the postal rule applies ([[Adams v Lindsell (1818) 1 B & Ald 681]] – effective on posting). Not a satisfactory method if there is a chain of transactions.

### Document Exchange

Basically a private postal service. The postal rule does not apply to DX.

## Insurance

> [!action]
> If the buyer is to insure the property from exchange, the buyer's solicitor should after exchange immediately telephone the lender/ insurer.
