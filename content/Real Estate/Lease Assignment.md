# Lease Assignment

An assignment arises in 2 contexts:

1. Residential
	1. Usually prohibited for short-term residential lettings.
	2. Assignment common for a long lease.
2. Commercial.
	1. Usually leases are at market value and have no capital value.
	2. So no purchase price will be paid by the assignee to the assignor on the assignment.

Seller used to denote the assignor and buyer the assignee. The terms of the lease are not open to negotiation by the buyer – the lease is already in existence. An alteration to the lease can only be made by negotiating a deed of variation of the lease with the landlord.

## Pre-contract Matters - Seller

- Seller's solicitor investigates title
	- Check the superior freehold title as part of this process.
	- Any covenants/ easements binding the freehold also bind the leasehold.
- Investigation of title to check terms of the lease and anticipate problems.
	- Check whether landlord consent to the transaction is required.
	- If a mortgage is taken out to aid the purchase, the lender will usually require a minimum stated length of the term remains unexpired at the date of the acquisition of the buyer's interest.

## Pre-contract Package

Seller's solicitor should provide the buyer's solicitor with:

- Draft lease
- Copy lease
- Evidence of title
- Any licence permitting assignment to current/ previous tenants
- Insurance policy relating to the property & receipt of last payment
- Receipt for last payments of rent and service charge on the property
- Details of management company, if applicable.

### Energy Performance Certificates

EPCs generally required when a building is constructed, sold or rented out. So required on assignments. EPC valid for 10 years unless a new EPC is issued.

## Pre-contract Matters – Buyer

- Buyer must investigate title and consider the terms of the draft contract.
- Seller's solicitor will have supplied a copy of the lease, which should be checked carefully and problems identified.
- Buyer's solicitor should make the same searches as on the purchase of a freehold.

## Landlord's Consent

Commercial leases usually provide for the landlord's consent to be obtained before assignment. Consent to assign, usually embodied in a licence to assign. Covenants controlling the tenant's freedom to assign also control alienation (sub-letting/ charging the property).

### References

The landlord will want to take up references on the prospective buyer to ensure the buyer is solvent and trustworthy. Commonly required from:

- A current landlord
- Buyer's bankers
- Buyer's employer
- Professional person
- Person or company with whom the buyer regularly trades
- 3 years' audited accounts for a company/ self-employed person.

### Surety

The landlord may require a surety (guarantor) to the lease as a condition of the grant of consent. The landlord may require the seller to enter an AGA to guarantee the performance of the tenant's covenants by the buyer.

- Often inserted in the lease as a pre-condition to giving consent (in which case it can be insisted on, regardless of reasonableness).
- If not, can be requested if reasonable.

### Absolute Covenants

If the covenant against alienation is absolute:

- Any assignment will be effective
- But will be a breach of covenant by the tenant and may leased to the forfeiture of the lease.

T may ask L to grant a variation of the lease to permit assignment, but no obligation for L to consent/ give reasons for refusal.

### Qualified Covenants

Permits the tenant to assign, provided the seller tenant obtains the prior consent of the landlord to the dealing. **s 19 LTA 1927** converts this to fully qualified – such consent must not be withheld unreasonably by the landlord.

LTA 1998: the landlord must, upon being served with a written request for consent, give consent within a reasonable time unless it is reasonable to withhold consent. Written notice of decision must be served on the tenant within a reasonable time, stating any conditions attached to consent/ reasons for withholding. Breach = breach of statutory duty (in tort) $\rightarrow$ tenant gets damages.

> [!warning]
> The obligations under the 1988 Act will not be triggered unless the written application for consent has been correctly served on the landlord. In [[EON UK plc v Gilespor ts Ltd [2012] EWHC 2172 (Ch)]], the landlord’s statutory duties
> under the 1988 Act were not triggered by an application for consent to assign made by the tenant via email - since the lease did not allow service by email.

In leases of commercial property granted on or after 01/01/96, the lease may provide for the circumstances in which the landlord would withhold his consent to an assignment and any conditions subject to which such consent will be granted (Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995). A landlord will not be withholding his consent unreasonably if he insists on compliance with these conditions.

In an old commercial lease, it is common to have a requirement that the buyer enter into a direct covenant with the landlord to comply with the covenants of the lease. $\implies$ buyer remains liable on the covenants even after a subsequent disposition.

### Demanding Premium

Landlord cannot demand a premium as a condition for consent – unless the lease specifically allows this.

### Costs Undertaking

The landlord is entitled to ask the tenant to pay the landlord’s solicitor’s reasonable charges in connection with the preparation of the deed of consent (licence to assign). On the assignment of a commercial lease, it is usual for the landlord’s solicitors to require an undertaking from the seller’s solicitors for the payment of the costs, although it is not clear whether it is reasonable to insist on such an undertaking.

> [!action]
> The seller’s solicitor should first seek their client’s authority to give the undertaking, the undertaking should be limited to the reasonable costs incurred, and a cap on such costs could also be sought.

### SCPC

- SCPC 11.3.3 requires the seller to enter into an AGA, if it is lawfully required.
- SCPC 11.3.5 further provides that if the landlord’s consent has not been obtained by the completion date, completion is postponed until five working days after the seller notifies the buyer that consent has been given.
- The contract may not be rescinded until six months have passed since the original completion date (SCPC 11.3.6).

### Protocol for Applications for Consent to Assign or Sublet

Protocol created by law firms, intended to establish good practice. Non-binding.

## Title

### Absolute Title

Seller must provide the buyer with:

- Official copies of the register and title plan (SCPC 7.1.2)
- A copy of the lease (SCPC 11.1.2)

The buyer is then to be treated as entering into the contract knowing and fully accepting the lease terms (SCPC 11.1.2). In any event, due to the Open Registry rules, the buyer can always inspect the seller’s title. Since the title to the lease is guaranteed by Land Registry, there is no need for the buyer to investigate the title to the freehold or superior leases.

### Good Leasehold Title

Registration with a good leasehold title provides no guarantee of the soundness of the title to the freehold reversion and thus, although not entitled under the general law to do so, the buyer should insist on deduction of the superior title to him. The provision for deduction of the reversionary title must be dealt with by a special condition in the contract, because neither set of standard conditions deals with this point. Without deduction of the reversionary title, the lease may be unacceptable to the buyer and/or his lender.

## Transfer Deed

- Transfer legal title to an estate in land by deed (s 52(1) LPA 1925).
- Transfer deed for assignment often called a “deed of assignment”.
- Assignment of an existing registered lease: **use Form TR1**.
- For an unregistered lease, use deed of assignment for the assignment of a lease of 7 years or less.

### Covenants for Title

If a seller is in breach of a repairing covenant in the lease, the lack of repair could involve him in liability to the buyer after completion under the covenants for title, which will be implied in the transfer deed. Where the seller sells with full or limited title guarantee, the covenants for title include a promise that the seller has complied with the tenant’s covenants in the lease, including repair.

> [!note]
> Seller should **not** make any promises about repiar, because *caveat emptor* applies.

There is a conflict here between the promise implied by the covenants for title and caveat emptor. It is resolved by modifying the covenants for title to bring them into line with caveat emptor (SCPC 4.2.2 and 7.6.4) by excluding references to repair. This type of contractual condition must be reflected by an express modification of the implied covenants for title in the transfer deed itself (usually box 9 or 11 of TR1).

>The covenants set out in section 4 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994 will not extend to any breach of the tenant’s covenants in the lease relating to the physical state of the property.

### Indemnity

- Assignment of leases granted before 1 January 1996
	- Indemnity covenant from the buyer to the seller is implied except where, in unregistered land, value is not given by the buyer for the transaction (LPA 1925, s 77).
- Assignment of leases granted on or after 1 January 1996
	- The seller will usually automatically be released for future liability on the assignment and so will not require indemnity.
	- If, however, the seller is to remain liable (e.g., under the terms of an AGA), an express indemnity covenant between the buyer and the seller should be included in the transfer deed.
	- SCPC 7.6.5 entitles the seller to insert an indemnity in such circumstances.

## Preparing for Completion

- Buyer's solicitor prepared transfer deed
- Pre-completion searches
	- Company search (if applicable)
	- Title searches
		- Registered lease
			- Official searches of leasehold title to check for any new entries and to gain a priority period.
			- If lease has good leasehold title:
				- If freehold is registered, official search against the freehold to check for any new entries
				- If freehold unregistered, land charges department search against estate owners.
		- Unregistered lease
			- Land charges department search against estate owners of leasehold.
			- Land charges search against freehold estate owners (if freehold unregistered)
			- Official search of freehold (if registered).
- Landlord's consent
	- Landlord's solicitor supplies the engrossment of the licence (usually by deed)
	- Usually drawn up in counterparts.
- Apportionments
	- Seller supplies buyer with completion statement showing the amounts due, together with receipts/ statements.
	- Often a provisional apportionment is made on a best estimates basis (SCPC 9.3.5).
