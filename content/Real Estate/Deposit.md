# Deposit

It is usual for a buyer to pay the seller 10% of the purchase price on exchange of contracts (SC 2.2, SCPC 3.2). In law, a deposit is unnecessary.

The payment of the deposit acts as part payment of the purchase price, and demonstrates the buyer's intentions to complete the contract.

## Preliminary Deposit

Neither side needs to pay a preliminary deposit. An estate agent may ask for a deposit. Ensure the agent has the seller's authority to receive the deposit, since otherwise the buyer has no recourse against the seller if the agent misappropriates the money ([[Sorrell v Finch [1977] AC 728]]).

## Deposit Amount

If asked by the seller to accept a deposit of $<10\%$, the seller should consider:

1. The risk of the sale not proceeding.
2. The amount of the buyer's mortgage offer.
3. Likely loss if the buyer defaulted (e.g., cost of bridging finance, cost of resale).

The seller’s solicitor must explain the consequences of taking a reduced deposit to their client  
and obtain their client’s express authority before agreeing to accept a reduced deposit. Only in exceptional circumstances should the transaction proceed without deposit. The deposit payable should take into account any preliminary deposit.

- SC 2.2.1: 10% of the purchase price, not including the price payable for any contents included
- SCPC 3.2.1: 10% of the purchase price, which may include chattels depending on special conditions.

## Funding Deposit

Obtain instructions from the buyer client. Funding may be:

- From an investment account
	- Check notice needed to withdraw funds
	- Withdrawing too early $\implies$ interest lost.
- Bridging finance
	- May be needed where the buyer does not have sufficient funds on exchange of contracts.
	- Often solicitor must undertake to repay the bridging loan out of proceeds of sale of the client's existing property
	- Advise on costs and risks. But remember that a secured bridging loan is a **regulated mortgage contract** for the purposes of FSMA 2000.
- Deposit guarantee
	- Insurance policy bought by the seller and tendered to the seller on exchange, in place of paying a money deposit.
	- Obtain seller's permission and amend contract to be for payment by way of guarantee.
- Use of deposit from a related sale
	- Applicable for a residential property.

## Clearing Funds

Buyer's solicitor must ensure that the deposit is received with enough time to be cleared through the client account before withdrawn from.

## Capacity in Which Deposit is Held

Both sets of Standard Conditions provide for the deposit to be held by an auctioneer as agent (SC 2.3.6 and SCPC 3.3.6) but by a conveyancer as stakeholder (SC 2.2.6 and SCPC 3.2.2). **EXCEPTION**: SC 2.2.5 allows the seller to use the deposit as a deposit on a related purchase of a house for the seller’s residence, provided that in such related purchase it will be held on the same terms as SC 2.2.5 and 2.2.6.

> [!warning]
> Until exchange, the deposit is held to the order of the buyer's solicitor. Only once exchange has taken place will the deposit be held as stakeholder until completion (SCPC 3.2.2).

Details:

1. Agent for the seller
	- Agent may hand money over to the seller before completion.
	- Advantageous for the seller.
	- The buyer has a lien over the property until completion, but may have difficulty recovering the money if the seller defaults.
	- In the auction context, this is common to allow the auctioneer to complete building work etc.
2. Agent for the buyer
	- Rarely used
3. Stakeholder.
	- Secure middleman
	- SC 2.2.5 exception: the deposit may be passed along a chain of purchases, but will ultimately be held by a solicitor as stakeholder.

## Paying Deposit

Standard Condition 2.2.4 and SCPC 3.2.2 require the deposit to be paid by electronic means from a solicitor’s account with a clearing bank to the seller’s solicitor’s bank account. Under the SCs, it is also permissible to use a cheque drawn on a solicitor’s or licensed conveyancer’s client bank account.

## Cheque Bounces

If a cheque taken in payment of the deposit bounces, this constitutes a fundamental breach of contract which gives the seller the option either of keeping the contract alive, or of treating the contract as discharged by the breach, and in either event of suing for damages ([[Millichamp v Jones [1983] 1 All ER 267]]).

If the deposit cheque bounces, SC 2.2.2 allows the seller to give notice to the buyer that the  
contract has been discharged by his breach, provided that he does so within seven working  
days of his being informed of the cheque being dishonoured.

## Interest on Deposit

Where the deposit is held by a solicitor, irrespective of the capacity in which the money is held, interest may be payable under r 7.1 Accounts Rules. SC 2.2.6/ SCPC 3.2.2 provides that where the deposit, or part of it, is held in the capacity of stakeholder, interest on the deposit will be payable to the seller on completion.

## Buyer's Lien

If paying the deposit to the seller in their capacity as agent, the buyer has a lien over the property for the amount of the deposit. Enforceable by court order and may be protected as a notice (registered land). Unusual to register the lien.
