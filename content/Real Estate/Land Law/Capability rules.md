## Capability Rules

As an easement is a very powerful right in land, there are strict tests which must be met before a right can be recognised as an easement rather than simply a personal right.

1. To be a legal easement the right must fall within the definition set out in [LPA 1925, s 1(2)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1) as to duration. If the right has not been granted or reserved for the equivalent of a freehold or leasehold estate, then it can only be equitable LPA 1925, s 1(3).
2. The right must be capable in principle of being an easement. It must satisfy the tests laid down in [[Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131]].
3. The right must not be prevented from being an easement by the presence of one of the ‘disqualifying factors’:
	1. additional compulsory expenditure by the servient owner;
	2. use which amounts to exclusive possession; or
	3. permission.
4. The right must have been acquired as an easement. This can be done in one of three ways:
	1. by complying with the statutory formalities for an express grant or reservation;
	2. by acquired impliedly by one of the recognised methods; or
	3. by being acquired by prescription or long use.

## Test in *Re Ellenborough Park*

> [!test] Test: Characteristics of an easement
> 
> Quoting Dr Cheshire’s _Modern Real Property_ Evershed MR set out four essential characteristics of an easement:
> - There must be a dominant and servient tenement
> - The right must accommodate the dominant tenement
> - There must be diversity of ownership
> - The right must ‘lie in grant’

### Dominant and Servient Tenement

There must be two identifiable pieces of land: one which benefits from the exercise of the right (the dominant tenement/ land), and one which is burdened by its exercise (the servient tenement/land): [[London & Blenheim Estates Ltd v Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd [1992] ]].

This means that an easement cannot exist ‘in gross’ [[Hawkins v Rutter [1892] 1 QB 668]]. It cannot be exercised by the holder independently of the land: that would be a licence or personal right. An easement cannot exist unless there is a dominant tenement which benefits.

> [!example]
> B sells land to A and grants a right of way to A over B’s land. A’s land is the dominant land benefitting from right of way while B’s retained land is servient land burdened by the right of way.

### Right Must Accommodate the Dominant Tenement

Lord Oliver’s test from a covenants case [[P&A Swift Investments Ltd v Combined English Stores Group plc [1989] AC 632]] is helpful here:

> [!test] Test: Accommodating dominant tenement
> 
> The right must have some direct beneficial impact on the dominant tenement:
> 1. The right only benefits the dominant owner whilst they own dominant land.
> 2. The right should affect nature, quality, use or value of dominant land
> 3. The right should not be expressly personal.

Useful questions to ask are:

- Does the right benefit any owner of the land?
- Does it cease to be of use once the dominant owner has parted with the land?
- Does the right make the dominant land a better or more convenient property?
- Does the right add value or amenity to the dominant land?

#### Benefits Land, Not Individual

Problems arise when the right appears to benefit a business as well as the land. It is sometimes difficult to see whether a right benefits the land itself, or simply benefits a business run from that land.

In [[Hill v Tupper (1863) 2 H&C 121]] the right claimed as an easement was a right to put boats on a canal which adjoined the claimant’s land. The right did not accommodate the dominant tenement, as it did not benefit the land itself: it simply benefitted the business which the claimant happened to carry out on the land.

However, [[Moody v Steggles (1879) 12 ChD 261]] shows that a right which facilitates a business carried out on land can be an easement.

The question is whether the business is a necessary incident to the use of the land, or is a completely unconnected business.

#### Proximity

The final requirement for a right to accommodate the dominant tenement is that the dominant and servient land must be sufficiently proximate to each other. Normally the dominant and servient land will be adjoining, but this need not be the case. In [[Pugh v Savage [1970] 2 QB 373]] there was a right of way over one field to get to another. There was a third field in the middle. The right of way was still held to benefit the dominant tenement, even though the dominant and servient tenements weren’t adjoining. They were close enough for the dominant land to derive a benefit from the right.

> [!example]
> B sells land to A and grants a right of way to A over B’s land. C owns land between A’s and B’s land. However, this does not mean there is not proximity because A’s land is close enough to B’s land to benefit from the right of way.

In *Brevan* this is presented as a series of glosses on the accommodation requirement, known as the Ellenberg Park glosses:

- Gloss 1: normal enjoyment
- Gloss 2: proximity
- Gloss 3: more than personal advantage
- Gloss 4: mere recreation, amusement, and sporting rights as [[easements]]

### No Common Ownership of Two Tenements

The dominant and servient land must be owned by different people. It is not possible for an owner to claim an easement over their own land: [[ Roe v Siddons (1888) 22 QBD 224]]. Benefits enjoyed over one’s own land are called quasi-easements and are capable of becoming [[easements]] if the land is ever partitioned.

> [!note]
> ‘Ownership’ could be ownership of a freehold or a leasehold estate. A may own a freehold and sell part of that freehold to B. Alternatively A may own a freehold and lease part of that land to B. In each case there is diversity of ownership.

Conversely, if the dominant and servient land ever came back into common ownership, any easements enjoyed by the would be extinguished.

> [!example]
> For example, if C owns the freehold of land and grants a lease of part of it to D, there is diversity of ownership, and C may grant [[easements]] to D.
> 
> When D’s lease comes to an end, C is once again the sole freehold owner of all of the land. Any [[easements]] which existed for the benefit of the leasehold land will be extinguished.
> 
> In the same way, if C owns the freehold of land and sells part of it to D, there is diversity of ownership and C may grant easements to D.
> 
> If C were to buy D’s land back again; or D were to buy C’s land, or E were to buy C’s and D’s land, the land is once again in sole ownership. Any [[easements]] which existed for the benefit D’s land would be extinguished.

### Right Must Lie in Grant

The right must be capable of forming the subject-matter of a deed. In other words:

- The right must be granted by a capable grantor to a capable grantee. The person who grants the right must have the power to do so. They must be over 18 and own the legal estate. The grantee must also be capable. For example, it would not be possible to grant an easement to a group e.g., ‘the residents of the village’ as the body of people can change.
- The right must be capable of reasonably exact description. The nature and extent of right must be clear enough for the court to know exactly what is to be enforced, by reference to a plan, for example. Rights that are too vague will not be enforced. For example, a right to ‘a scenic view’ was rejected in [[William Aldreds Case [1610] 9 Co Rep 57b]]
- The right must be judicially recognised. The right should be within the general nature of rights traditionally recognised as [[easements]]. These include:
	- Right of way: [[Borman v Griffith [1930] 1 Ch 493]]
	- Right of drainage and other rights through pipelines: [[Atwood v Bovis Homes [2001] Ch 371]]
	- Right of support: [[Dalton v Angus & Co (1881) 6 App Cas 740]]
	- Right to use sporting and leisure facilities: [[Regency Villas Title Ltd v Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd [2018] UKSC 57]]
	- Right to use land for recreational purposes: [[Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131]]

Even if a right has not previously been recognised as an easement, it can still be capable of being one as the list of easements is not exhaustive: [[Dyce v Lady James Hay (1852)]]. The law develops gradually by analogy with previous cases. For example, parking rights developed from [[easements]] of storage to easements in their own right, in recognition of their increasing importance.

However, a new type of easement must not be negative in nature. In [[Phipps v Pears [1965] 1 QB 76]] a claim for a new easement, a right to protection from the weather, was rejected. The court said that recognising new negative [[easements]] would unduly restrict the servient owner’s use and desirable development of their land.

The appropriate way to restrict development on sale of land would be to impose a covenant on the buyer.

## Disqualifying Factors

Once a right has satisfied the requirements of [[Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131]], then in principle it is capable of being an easement. However, there are three ‘disqualifying factors’ to consider. The presence of any one of these factors will prevent the right from being capable of being an easement.

The disqualifying factors have been refined over time, and the courts have found ways of mitigating the harshness of some of the tests, which means that rights cannot easily be defeated by a disqualifying factor.

The disqualifying factors are:

1. The exercise of the right must not amount to exclusive possession of the servient tenement.
2. The exercise of the right by the dominant owner must not involve additional, unavoidable expenditure by the servient owner.
3. The exercise of the right must not depend on permission being given by the servient owner.

### No Exclusive Possession

Easements are in essence limited rights to use the servient land. Of course, the existence of any easement interferes with the servient owner’s use of the servient land. For example, a right of way over land prevents the servient owner from using the land in such a way as to obstruct the exercise of the right.

If the exercise of the right amounts to exclusive possession by the dominant owner, the right cannot be an easement because the use by the dominant owner is too intense. An easement is an interest, not an estate in land. In that situation, the right could amount to a lease, or simply a personal licence to occupy.

> [!quote]
> "An easement must not amount to rights of occupation or… substantially deprive the owners of proprietorship of legal possession of the servient land."
> 
> Lord Evershed MR in [[Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131]]

There are two tests for what amounts to exclusive possession:

> [!test] Ouster principle test
> 
> The easement must not leave the servient owner with no reasonable use of the servient land ([[Batchelor v Marlow [2003] 1 WLR 764]]).

> [!test] Possession and control test
> The test in [[Moncrieff v Jamieson [2007] 1 WLR 2620]] asks whether the servient owner retains ultimate possession and control of the servient land, subject to the reasonable exercise of the right.

#### Reconciling Tests

In terms of precedent, the ouster principle (also known as the ‘reasonable use test’) is binding law. This was acknowledged in [[Kettel v Bloomfold Ltd [2012] EWHC 1422 (Ch)]]. [[Moncrieff v Jamieson [2007] 1 WLR 2620]] is a Scottish case which is persuasive authority only.

In that case, the court applied the Batchelor test, but in a ‘Moncrieff’ way. The claimant claimed a parking easement. It was held that the servient owner had not been deprived of reasonable use (the ‘ouster’ test) because he could still do anything he liked on the parking area except interfere with the parking (the ‘possession and control’ test).

The test seems to be changing slightly to favour the person claiming the easement, as the possession and control test makes it harder to defeat an easement on the basis if exclusive possession.

[[Virdi v Chana (2008)]] and [[Kettel v Bloomfold Ltd [2012] EWHC 1422 (Ch)]] indicate the willingness and, perhaps, the inventiveness of the court to circumvent the strictness of the [[Batchelor v Marlow [2003] 1 WLR 764]] reasonable use test. These show the inherent flexibility of the 'capable of grant' requirement from [[Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131]].

### No Additional Expenditure

If the exercise of a right by the dominant owner requires the servient tenement owner to spend extra money, the right is disqualified from being an easement, as a positive obligation is inconsistent with the concept of an easement.

A servient tenement owner is not obliged to carry out repairs or maintenance to enable the dominant owner to enjoy an easement. Instead, they must allow the dominant owner onto the servient land to carry out any repairs at the dominant owner’s expense: [[Jones v Pritchard [1908] 1 Ch 630]].

In [[Regis Property Co Ltd v Redman [1956] QB 612]] a right to supply of hot water was held not to be an easement as supplying hot water to the claimant meant that the servient owner was forced to spend money. Courts have found a claimant-friendly solution to this.

In [[Rance v Elvin (1985) 50 P&CR 9]] the court upheld an easement for a water supply even though the meter was on the servient land and the servient owner was solely responsible for the payment of bills. The court said the servient owner was obliged to allow the water through the pipes, and the dominant owner was liable in quasi-contract to pay his share of the bill.

### No Permission

Express permission will almost inevitably be given when a right is first used. However, after the initial grant, the dominant owner must exercise the benefit as of right. Enjoying the benefit as of right is the essence of an easement. If the dominant owner asks for permission every time the right is exercised, it cannot be an easement ([[Green v Ashco Horticultural Ltd [1966] 1 WLR 889]]).

What is the significance of the decision in [[Regency Villas Title Ltd v Diamond Resorts (Europe) Ltd [2018] UKSC 57]]?

1. Court recognised for the first time that purely recreational and sporting rights can amount to valid [[easements]], expanding dramatically the [[Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131]] approach.
2. The decision is important for the acceptance by the majority that the law should move with the times and recognise increasing social awareness of the value and importance of sporting activity

So there are lots of questions about how far this principle can go, and whether it will be taken up by the courts and applied outside the timeshare context. Does Regency Villas signal a shift towards a more flexible and enthusiastic judicial activism in land law?

The context of the case is crucial: in Re Ellenborough Park, the easement arose in an exclusively residential context. Regency Villas, by contrast, sees an easement of purely recreational rights arise in a context which is mixed in nature: both residential (timeshare development), but also commercial (the wider leisure complex development). This is important because it broadens enormously the potential scope of the Regency Villas decision and takes it some way from the narrow, communal 'pleasure ground' easement of a park garden.

Yet the decision extends the scope of easements seemingly even further in its discussion of ouster and positive obligations owed by servient landowners. The majority held that there was 'nothing inherently incompatible' with the recognition of rights over land where the parties share an expectation that the servient landowner will undertake management, maintenance and repair of any structures, fittings or even chattels thereon. There was no difficulty, said the court, so long as there was no legal obligation of that kind owed to the dominant owner. This is a significant judicial sleight of hand, since the positive obligations of maintenance placed on the Park owners was vast. It appears that the court have abolished or at least engaged in a dramatic re-framing of the statement that rights imposing positive obligations cannot amount to easements.

N.B. facts of the case are very similar to those in *Copeland v Greenhalf (1952)*, where a wheelwright claimed to have acquired an easement by long user to park vehicles pending repair on a strip of land adjoining that of the claimant. The wheelwright had made use of the strip of land for over 50 years and on a regular basis. The right here was held to not be capable of existing as an easement, on the grounds that it goes wholly outside any normal idea of an easement. It is virtually a claim to possession of the servient tenement. Could distinguish that here the owner could park lorries, and do repairs on those vehicles while parked on the strip. By contrast, here the right is only to park. In *Hair v Gillman (2000)*, a right to park a car anywhere on a ‘forecourt capable of taking two or three cars’ did constitute an easement. 

Then *Batchelor v Marlow (2003)*: a right to park between 8.30am and 6pm Mon-Fri on adjoining land was not capable of being an easement because the servient owner’s right to use the land was curtailed altogether for intermittent periods throughout the week. This made ownership of the land illusory.

But Lord Scott rejected this in *Moncrieff*, using the argument that if an easement created by grant could be acquired by prescription, why could an owner of a 9-space car park grant an easement to park 9 cars on the land. Argued that the question should instead be whether a servient owner retains possession and, subject to the reasonable exercise of the right in question, control of the land.  

Lord Neuberger admitted to seeing considerable force in the argument. But for now, the Batchelor authority remains untouched.

In [[Virdi v Chana (2008)]], a right to park a car in a single space was capable of constituting an easement, notwithstanding that the servient owner could clearly not park in it while it was being used by the dominant landowner. The court held that the servient owner retained reasonable use of the land as it was able to select the surface material from which the car parking space was constructed and was able to choose the planting arrangements around the space.

In [[Kettel v Bloomfold Ltd [2012] EWHC 1422 (Ch)]] the ccourt noted that a right to parking did not deprive the servient owner of reasonable use of the land as that owner retained the right to use the space beneath the car parking for pipelines and the airspace above, as well as the space itself when not in use by the dominant landowner. This indicates the inherent flexibility in the fourth 'capable of grant' requirement from Re Ellenborough Park.

The Law Commission in 2011 argued that Batchelor should be reversed by statute.

Xu argues that in effect the courts have already abolished the ouster principle in relation to car parking, but that its retention can serve a purpose in affording the courts discretion in non-parking cases. Says that the wholesale abolition of the ouster principle in all contexts seems unnecessary, excessive and potentially damaging to too much of the established property laws.
