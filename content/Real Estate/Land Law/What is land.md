# What is land

## Statutory Definition

> [!defn]
> “Land” includes land of any tenure, and mines and minerals, whether or not held apart from the surface, buildings or parts of buildings (whether the division is horizontal, vertical or made in any other way) and other corporeal hereditaments; also a manor, an advowson, and a rent and other incorporeal hereditaments, and an easement, right, privilege, or benefit in, over, or derived from land; . . . and “mines and minerals” include any strata or seam of minerals or substances in or under any land, and powers of working and getting the same . . .; and “manor” includes a lordship, and reputed manor or lordship; and “hereditament” means any real property which on an intestacy occurring before the commencement of this Act might have devolved upon an heir;
> ([s 205(1)(ix) LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/205))

There is a much higher degree of formality required to transfer land compared to other forms of property. A deed must be used to transfer land. A buyer of a piece of land will want to know what is included. A buyer of land gets everything that falls within the legal definition of land ([s 62 LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/62)).

- ‘Corporeal hereditaments’ means physical things attached to the land – called ‘[[fixtures]]’ in practice.
- ‘Incorporeal hereditaments’ are the benefit of any proprietary rights that the land has, but which have no physical substance. For example, if a piece of land has the benefit of an easement to park on the adjoining neighbour's land, this proprietary right is part of the land, and the benefit of it therefore passes with the land when it is sold.

## Airspace and Ground Below the Earth

> “cuius est solum eius est usque coelom et ad inferos maxim”.

The Latin maxim means he who owns the land owns everything up to the heavens above and the depths below.

Although rhetorically appealing, the maxim does not really represent the true state of the law. The depth and height of an estate owner’s land is limited to what they might, from a practical and policy perspective, reasonably require in order to make effective use of their possession.

See also, [[Trespass to land]].

### Airspace

An owner’s rights in the airspace above his land are restricted to such height as is necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of the land and the structures upon it.

Something on your neighbour’s land that overhangs yours is likely to be a trespass as they are, by definition, using space that you could utilise. Conversely, above that height, the owner has no greater rights than any other member of the public: [[Lord Bernstein v Skyviews and General Ltd [1978] QB 479]]

The law makes a distinction between the upper airspace and the lower airspace – that portion of airspace which is necessary for the landowner’s ordinary use and enjoyment. There is no exact height from where the upper airspace begins. The lower airspace is to such height as is necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the particular piece of land.

#### Upper Airspace

The [s 76(1) Civil Aviation Act 1982](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1982/16/section/76) grants immunity from trespass or nuisance for any innocent flight of aircraft.

#### Lower Airspace

If a structure overhangs your property so that it is in the ‘lower airspace’, that is a trespass irrespective of whether damage is caused to your property.

This can be illustrated in the case of [[Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co [1957] 2 Q.B. 334]] where an [[injunction]] was granted for the removal of an advertising sign erected by the defendant projected into the airspace above the plaintiff’s shop by a few inches.

In [[Anchor Brewhouse Developments v Berkley House (Docklands) Developments [1987] EGLR 172]] the jib of a crane trespassed in the airspace above the claimant's property and an injunction was granted.

**Note:** an [[injunction]] is a discretionary remedy, and the court may sometimes award damages if it considers damages are adequate in the circumstances.

See also: [[Laiqat v Majid [2005] EWHC 1305 (QB)]].

### Ground Below

This issue of who owns the ground beneath the surface of the earth came before the court in the case of [[Grigsby v Melville [1974] 1 WLR 80]].

#### **Exceptions**

There are some exceptions to the principle that a landowner owns everything beneath the surface of its land:

- A landowner is not entitled to all minerals under his land. All mines of gold and silver belong to the Crown.
- If a landowner finds “treasure” (as defined under the [Treasure Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/24/contents)) then that also belongs to the Crown.
- Any coal under land belongs to the Coal Authority by virtue of the [Coal Act 1938](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/1-2/52/enacted).
- [s 43 Infrastructure Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/7/section/43/enacted) effectively states there is no trespass at depths below 300 metres and therefore there is no need for the consent of the freehold owner to deep-level drilling.
