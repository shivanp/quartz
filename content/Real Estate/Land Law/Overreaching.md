# Overreaching

## Overreaching

Where land is subject to a trust, legal title is split: the legal owner or trustee holds the legal title, and the beneficiary or beneficiaries hold the equitable title.

### Context

When trust property is sold or mortgaged, it is important to strike a balance between on the one hand making sure that the buyer or lender is not bound by pre-existing trust interests; and on the other hand protecting the beneficiary’s position. If trustees sell or mortgage land, the buyer or lender will wish to make sure that they are not bound by pre-existing interests held by beneficiaries. In other words, they do not want to step into the shoes of the trustees. A buyer will probably want to occupy the property, and will want to ensure that there are no beneficiaries with prior rights preventing him from doing so. A lender will want to make sure that it is not bound by any pre-existing trust interests, as that could mean that the lender would be prevented from enforcing its mortgage by repossessing and selling the property.

On the other hand, the beneficiaries will want to make sure that their interests are protected as far as possible. The concept of overreaching was devised to solve this mess of competing rights and interests. Overreaching is governed by [LPA 1925, s 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/2) and [s 27](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/27) and applies equally to registered and unregistered land.

### Set-up

Overreaching applies to beneficiaries’ interests in trusts of land and to no other interest. In order to take the land free of the interests, a purchaser (which may be a buyer or a lender) must make sure that the capital money (which is the purchase price or the mortgage advance) is paid to at least two trustees. The money must not be paid direct to the beneficiaries, unless they are also trustees.

Broadly, if the buyer or lender pays purchase money or loan money to two legal owners/trustees, overreaching operates to detach the beneficiary’s equitable interest from the land, so the land is no longer encumbered by the interest.

Instead, the beneficiary’s interest is transferred into the money, which might be purchase money paid by a buyer, or mortgage money advanced by a lender. This achieves the balance of interests as far as possible: the buyer or lender holds the property free from any interest held by the beneficiary, as the beneficiary’s interest has moved away from the land. And the beneficiary still has an interest under a trust, but now it is an interest in money.

What this means is that if a beneficiary has a 25% beneficial interest in land, and the interest is overreached on sale, the beneficiary from then on has a 25% beneficial interest in the proceeds of the sale. The trustees may distribute the money or, depending on the terms of the trust, may reinvest it elsewhere.

If the money is paid to only one trustee, a beneficiary’s interest will not be overreached and will remain in the land. The interests will bind a purchaser as overriding interests under [LRA Sched 3 para 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/schedule/3/paragraph/2) if the beneficiary is in actual occupation of the trust land.

Consider [[City of London Building Society v Flegg]] and [[Williams & Glyn’s bank v Boland [1981] AC 487]].

Overreaching is not a creation of LRA 2002 nor LPA 1925. Describes the process under which particular equitable [[interests in land]] that might otherwise potentially bind a purchaser of that land are detached from the land and translated into the proceeds of sale. This operates when there is a conveyance of land and serves to substitute for money certain equitable interests affecting that land.

It is a 'defence mechanism' facilitating conveyancing, assisting purchasers and ensuring efficient dealings with land. Overreaching touches on a wider debate encircling land law: the tension between a view of land as 'static security' and as 'dynamic security'. Static security protects the rights of existing owners at the expense, if necessary, of purchasers. Dynamic security is provided by legal rules that protect the reasonable expectations of those who purchase in good faith. This lowers transaction costs by limiting the inquiries that purchasers need to make. Dynamic security is favoured in law of Western countries because of its greater economic importance.

Overreaching can take place without the consent of the interest holder. For overreaching to occur:

1. There must be an equitable interest capable of being overreached
	- s 2 LPA 1925 sets out which interests can be overreached and which are excluded
		- An equitable lease, equitable easement or estate contract can never be overreached.
	- Overreaching applied principally to equitable interests under a trust
	- For interests that cannot be overreached, their priority is determined by applying the usual rules on priority under ss 28 and 29.
2. The statutory conditions for overreaching must be met (ss 2 and 27 LPA 1925).
	- s 2(1) LPA: there must be 'a conveyance to a purchaser of a legal estate in land'.
		- s 205(1)(ii) defines a conveyance as including "a mortgage, charge, lease…"
		- Legal estate includes both freehold and leasehold land.
	- Purchase/mortgage monies must be paid to at least two trustees or a trust corporation (s 27 LPA).

In a family home context, those enjoying equitable interests under a trust of land will often also be holders of the legal title. So if the land is sold (for which all legal co-owners must consent), overreaching will take place without any difficulty. Problems arise when those holding legal title are different to those with beneficial interests in the land under trust.

Considering [[City of London Building Society v Flegg]], it is often said that the protection of overreaching for beneficiaries can be illusory, and results can be harsh and unjust.

In [[Baker v Craggs [2018] EWCA Civ 1126]] the Court of Appeal confirmed that the grant of an easement did not satisfy the requirement, under s 2 LPA 1925, for a 'conveyance of a legal estate in land', for the purposes of overreaching. While an easement was a legal estate, it was not a 'conveyance of a legal estate in land' for the purposes of s 2 LPA 1925, because under s 1 LPA 1925 the only estates capable of subsisting or being conveyed at law were freehold and leasehold estates.

Other points:

- Where purchase/mortgage monies are paid to just a single trustee, overreaching will not take place ([[Williams & Glyn’s bank v Boland [1981] AC 487]]).
- Where there is fraud, overreaching cannot take place ([[HSBC v Dyche [2009] EWHC 2954]])
- Where no capital monies are raised on the conveyance (e.g., mortgage to discharge debt or secure future debt), there is no requirement for payment to two or more trustees (s 27 LPA 1925) for overreaching to operate: [[State Bank of India v Sood [1997] Ch. 276]].
- In [[Mortgage Express v Lambert [2016] EWCA Civ 555]] CA held that a mere equity arising from an unconscionable bargain amounted to a proprietary right (s 116 LRA 2002) and this is a right capable of being overreached.

If the conditions for overreaching are not met, overreaching cannot operate and the equitable interest will remain attached to the land. Consider the following scenarios:

| Scenario                                                                                   | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Overreaching has not taken place and the third party acquiring the land is a purchaser     | If a purchaser registers her title and overreaching has not taken place, under s 29 LRA 2002 the purchaser will take the land free of pre-existing, non-overreached equitable interests that are not otherwise protected on the register under s 29 LRA 2002. |
| Overreaching has not taken place and the third party acquiring the land is a non-purchaser | If a non-purchaser acquires the land, they will be bound by the pre-existing but non-overreached interest (s 28 LRA; basic priority rule).                                                                                                                    |
| Overreaching has not taken place yet an overriding interest can be established.            | If the non-overreached interest amounts to an overriding interest under Sch 3 LRA 2002, that equitable interest will still bind the purchaser of the land under s 29 LRA 2002.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
