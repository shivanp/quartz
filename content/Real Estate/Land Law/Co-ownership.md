# Co-ownership

![[Co-Ownership_1.jpg]]

## Introduction

Concurrent co-ownership arises where two or more people together own the same estate in the same piece of land at the same time. Where a couple buys a house together, both people share the ownership of the freehold and are said to own the freehold concurrently.

Prior to 1925, concurrent co-ownership was relatively uncommon. Most families lived in residential accommodation held on short-term tenancies; and if the family home was owned outright, it would generally be owned by the husband or father.

With increased prosperity throughout the 20th century, and as the status of women changed, it was increasingly common for husbands and wives to own their homes jointly. Today, development has continued, with unmarried and same-sex couples jointly purchasing their own homes.

Co-ownership is all about the legal relationship between co-owners of land.

### Imposition of a Trust

Today, whenever land is owned jointly, a trust of land is imposed. This has the effect of separating the legal title to the land, which is held by trustees, from the equitable title, which is held by the beneficiaries.

Ownership of the legal title does not confer any rights of enjoyment over the land. Instead, it carries with it powers and duties of management. The people who benefit from the trust are the beneficiaries.

It is important to understand the historical reasons for imposing a trust, as it explains the rationale behind today’s law.

The distinction between legal and equitable title can be summarised as follows:

| Legal title                          | Equitable title                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Held by trustees                     | Held by beneficiaries                                                                          |
| Owner(s) registered at Land Registry | Names kept private and arrangements relating to equitable title do not appear on the registers |
| Powers and duties of management      | Enjoyment over the land.                                                                                               |

### Historical Background

Historically, under[Law of Property Act 1925, s 34(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/34) and [s 36](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/36), the trust which was automatically imposed when property was jointly owned was a trust for sale. The purpose of this was to reflect attitudes to land ownership. Land was a commodity to be invested in, in the same way as happened with wheat, oil, and coal. Ownership was designed to provide an income for the family. If a better investment became available, it was imperative that the existing investment in land could be readily sold and the proceeds invested elsewhere. To enable this to happen, land was transferred to trustees who had a primary duty to sell the land, and reinvest the proceeds, although they did have a power to postpone sale.

As attitudes towards land ownership changed, and property was bought as a long-term home rather than a short-term investment, trustees inevitably exercised their power to postpone sale more and more often, and for an indefinite period. This meant that the law was out of step with society’s attitudes which viewed land, and particularly the home, as an asset to keep. The [Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/contents) came into effect on 1 January 1997 and reformed the law. Under [s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/1), all previous trusts for sale and all future trusts involving land are trusts of land; and the statute governs the rights and duties of trustees, the rights of beneficiaries, and the resolution of disputes.

## Types of Trust

### Express Trust

Where a trust is expressly created, there are formalities which must be followed by the person who sets up the trust:

[LPA 1925, s 53(1)(b)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/53):

> ‘a declaration of trust respecting any land or interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person who is able to declare such trust or by his will.’

These formalities, which require the declaration of trust to be evidenced in signed writing, apply in the following situations:

- Where the trust is deliberately set up, either during the owner’s lifetime or in his will.
- Where land is gifted to a minor. Here, there must be a trust as minors cannot own property in their own right: [LPA 1925, s 1(6)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1). It is therefore necessary to transfer the land to a trustee to hold it for the beneficiary.
- Where land is bought by more than one person in joint names.

### Implied Trust

Trusts may arise informally, without any writing at all. There are no formalities for the creation of such trusts.

[LPA 1925, s 53(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/53):

> ‘this section [which sets out the formalities for creating an express trust] does not affect the creation or operation of resulting, implied or constructive trusts.’

Implied trusts may arise:

- If a property is bought in A’s name, but B makes a financial contribution. A trust will be implied in favour of B to reflect B’s contribution, by way of resulting trust. So if B paid 25% of the price, A will hold the property on trust for A and B in a 75%:25% ratio. (In the context of the family home, a resulting trust no longer has any place, and a common intention constructive trust will be used instead.
- Constructive trusts arise in a wider range of circumstances, but all respond to unconscionability. They will therefore be imposed in cases where it is unconscionable for the legal owner of the land to deny the interest of another person.

```ad-example
title: Express trust
A grandfather made a Will in which he left his house on trust for this six grandchildren in equal shares. He appointed A and B as trustees.

After the grandfather’s death, the executors of his estate transferred the legal title of the house to A and B. As the Will set out the declaration of trust in writing which was signed (LPA 1925, s 53(1)(b)), the trust is properly declared in favour of the grandchildren. They hold the equitable interest.

The trustees have the power to sell the house, but they cannot keep the proceeds: they are bound as trustees to account to the beneficiaries or reinvest for them.
```

```ad-example
title: Express trust
A brother and sister, X and Y, bought a home together. X paid 75% of the price and Y paid 25%.

The transfer deed transferred the legal title to them both. In the transfer deed X and Y made an express declaration that they hold the property for themselves beneficially in proportion to their contributions (75% for X and 25% for Y.)

Here, X and Y hold both the legal and equitable title. The flexible rules relating to the equitable title enable them to reflect their individual contributions.
```

```ad-example
title: Implied trust

V and W decided to buy a home together. Although they both contributed to the purchase price, the property was transferred to V as sole legal owner.

As the property was bought as a family home, and W paid part of the price, they may be able to establish an interest under a common intention constructive trust. No formalities are required for this to happen: LPA 1925, s 53(2). V will hold the property as trustee for V and W in shares quantified by the court.

If the property is mortgaged or sold, V as trustee will be the person who has the power to execute the mortgage or transfer deed.
```

## Legal and Equitable Titles

### Background

Whenever land is co-owned, a trust of land is automatically imposed (Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996) which involves the separation of the legal and equitable titles.

In cases of joint title, the joint owners are trustees and both are registered at the Land Registry as the legal owners. The joint owners are also the beneficiaries, who hold the property on trust for themselves in equity.

This may seem a strange way of dealing with co-ownership, but it is actually very efficient. The rules for holding the legal title are kept as simple as possible to make it easy to buy, sell and mortgage land. For example, there is a limit on the number of trustees who can hold the legal title. This means that a buyer or lender only has a limited number of people to deal with, making the process quicker and easier.

### Types of Co-ownership

A preliminary issue to consider is the nature of the co-ownership relationship between the co-owning parties, and how this relates to legal and equitable titles.

A common feature of co-owned land is that all co-owners are simultaneously entitled to possession of it. No co-owner is entitled to exclusive possession of any part. This is known as **unity of possession,** and this is what distinguishes co-ownership from sole ownership. Both the joint tenancy and the tenancy in common share the common characteristic of unity of possession: without it there simply is no co-ownership.

There are two types of co-ownership: the joint tenancy and the tenancy in common.

#### Joint Tenancy

Where there is a joint tenancy, all co-owners are deemed to constitute one single entity, and own the whole property as one collective entity.

As joint tenants are viewed as a single entity, they must hold the four unities: [[A G Securities v Vaughan [1990] 1 AC 417]].

#### Tenancy in Common

A tenancy in common requires only unity of possession, although the other unities may be present.

This is because tenants in common are not viewed as a single entity, but as each having a ‘distinct but undivided share’ in the land. Each has a clearly quantified share of the whole, say 25%, but cannot point to any particular part of the land and say ‘that is my 25%’. If they could, that would mean that there was no unity of possession!

#### The Four Unities

| Unity               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unity of possession | Each co-owner is as much entitled to possession of any part of the land as the others. No co-owner can be excluded from any part of the land.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Unity of interest   | The interest in land held by each co-owner must be of the same nature and duration. For example, in a leasehold context, all owners must hold the lease for the same length of time, with joint obligations. In a freehold context, the owners must hold the same freehold interest, such as a legal fee simple or an equitable freehold. |
| Unity of title      | All co-owners must acquire their title from the same document. This will be satisfied if they all obtain title from the same transfer deed or lease.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Unity of time       | The interest of each co-owner must vest at the same time. This does not mean that they must all sign the document at the same time, or move into the property at the same time. To have unity of time, the interest of each co-owner must take effect at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### Survivorship

The practical significance of holding land as a joint tenant or as a tenant in common arises when one co-owner dies. Joint tenants are regarded as a single entity, and therefore when one joint tenant dies, survivorship *orius acccrescendi* (literally: right of survivorship) applies.

This means that the notional interest of the deceased joint tenant accrues to the surviving joint tenants. It is incorrect to say that the deceased joint tenant’s ‘share’ goes to the surviving joint tenants, as of course a joint tenant does not have a ‘share’ in the first place.

```ad-note
The right of survivorship will only apply to co-owners holding the land as joint tenants.
```

Survivorship operates automatically as soon as the joint tenant dies. This means that the interest accrues immediately on death and is unaffected by any provision in a will, or by the intestacy rules if there is no will. This is because a will is of no effect until after death, by which time the survivorship has already operated. Therefore, any provision in a will which purports to leave a joint tenant’s interest to someone will have no effect: [[Re Caines deceased [1978] 1 WLR 540]].

When there are two joint tenants, on the death of one, the interest accrues to the survivor who becomes sole owner.

Survivorship does not apply to an interest held by a tenant in common, which will pass in accordance with the deceased’s will, or under the intestacy rules if there is no will.

| Joint tenancy                    | Tenancy in common                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Single entity                    | Each person has own share                   |
| No shares: composite ownership   | Individual but 'undivided' shares           |
| Level of contribution irrelevant | Shares can be proportionate to contribution |
| Must have 4 unities              | Must have unity of possession               |
| Survivorship applies             | No survivorship: shares passes with will                                            |

#### Legal Title

The legal title is the ‘public’ face of co-ownership: the trustees are named as registered proprietors on the proprietorship register at the Land Registry and are the people who deal with buyers and lenders.

To keep the title as simple as possible, the following rules apply:

- There must be a maximum of four legal owners: [Trustee Act 1925, s 34(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/34).
- The trustees must be ‘sui juris’: of full age and sound mind: [LPA 1925, s 1(6)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1) and [s 22](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/22).
- If land is transferred to more than four people, the first four named who are sui juris will be the legal titleholders: [LPA 1925, s 34(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1).

The legal titleholders must hold the property as joint tenants, meaning that they have the four unities, are a single entity, and collectively hold the whole legal estate. Nobody has a separate interest. Thus, on the death of any legal joint tenant, the right of survivorship operates, and the interest accrues to the surviving joint tenants.

The legal joint tenancy cannot be severed to make a tenancy in common: [LPA 1925, s 36(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/36). This avoids the complications which would arise if the legal owners could leave their separate share to their heirs, because on the death of a joint tenant the number of legal owners will reduce rather than increase.

#### Equitable Title

The equitable title is the ‘private’ face of co-ownership: the names of the equitable owners do not appear on the registers of title, and the way the equitable interests are held is not disclosed. The equitable title is much more flexible and can be constructed to reflect the wishes of the owners.

There is no limit on the number of people who can hold an equitable interest in a piece of land; nor is there any requirement that they be sui juris. Property is often held on trust for under-18s, for example. The equitable owners can choose whether they hold the equitable title as joint tenants or tenants in common, although they must of course hold the four unities to be joint tenants.

If they hold as tenants in common, each owner will have what is called a ‘distinct but undivided’ share in the property. That means that if a tenant in common holds a 25% share of the equitable interest, that person cannot point to any particular area of the property and say ‘that is my 25%’; instead they will have a 25% of the whole.

An equitable joint tenancy can be severed by any joint tenant so that that person in future holds a separate share as a tenant in common.

##### Characterisation

The equitable title can be held as a joint tenancy if the four unities are present. If they are not, then there will be a tenancy in common as long as unity of possession exists.

It is possible, and good practice, for the parties to make an express declaration that they hold the beneficial interest as joint tenants. These words will be found in the will or transfer deed. It is important to remember that an express declaration by itself will not be enough: the four unities must also be present.

The equitable title will be held as a tenancy in common if unity of time, title or interest is missing.

Even if the four unities are present, an express declaration that the owners hold as tenants in common will prevail: [[Pink v Lawrence [1978] 36 P&CR]]. Falling short of an express declaration, words such as ‘in equal shares’ or ‘equally’ may be present, which indicate that the parties intend to have ‘shares’.

Where there is no specific wording, a rebuttable presumption of a tenancy in common will arise where:

- land is a business asset ([[Lake v Craddock (1732) 3 P Wms 158]]); and
- the purchase price of a non-domestic property has been paid in unequal shares ([[Bull v Bull [1955] 1 QB 234]]).

```ad-summary
Legal Title
- Maximum of 4 Trustees (i.e. 4 legal owners registered at the Land Registry)
- All must be ‘sui juris’ (+18 and of sound mind)
- Must hold as joint tenants. This means the 4 unities must be present and the right of survivorship applies.
- The joint tenancy cannot be severed into a tenancy in common

Equitable Title
- Unlimited number can hold
- Can be held by U18’s and those that lack mental capacity
- Can be held as joint tenancy or tenancy in common
- Equitable joint tenancy can be severed into tenancy in common
- Survivorship also applies to equitable joint tenancy, but not to an equitable tenancy in common
```

## Rights and Duties of Trustees and Beneficiaries

All co-owned land is held under a trust of land.

The trust is governed by the [Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/contents) (TLATA 1996). The Act governs the way the trust of land operates and confers rights and powers on both trustees and beneficiaries, and sets out the duties of the trustees.

When looking at the provisions of **TLATA 1996** it must be remembered that the statute does not simply cover trusts which arise as a result of land being co-owned. Many of the provisions apply to trusts of land set up in wills, or express lifetime trusts created by a settlor.

### Powers and Duties of Trustees

The legal title to land is vested in the trustees who have the powers of an absolute owner: [TLATA 1996, s 6(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/6). This means that they can sell, mortgage, lease, grant easements and so on. However, the power is not absolute: the trustees have the powers of an absolute owner subject to the brakes imposed in the Act. [TLATA 1996, s 6(5)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/6) says that the trustees must have regard to the rights of the beneficiaries when exercising their powers, and act in accordance with the duty of care imposed in [TLATA 1996, s 6(9)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/6) and [Trustee Act 2000 s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/1).

One of the most important brakes on the trustee’s powers is contained in [TLATA 1996, s 11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/11). The trustees must, in the exercise of any function relating to the land, so far as practicable consult the beneficiaries of full age, and so far as is consistent with the general interest of the trust, give effect to the wishes of those beneficiaries or, in the case of a dispute, to the wishes of the majority by value of the combined interests.

This means that if the trustees wish to sell the property they are obliged to consult the beneficiaries, but need not give effect to their wishes unless it is deemed to be in the general interest of the trust.

```ad-statute
title: s 6 TLATA 1996
(1) For the purpose of exercising their functions as trustees, the trustees of land have in relation to the land subject to the trust all the powers of an absolute owner.

(2) Where in the case of any land subject to a trust of land each of the beneficiaries interested in the land is a person of full age and capacity who is absolutely entitled to the land, the powers conferred on the trustees by subsection (1) include the power to convey the land to the beneficiaries even though they have not required the trustees to do so; and where land is conveyed by virtue of this subsection—

- (a) the beneficiaries shall do whatever is necessary to secure that it vests in them, and

- (b) if they fail to do so, the court may make an order requiring them to do so.

(3) The trustees of land have power to acquire land under the power conferred by section 8 of the Trustee Act 2000.

(5) In exercising the powers conferred by this section trustees shall have regard to the rights of the beneficiaries.

(6) The powers conferred by this section shall not be exercised in contravention of, or of any order made in pursuance of, any other enactment or any rule of law or equity.

(7) The reference in subsection (6) to an order includes an order of any court or of the Charity Commission.

(8) Where any enactment other than this section confers on trustees authority to act subject to any restriction, limitation or condition, trustees of land may not exercise the powers conferred by this section to do any act which they are prevented from doing under the other enactment by reason of the restriction, limitation or condition.

(9) The duty of care under section 1 of the Trustee Act 2000 applies to trustees of land when exercising the powers conferred by this section.
```

```ad-summary
Trustees - hold legal title
- Have the powers of an absolute owner (s 6(1)) but must have regard to the rights of the beneficiaries (s 6(5))
- Duty of care imposed in s 6(9) and Trustee Act 2000 s 1
- Duty to consult beneficiaries of full age and give effect to the wishes of those beneficiaries or, in the case of a dispute, to the wishes of the majority by value of the combined interests.
```

### Rights of Beneficiaries

Before TLATA 1996 was enacted, beneficiaries’ interests were regarded as being in the proceeds of sale of land and not in land itself. This is known as the doctrine of conversion, whereby the interests were seen as being personal interests in money even though there had been no sale!

[TLATA 1996, s 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/3) abolished the doctrine of conversion and beneficiaries now enjoy proprietary interests in the land itself. They have two main rights: the right to be consulted and the right to occupy trust land, but these rights are hedged and bound by qualifications.

As has been seen, the trustees hold the land for the beneficiaries and the trustees’ powers are to be exercised in their best interests. The trustees owe the beneficiaries a duty of care: [TLATA 1996, s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/1), and [s 6(5)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/6) obliges the trustees to have regard to the rights of the beneficiaries when exercising their powers. They must also, in the exercise of any function, consult the beneficiaries, but need not give effect to their wishes unless it is deemed to be in the general interest of the trust: [TLATA 1996, s 11](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/11).

The right to be consulted is very important if the beneficiaries’ views are to be heard, especially in trusts of land where equitable owners are not also legal owners. However, as stated above, the trustees are not obliged to act on their wishes.

#### Right to Occupy

Beneficiaries have a right to occupy trust property: [TLATA 1996, s 12](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/12). The right will only arise where two criteria are met:

1. It must be shown that the land was intended for occupation by those beneficiaries: TLATA 1996, s 12(1).
2. It must be shown that the land is suitable for occupation by the particular beneficiaries: TLATA 1996, s 12(2).

```ad-statute
title: s 12 TLATA 1996

(1) A beneficiary who is beneficially entitled to an interest in possession in land subject to a trust of land is entitled by reason of his interest to occupy the land at any time if at that time—

- (a) the purposes of the trust include making the land available for his occupation (or for the occupation of beneficiaries of a class of which he is a member or of beneficiaries in general), or

- (b) the land is held by the trustees so as to be so available.

(2) Subsection (1) does not confer on a beneficiary a right to occupy land if it is either unavailable or unsuitable for occupation by him.

(3) This section is subject to section 13.
```

It is clear from above that where a couple owns a home jointly, each will have the right to occupy it, as the property is both intended and suitable for occupation by them.

However, if the land was bought as an investment, say as a buy-to-let property, then there may be no right to occupy, as it was not intended for occupation by beneficiaries.

Note that TLATA 1996, s 12(2) states that there is no right to occupy if the land is unsuitable for occupation by a beneficiary. The land does not have to be unsuitable for occupation altogether, it must simply be unsuitable for occupation by that particular beneficiary. For example, land which is a farm may not be suitable for occupation by a beneficiary who is not a farmer.

#### Restrictions

If two or more beneficiaries have a right to occupy the same land, the trustees can exclude or restrict the right for one or more, but not all, of them: [TLATA 1996, s 13(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/13); although they may not unreasonably exclude any beneficiary, or restrict to an unreasonable extent: [TLATA 1996, s 13(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/13).

In exercising the power to exclude or restrict, the trustees must have regard to the purpose for which the land was bought, and the circumstances and wishes of each beneficiary who is entitled to occupy: [TLATA 1996, s 13(4)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/13).

The trustees may impose conditions such as paying outgoings and expenses, on beneficiaries in occupation: TLATA 1996, s 13(3) ands 13(6). If a beneficiary has been excluded, the trustees may require the occupying beneficiaries to pay compensation to him/them: TLATA 1996, s 13(6).

If a beneficiary is already in occupation of the land, the trustees cannot exercise their powers so as to exclude that person, nor in a manner likely to make the beneficiary leave, unless the beneficiary consents or the court approves.

These provisions weaken the apparently strong right to occupy considerably.

```ad-summary
Beneficiaries - hold Equitable title
- Right to be consulted if 18+ (s 11)
- Right to occupy the land (s 12) if the land was intended for and is suitable for occupation, but can be restricted if two or more beneficiaries have the right to occupy (s 13). Conditions can also be imposed, such as paying outgoings.
```

## Dispute Resolution

By its very nature, co-ownership involves two or more people owning the same land at the same time. It is inevitable that there will be differences of opinion affecting ownership, particularly as to whether the land should be sold or not.

Where the trustees and the beneficiaries are different people, and the land is owned as a commercial venture or as an investment, any difference of opinion may be dealt with by the trustees using their discretion.

However, where the property has been purchased as a home, and the trustees and the beneficiaries being the same people whose relationship has ended, the chances of any dispute being resolved amicably are much reduced. Further, if one or more co-owners is in debt, the creditors may wish to press for a sale of the property in order to recover the money due to them, although the co-owners may not want this.

### TLATA 1996

Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 (TLATA 1996) does not simply govern the way the trust of land operates. It also contains provisions as to how disputes relating to land held in trust are to be resolved.

[TLATA 1996, s 14](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/14) gives courts jurisdiction to hear applications regarding disputes which involve co-owned land. Anyone with an interest in the land can apply to the court for an order relating to it.

```ad-statute
title: s 14 TLATA 1996
(1) Any person who is a trustee of land or has an interest in property subject to a trust of land may make an application to the court for an order under this section.

(2) On an application for an order under this section the court may make any such order—
- (a) relating to the exercise by the trustees of any of their functions (including an order relieving them of any obligation to obtain the consent of, or to consult, any person in connection with the exercise of any of their functions), or
- (b) declaring the nature or extent of a person’s interest in property subject to the trust,
as the court thinks fit.

(3) The court may not under this section make any order as to the appointment or removal of trustees.

(4) The powers conferred on the court by this section are exercisable on an application whether it is made before or after the commencement of this Act.
```

- Applicants could be trustees; beneficiaries; mortgagees of the legal or equitable title; trustees in bankruptcy; people who hold charging orders etc.
- The court may order trustees to do something eg: sell; or allow a beneficiary into occupation. It cannot order one beneficiary to ‘buy out’ the another
- Orders which may be made include orders for sale (which may be postponed); orders as to who occupies; and orders as to the nature or extent of a beneficiary’s interest.

### Court Decision-making

The court must apply all factors in [s 15 TLATA 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/15) in reaching its decision in relation to s 14 applications. It cannot pick and choose which factors to apply: all relevant factors must be considered equally. Each must be considered carefully and a decision made as to whether it leans towards granting an application for, say, an order for sale, or against it.

```ad-statute
title: s 15 TLATA 1996
(1) The matters to which the court is to have regard in determining an application for an order under section 14 include—
- (a) the intentions of the person or persons (if any) who created the trust,
- (b) the purposes for which the property subject to the trust is held,
- (c) the welfare of any minor who occupies or might reasonably be expected to occupy any land subject to the trust as his home, and
- (d) the interests of any secured creditor of any beneficiary.

(2) In the case of an application relating to the exercise in relation to any land of the powers conferred on the trustees by section 13, the matters to which the court is to have regard also include the circumstances and wishes of each of the beneficiaries who is (or apart from any previous exercise by the trustees of those powers would be) entitled to occupy the land under section 12.

(3) In the case of any other application, other than one relating to the exercise of the power mentioned in section 6(2), the matters to which the court is to have regard also include the circumstances and wishes of any beneficiaries of full age and entitled to an interest in possession in property subject to the trust or (in case of dispute) of the majority (according to the value of their combined interests).

(4) This section does not apply to an application if section 335A of the M1Insolvency Act 1986 (which is inserted by Schedule 3 and relates to applications by a trustee of a bankrupt) applies to it.

When we are considering co-owned land, we need not be concerned with the factor in **TLATA 1996, s 15(a)** as this relates to expressly created lifetime trusts, or will trusts, and not to everyday co-ownership. It is where someone sits down to bequeath their assets through a trust to create wealth for their family. TLATA 1996, s 15(b) requires the court to consider: "the purposes for which the property subject to the trust is held".

If that purpose is still continuing, it will weigh against an order for sale being made. The contrasting cases [[In re Ever’s Trust [1980] 1 WLR 1327]] and [[Jones v Challenger [1961] 1 QB 176]] illustrate this.

```ad-note
These cases were decided under a different statutory regime, before TLATA 1996 came into force, but there is no reason to think that, were they to be decided today, the outcome would be any different.
```

#### S 15(c)

TLATA 1996, s 15(c) requires the court to consider ‘the welfare of any minor who occupies or might reasonably be expected to occupy any land subject to the trust as his home’. This factor is heavily dependent on circumstances. Children aged six and seven may well have great weight attached to their welfare, with the continuity of their living arrangements being given priority over the interests of the applicant who wants a sale. On the other hand, a young person who is seventeen and still a child for these purposes, but may well be at work, and relatively independent. In that case, less weight will be given to their interests.

#### S 15(d)

TLATA 1996, s 15(d) requires the court to consider ‘the interests of any secured creditor of any beneficiary’.

The approach of the court to the interests of the creditor has changed over time. Pre-TLATA 1996, the presumption was always in favour of a sale, and the interests of the creditors tended to take precedence even where there were children in the property and the purpose for which the property was bought continued. Post-TLATA 1996 the interests of the secured creditors are just one factor to be considered. There is no presumption for or against a sale at the start. The new approach is illustrated by [[Mortgage Corporation v Shaire [2001] Ch 743]].

| [[Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages v Bell [2001] 2 FLR 809]] | The Court of Appeal ordered a sale. The purpose of a family home, and the interests of a minor were not material factors, as Mr and Mrs Bell had divorced and their son was almost 18. The bank was owed £300,000 and no payment had been made for almost eight years. The level of debt was rising daily. Without a sale the bank had no real prospect of recovering anything, which the court felt was very unfair to the bank in the circumstances. |
| [[C Putnam and Sons v Taylor [2009] EWCH 317 (Ch)]]          | The secured creditor of a husband was granted an order for sale of a jointly owned property when his debts became unmanageable. The purpose of a family home still continuing, but the court ordered the sale as the wife held enough equity in the property to enable her to buy a smaller property outright.                                                                                                                                         |
| [[Fred Perry v Genis [2015] 1 P&CR DG5]]                   | A sale was ordered even though the children’s education at a specialist school would be disrupted. The court specifically stated that commercial interests should take precedence over the residential security of the family. However it postponed the order for a year to give the family time to relocate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### S 15(3)

Finally, do not forget the general sweeper in s 15(3). The court must have regard to the wishes of the beneficiaries who are over 18. If there is a dispute, the court shall have regard to the majority (in respect of value of interest held.)

```ad-summary
**TLATA 1996 s 14** allows anyone with an interest in land to apply to the court for an order in relation to that land.

The usual form of order requested is an order for sale of the property, which can be postponed for a period of time.

In making its decision, the court must have regard to the criteria in **TLATA 1996, s 15.**

All criteria should be weighed even-handedly: the purpose for which the land was bought; the interests of minors; the interests of secured creditors; and the circumstances and wishes of beneficiaries of full age.

In practice, greater weight tends to be given to the interests of creditors, especially where the debt has spiralled out of control, or there is sufficient equity in the property to purchase an alternative.
