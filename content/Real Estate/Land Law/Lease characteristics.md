# Lease characteristics

## Characteristics of a Lease

If it is found that the characteristics of a lease are not present, looking at the transaction objectively, then the arrangement can only be a licence.

```ad-tip
title: Requirements
For a lease to exist, rather than a licence, there needs to be:
1. Certainty of term
2. Exclusive possession
3. The correct formalities used to create the lease
```

- Certainty of term means that the tenancy must be granted for a certain duration. This means you need to know when the arrangement will end.
	- If certainty of term is not present in the arrangement, no lease will be found.
	- In the case of [[Lace v Chantler [1944] KB 368]] a lease ‘for the duration of the war’ failed for lack of certainty.
	- The usual way of satisfying this requirement is a fixed term lease, e.g., five-year term.
- Exclusive possession means the right to exclude all others from the property, including the landlord.
- Formalities are the rules that must be followed to formalise the arrangement, i.e., the steps the parties need to take.
	- Given the proprietary status of a lease, there is a high degree of formality that the parties must adhere to in order to create the legal estate.

## Certainty of Term

This can be shown either with a fixed or periodic term.

- A **fixed term** exists where the maximum duration of the arrangement is known from the outset.
	- Once a fixed term lease is created, neither party can unilaterally bring the lease to an end earlier, unless there is a break clause
- A **periodic tenancy** is technically a lease for one period. This is generally weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly.
	- The tenancy extends itself automatically unless either the landlord or tenant give notice to terminate the tenancy.
	- An **express** periodic tenancy is where there is a written agreement documenting the agreement.
	- An **implied** periodic tenancy is where there is nothing set out in writing, but the certain term arises by looking objectively at all relevant circumstances including payment and acceptance of rent on a periodic basis.

```ad-example
Monthly payments of rent (without agreement on a fixed term from the outset) may create an implied monthly periodic tenancy.
```

See also [[Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body [1992] 2 A.C. 386]].

The 'term' of the periodic tenancy depends upon the period by reference to which the rent is calculated, rather than the intervals at which it is payable.

e.g., if the tenant agrees to pay £10,000 a year by four quarterly payments, the tenancy is a yearly tenancy not a quarterly tenancy, because the rent is calculated annually.

## Exclusive Possession

```ad-defn
Exclusive possession means the right to exclude all others from the property, including the landlord.
```

Demonstrating that exclusive possession has been granted is often difficult. Historically, tenants of residential leases were granted greater protection and landlords were keen to avoid granting leases. There are many cases where the court considered the nature of an arrangement, looking beyond the label given to the agreement by the parties (headline case: [[Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809]]).

```ad-info
Since the introduction of Assured Shorthold Tenancies (ASTs), the distinction between  a lease and licence is of far less importance in a residential context.
```

Whether exclusive possession exists is a question of fact in each case: the substance of the agreement has to be examined. The courts will look at the reality of a situation. So even if a clause appears to defeat exclusion possession but has been inserted into a lease only to make what would otherwise be a lease appear like a licence, it will be thrown out as a sham.

N.B. do not confuse exclusive possession with exclusive occupation.

Several scenarios are examined.

### Retention of a Key

The fact that a landlord retains a key to the premises may make it appear as if the occupant does not have exclusive possession. However, it is the **purpose for which the key is retained** that matters.

For example, if the key is used only in an emergency or by arrangement, then exclusive possession may still exist.

The courts will look at whether any right of access the landlord has is **restricted** or **unrestricted**.

If the access is restricted e.g., 'to carry out repairs' then this is seen as more of an acknowledgement of exclusive possession by the landlord, rather than something that will defeat it. This was expressed by the court in [[Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809]]

In [[Aslan v Murphy [1990] 1 WLR 766]] the court held “there is no magic in the retention of a key” – it will not determine the nature of arrangement either way.

### Landlord Provides Services

If the landlord provides attendance or services there is a licence not a tenancy ([[Marchant v Charters [1977] 1 WLR 1181]].)

Services would include cleaning, changing linen etc.

The occupier is simply a **lodger** provided the services are actually carried out, and a **lodger will never enjoy exclusive possession** of the premises.

### Sharing Clauses

If a landlord reserves the right to share the property with the occupiers or reserves the right to introduce others to share, that may mean that there is no exclusive possession, as the occupier **cannot exclude** whoever the landlord is able to introduce.

All of the circumstances must be looked at to see whether this is a **genuine clause** or simply a **sham** to defeat exclusive possession, as was made clear in [[A G Securities v Vaughan [1990] 1 AC 417]] and [[Antoniades v Villiers [1990] 1 AC 417]].

The following circumstances should therefore be considered when determining if a sharing clause is genuine or a sham:

- The size and nature of the accommodation – would it be realistic to introduce others into the accommodation given its size?
- The relationship between the occupiers (if there is more than one) – would it be appropriate to introduce another to share given the relationship between the occupiers?
- The wording of the clause (i.e., how widely it is drafted, as the wider it is drafted, the more likely it is a sham clause.)
- Whether the clause has ever been exercised – if it has not been exercised then this may indicate it is a sham clause.

#### Quiet Enjoyment

If there is a clause for a tenant's 'quiet enjoyment of the land', this points towards a lease ([[Addiscombe Garden Estates v Crabbe [1958] 1 QB 513]]).

### Business Tenancies

[[Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809]] is equally applicable to non-residential tenancies.

A business tenant must also show it has a certain term and exclusive possession of the premises in order to establish it is a tenant, rather than licensee.

In the context of business arrangements, the result affects security of tenure, as business tenants (but not licensees) are protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, entitling them to remain in the premises at the end of the lease term and request a new lease.

In the business context, the court tends to construe the document as a whole to see if the landlord retains control over the property. In this setting, the courts are more prepared to accept the reality of the label 'licence' than they are in the residential context as there tends to be more equality in bargaining power, with commercial leases often negotiated and parties legally represented.

#### Control

The issue of control in a business context came before the court in [[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Fumegrange Ltd and others [1994] 2 EGLR 90]].

#### Right to Relocate

If the occupation agreement contains a right for the landlord to relocate and move the tenant to alternative premises, it will not be a lease.

> …you cannot have a tenancy granting exclusive possession of particular premises, subject to a provision that the landlord can require the tenant to move to somewhere else.  
> [[Dresden Estates v Collinson [1988] 55 P & CR 47]]

Of course, if such a clause is a sham clause, it will not defeat exclusive possession in the circumstances and will be disregarded by the court. The courts will always look at the substance of an arrangement.

## Formalities

The formalities required to create a legal lease will depend on the length of the term of the lease.

| Rules                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| General rule              | To create a legal lease, a deed must be used ([LPA 1925, s 52](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/52)). The requirements of a valid deed are set out in [LP(MP)A 1989, s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/1).                                                                                                                |
| Leases over 7 years       | If the term of the lease is over 7 years, the lease must also be with registered ([LRA 2002, s 27(2)(b)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27)). This is a compulsory registration requirement. If not done a legal leasehold estate will not have been created (LRA 2002, s 27 (1)). |
| Leases of 7 years or less | If the term of the lease is 7 years or less, the lease does not need to be registered. Such leases still take effect as legal leases and will be binding on a new freehold estate owner as an overriding interest ([LRA 2002, sch 3 para 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/schedule/3)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Short Lease Exception

Certain short leases, which fulfil certain conditions, have no formal requirements, yet they will still exist as legal leases. They need not even be in writing.

[LPA 1925, s 54 (2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/54) states that a lease with a term of three years or less need not be created by deed provided the following three conditions are all met:

1. The lease takes effect in possession (i.e., the tenant takes the lease immediately).
2. The lease is granted at 'best rent' (which has been interpreted as meaning ‘market rent’).
3. The lease is not subject to a fine or premium (meaning there is no upfront payment for the grant of the lease, which you could commonly expect to see with very long leases).

These short leases, also called parol leases, whether created by deed or less formally under s 54(2), do not need to be registered to exist as legal leases because only leases of over 7 years must be registered. Leases less than 3 years can even be orally agreed, they don't even need to be in writing.

The types of arrangement which fall within the ambit of this exception are:

- **Short fixed term leases** (those with a maximum term of three years or less.)
- **Express periodic tenancies** (where there is a tenancy agreement.)
- **Implied periodic tenancies** (where an occupier is in possession and paying a rent at regular intervals.)

Note that periodic tenancies, whether express or implied, will only fall within the ambit of [LPA 1925, s 54(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/54) if each individual period of the tenancy is for **three years or less**, which is likely to be the case.

```ad-example
**Short fixed term leases:** A tenant rents a flat for an agreed fixed term of 2 years. This arrangement does not need to be in writing.

**Express periodic tenancies:** A tenant rents a flat on a rolling monthly basis paying an agreed monthly rent. There is a written agreement documenting the agreement. In this situation, the written agreement does not need to comply with any formalities.

**Implied periodic tenancies:** A tenant is in occupation of premises paying an agreed rent on a monthly basis, but nothing documents this arrangement. In this situation, a periodic tenancy may be implied. It will still be a legal lease because no formalities are required to document the arrangement.
```

### Equitable Leases

An equitable lease may be created deliberately, if the parties choose to enter into a contract for lease, or it may be that the parties try to create a legal lease but fail, by either not creating a valid deed or not registering the lease, if required.

The courts will recognise the tenant has having an equitable interest in the land (an equitable lease) on the same terms as the defective legal lease providing:

1. There is a document that complies with [LP(MP)A 1989, s 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/2) - signed contract in writing and incorporating all express terms.
2. The remedy of specific performance is available.

```ad-important
Where there is a conflict between the common law and equity, equity will prevail ([[Walsh v Lonsdale (1882)]])
```

### Key Features of Licences

1. Licences are traditionally regarded as personal permissions, as opposed to being proprietary in nature.
	- Licences are regarded as capable of binding the licensor and licensee only.
	- So licences are interests that operate over land rather than being [[interests in land]].
	- Licences are not proprietary rights capable of binding third parties ([[National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth (1965)]]). Licences can be revoked by the licensor.
	- But this characterisation of licences as purely personal, non-proprietary interests has been subject to criticism and comment.
2. Licences also operate to render lawful conduct which might otherwise constitute a trespass on someone else's land.
3. There are no general formalities for the creation of licences, though some types of licence do require a degree of compliance with formality.
	- Licences can be created orally or in writing, can be express or implied and can be contained within deeds or as part of the conveyancing process
	- May also arise where the formalities for creating proprietary interests fail to be satisfied.
4. The nature and extent of licences is determined by having regard to the specific terms of the licence.

### Traditional Categorisation

| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bare licences                     | A simple permission to enter or be present on another's land (*Robson v Hallett (1967)*)                             |
| Licences coupled with an interest | A permission to enter another's land to remove something from that land (*James Jones v Earl of Tankerville (1909)*) |
| Estoppel licences                 | A permission to enter or use land arising from the operation of [[proprietary estoppel]] (*Inwards v Baker (1965)*)      |
| Contractual licences              | A permission to enter or use land resulting from an implied or express contract (*King v David Allen & Sons Billposting Ltd (1916); Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold (1989)*)                                                                                                                     |
