# Enforcing leasehold covenants

## Enforceability of Leasehold Covenants

![[leases enforceability_1.jpg]]

When leases are granted, both the landlord and the tenant enter into covenants agreeing to do, or not to do, certain things. After a period of time, either the landlord or tenant, or both, will leave the land and sell their interests in the land to new parties. The question is then whether the covenants, made by the original parties, can be enforced by or against the new parties.

Between the original landlord and original tenant there is a contractual relationship (i.e. privity of contract exists here), and therefore enforcement of the covenants will be governed by the normal contractual principles.

However, when the tenant assigns his interest to a successor in title, there is no contractual relationship between the landlord and the new tenant (the assignee). There is no privity of contract between the landlord and the assignee.

Likewise, where the landlord sells his reversionary interest, there is no contractual relationship between his successor in title (the reversioner) and the tenant. There is no privity of contract between the reversioner and the tenant.

### Enforceability

Were covenants to be unenforceable for lack of a contractual relationship between the parties currently in the position of landlord and tenant, then all covenants, when made, would have a very limited lifespan. They would only remain enforceable while the original covenanting parties remained landlord and tenant. They would come to an end as soon as these parties sold their interests in the land. Such a short lifespan of a covenant would not always be convenient.

On the other hand, if every covenant entered into by the original parties were to bind successors in title to these parties, irrespective of the absence of a contractual relationship, successors could find themselves bound to perform all kinds of strange promises. This could potentially make the land less attractive to buyers; an eventuality that courts strive to avoid.

The rules and principles are an attempt to strike a fair balance between the covenants potentially having a short lifespan and the covenants binding all successors in title and potentially making land less attractive to purchase.

The law on the running of covenants in leases was reformed by the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 ('LTA 1995')](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/contents). This Act only applies to leases created after it came into force on 1 January 1996 (‘new leases’). All leases created before this date (‘old leases’) are governed by the old system of rules.

Although you will come across old leases in practice, new leases are now much more common. It is these rules that we will focus on.

## Privity of Contract

Privity denotes the legal relationship between two or more parties to a contract. When a landlord grants a lease to a tenant, the arrangement is a contract, and privity of contract exists between them. The terms of the lease are enforceable under the rules of contract law. All the terms, regardless of their nature, can be enforced by the original landlord against the original tenant and vice versa.

All leases created before **1 January 1996** (‘old leases’) (the date when the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 came into force) are governed by the old system of rules.

Privity of contract is of vital importance in old leases.

In old leases created before 1 January 1996, the liability of the original landlord and the original tenant continues for the full duration of the lease term. This is the case even after an assignment of either the reversion (landlord’s interest) or the lease (tenant’s interest).

The continuing liability of the original tenant, even after having disposed of the lease, was confirmed in [[Thursby v Plant (1668) 1 Saund 230]].

The continuing liability of the original landlord, even after having disposed of the interest in the property, was confirmed in [[Stuart v Joy [1904] 1 KB 362]].

### Original Party Liability

The basic rule = the original landlord and the original tenant are liable for their respective covenants for the entire term of the lease.

This continuing liability of the original parties is reinforced by LPA 1925, s 79(1):

```ad-statute
title: s 79(1) LPA 1925

A covenant relating to any land of a covenantor or capable of being bound by him, shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed, be deemed to be made by the covenantor on behalf of himself his successors in title and the persons deriving title under him or them, and, subject as aforesaid, shall have effect as if such successors and other persons were expressed.
```

This means that the original tenant and the original landlord of an old lease remain liable for the covenants they entered into under the lease long after the leasehold/reversionary interests have been sold or given away to others.

### Effect of Privity of Contract

This continuing liability of the original contracting parties led to both absurdities and hardships for the original parties. For example, many original tenants were held liable for rent payments or for the costs of repairs years after they had assigned their leases.

As a result, the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 changed this principle of original tenant and original landlord liability.

### Privity of Estate

A lease is not only a contract. Provided the formalities are complied with, a lease gives the tenant a legal estate in the land. Where the landlord and the tenant are each owner of a legal estate in the same property (the landlord’s being the freehold, or sometimes a leasehold, reversion and the tenant’s being the leasehold), there is said to be **privity of estate** between them. Privity of estate exists between any current landlord and current tenant of the property.

It follows that, as between an original landlord and an original tenant, there will be both privity of estate and privity of contract because they have a proprietary relationship as well as a contractual one.

Privity of estate was an important concept in old leases, but lost its importance after the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 came into force.

Upon assignment of either the lease or the reversionary interest, privity of contract will remain between the landlord and the tenant, but there will no longer exist privity of estate between them. This is because the leasehold or freehold estate has passed upon assignment from the original contracting party to their successor in title. Consequently, privity of estate will now exist between whomever is the current landlord and tenant.

For example, the tenant transfers his leasehold interest to the assignee:

- Privity of contract exists between landlord and tenant, and privity of estate between landlord and assignee.
- There is no privity of contract between the landlord and the assignee, unless, upon assignment, the assignee was asked by the landlord to covenant directly with the landlord to perform the covenants in the lease, creating a separate and new contractual relationship between them.
- Privity of contract exists between the tenant and the assignee in relation to the transfer of the leasehold estate.

Alternatively, the landlord sells his reversionary interest to the reversioner:

- Privity of contract exists between the landlord and the tenant, and privity of estate between the reversioner and the tenant.
- Privity of contract exists between the landlord and the reversioner in respect of the sale of the reversion.
- There may be privity of contract between the reversioner and the tenant if they have entered into a new contractual relationship together.

Where there exists privity of estate between the parties, the tenant’s covenants in an old lease may be enforceable. However, privity of estate is not the only requirement and other conditions have to be met.

Privity of estate lasts only for the period while the lease is vested in the tenant. The tenant is under no liability for breaches committed before the lease was assigned to him. Equally, once the tenant assigns the lease to a third party, he will not be liable for any breaches committed after he ceases to be a tenant.

The tenant does remain liable after ceasing to be the tenant for any breaches committed while he was the tenant of the property or if he has covenanted directly with the landlord that he will be responsible for breaches of his assignee ([[Estates Gazette Ltd v Benjamin Restaurants Ltd [1995] 1 All ER 129]]).

```ad-summary
- When a landlord grants a lease to a tenant, privity of contract exists between them.
- All the terms of a lease can be enforced by the original landlord against the original tenant and vice versa.
- In old leases, the liability of the original landlord and the original tenant continues for the full duration of the lease term, even after an assignment of the lease or the reversion.
- Privity of estate exists between any current landlord and current tenant of the property.
- Privity of estate lasts only for the period while the lease is vested in the tenant.
- The Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 changed the principle of original tenant and original landlord liability
```

## New Leases

The law on the running of covenants in leases was reformed by the implementation of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 which came into force on 1 January 1996. This Act only applies to leases created on or after 1 January 1996 (‘new leases’). All leases created before this date (‘old leases’) are still governed by the old system of rules.

It is the **date of creation** of the lease which is critical, not the date of any subsequent assignment, as to whether the old rules or the new rules apply to the lease. If the lease is granted on or after 1 January 1996, it is a new lease.

The only **exception** is in the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, sections 17 to 20. These sections are retrospective and apply to all leases.

The Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 makes some fundamental changes to the running of covenants on assignment of a lease / the reversion. This was in part to avoid some of the absurdities and hardships for the original parties as a result of their continuing liability, and to endeavour to make the law fairer.

### Abolishing Original Party Liability

The Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 effectively abolishes privity of contract for all new leases. The effect of this is that the original landlord and the original tenant are no longer liable for the covenants for the full duration of the lease term.

### Assignment of a Lease

A tenant with a new lease will (generally) obtain an automatic release from the tenant’s covenants upon assignment. His liability for a breach of covenant caused by any subsequent assignee ceases when he assigns the lease. The effect of this is that a tenant under a new lease will only be liable for breaches of the covenants contained within the lease while he remains a tenant of the property.

This release mechanism is governed by the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/5).

```ad-statute
title: LT(C)A 1995, s 5

(1) This section applies where a tenant assigns premises demised to him under a tenancy.

(2) If the tenant assigns the whole of the premises demised to him, he—
- (a) is released from the tenant covenants of the tenancy, and
- (b) ceases to be entitled to the benefit of the landlord covenants of the tenancy,

as from the assignment.

(3) If the tenant assigns part only of the premises demised to him, then as from the assignment he—
- (a) is released from the tenant covenants of the tenancy, and
- (b) ceases to be entitled to the benefit of the landlord covenants of the tenancy,

only to the extent that those covenants fall to be complied with in relation to that part of the demised premises.

(4) This section applies as mentioned in subsection (1) whether or not the tenant is tenant of the whole of the premises comprised in the tenancy.
```

However, a tenant will not be released from liability if he is in breach of a tenant covenant. This is due to the effect of:

```ad-statute
title: LT(C)A 1995, s 24(1)

Any release of a person from a covenant by virtue of this Act does not affect any liability of his arising from a breach of the covenant occurring before the release.
```

### Assignment of the Reversion

```ad-important
Unlike the outgoing tenant, there is no automatic release for an outgoing landlord.
```

There is no automatic release of the landlord upon assignment of the reversion of a new lease. The landlord must apply for such a release from the tenant. The Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 6 states:

```ad-statute
title: LT(C)A 1995, s 6

(1) This section applies where a landlord assigns the reversion in premises of which he is the landlord under a tenancy.

(2) If the landlord assigns the reversion in the whole of the premises of which he is the landlord—
- (a) he may apply to be released from the landlord covenants of the tenancy in accordance with section 8; and
- (b) if he is so released from all of those covenants, he ceases to be entitled to the benefit of the tenant covenants of the tenancy as from the assignment.

(3) If the landlord assigns the reversion in part only of the premises of which he is the landlord—
- (a) he may apply to be so released from the landlord covenants of the tenancy to the extent that they fall to be complied with in relation to that part of those premises; and
- (b) if he is, to that extent, so released from all of those covenants, then as from the assignment he ceases to be entitled to the benefit of the tenant covenants only to the extent that they fall to be complied with in relation to that part of those premises.

(4) This section applies as mentioned in subsection (1) whether or not the landlord is landlord of the whole of the premises comprised in the tenancy.
```

To be released from liability, the landlord must follow the procedure laid down in the [LTA 1995, s 8(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/8).

A release is generally granted by the tenant, but if the tenant refuses to release the outgoing landlord from their obligations, the landlord can apply to the court for a release under the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 8(2)(b).

#### Rationale

Why is the outgoing landlord not automatically released? The rationale behind the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 6 is that it is necessary to provide the tenant with some protection against the landlord assigning the reversion to a less reliable landlord. If the tenant refuses to release the landlord, that landlord will remain liable. It is therefore in the interests of the original landlord to find a suitably reliable replacement.

#### In Which Circumstances Will the Landlord Not Be Released?

The procedure under the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 6 will not release a landlord from covenants which are expressed to be personal. In the case of [[BHP Petroleum Great Britain Ltd v Chesterfield Properties Ltd [2002] Ch 194]], Jonathan Parker LJ stated:

> ‘…in our judgment Chesterfield's obligations in… the agreement, being expressed to be personal to Chesterfield, are not “landlord covenants” within the meaning of the 1995 Act, and that the [section 8] notice was accordingly ineffective to release Chesterfield from such obligations…’.

Covenants which are ‘expressed to be personal’ will therefore remain effective between the original landlord and original tenant.

Finally, a landlord will not be released from liability if he is in breach of a landlord covenant in accordance with [LT(C)A 1995, s 24(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/24).

```ad-summary
- If a lease is granted on or after 1 January 1996, it is a new lease, subject to the rules in the **Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995**.
- The original landlord and the original tenant are no longer liable for the leasehold covenants for the full duration of the lease term.
- A tenant with a new lease will obtain an automatic release from the tenant’s covenants upon assignment under **LT(C)A 1995, s 5.**
- The outgoing tenant will only be liable for breaches of the covenants contained within the lease while he was a tenant of the property.
- There is no automatic release of the landlord upon assignment of the reversion of a new lease.
- The landlord must apply for a release from the tenant under **LTA 1995, s 6**, following the procedure laid out in **LT(C)A 1995, s 8.**
