# Remedies & ending lease

## Landlord's Remedies

The remedies available to a landlord in the event a tenant breaches a covenant in the lease are examined.

### Breach of Rent Covenant

The landlord has the following remedies available to it in the event of a breach of the rent covenant by the tenant:

#### Action for Debt

The tenant can be sued on his covenant to pay rent. A landlord can only recover six years’ arrears: [Limitation Act 1980, s 19](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/19). However, if a tenant is unable to pay the rent, it is unlikely to be able to pay any damages awarded by the court.

#### Distress and Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery

Distress was an ancient common law self-help remedy, entitling a landlord to enter the premises as soon as the rent was due and unpaid and to take possession of goods to the value of the rent owed.

If the tenant did not pay within five days, the goods could be sold.

Since the Human Rights Act 1998, concerns had been raised in cases and academic commentary as to whether the self-help remedy of distress was in breach of:

- Article 6: right to a fair trial
- Article 8: respect for private and family life and the home.
- Article 1 (Protocol 1): peaceful enjoyment of possessions.

From 6 April 2014, a landlord's right to levy distress for rent arrears was therefore abolished and replaced with a new regime known as **Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery.**

This requires a landlord to serve an enforcement notice on the tenant, giving seven clear days’ notice that he will seize goods. Once notice has been served, the tenant can apply for it to be set aside or for its execution to be delayed.

```ad-warning
There must be a minimum of seven days' rent arrears in order to use this procedure, and the remedy is not available in respect of mixed use or residential premises.
```

The notice requirements clearly reduce the effectiveness of the remedy from a landlord's perspective because tenants have the opportunity to remove goods from the premises and put them out of the landlord's reach.

#### Forfeiture

This involves bringing the lease to a premature end because of the tenant’s breach. By their nature, breaches of other types of covenant than rent (e.g., repair covenant) require a wider range of remedies, as follows:

- Injunction – For example [[Hemingway Securities Ltd v Dunraven Ltd (1995) EG 322]] in which the landlord was granted an injunction to prevent an unauthorised sublease.
- Specific performance – This is rarely ordered in respect of a repairing covenant; damages will usually be adequate. For example, in the case of [[Jeune v Queen’s Cross Properties Ltd [1974] Ch 97]], the court stated, obiter, that specific performance of a repairing covenant could not be awarded against a tenant.
- Damages – The ordinary contractual rules as to the measure of damages will generally apply.

```ad-summary
In the event of a breach by the tenant of a rent covenant, the following remedies are available to a landlord:

- Action for debt
- Forfeiture - a right to end the tenant’s lease in the event of a breach.
- Distress is an ancient common law remedy that has been abolished due to its incompatibility with the HRA 1998.
- Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery may be available as a remedy to a landlord in the event of breach of a rent covenant where the premises let are commercial. 7 days' notice must be served on the tenant.

If the tenant is in breach of another covenant in the lease, the following remedies are also available to a landlord:

- Injunction
- Specific performance (though this will be rarely granted).
```

## Ending a Lease

A lease is created when one person with an estate in land (the Landlord) grants the temporary right to another person (the Tenant) to use and enjoy that land exclusively.

The right may be granted for weeks, months or years. It may be in a residential or commercial context.

Most people would assume that leases only come to an end when the term of the lease expires. This is certainly one of the primary ways in which a lease can end, but it is by no means the only method. What follows is a description of the various means by which a lease may be concluded.

The different ways a lease can end:

- Effluxion of time
- Notice to quit
- Merger
- Forfeiture
- Break Clause
- Surrender

### By Effluxion of Time

This is the usual common law way in which a lease for a fixed term comes to an end. No notice is needed to end a fixed term.

Note, however, that at the end of the lease, the tenant may have security of tenure.

Security of tenure is a right for a tenant to remain in the premises at the end of the lease term and to request the grant of a new lease.

```ad-example
Many **business tenancies** are protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, Part II. If the tenant follows certain procedures and time limits, he may be entitled to require the landlord to grant him a new lease.

A **residential tenant** may have rights to remain in occupation under the Rent Act 1977 (for private tenancies granted before 15 January 1989) or the Housing Acts 1985 (public sector tenancies) and 1988 (private tenancies granted after 15 January 1989). Since the introduction of assured shorthold tenancies (ASTs) it is now very rare for a residential tenant to have security of tenure.
```

### By a ‘break’ Clause

A lease for a fixed term may contain a provision allowing either party (landlord or tenant or both) to serve notice during its currency to bring it to a premature end.

```ad-example
“Either party may end this lease on the fifth anniversary of the term start date by serving 6 months written notice on the other.”
```

### By Surrender

A surrender is the handing back of the lease by the tenant to the landlord with the landlord’s consent. This results in premature termination of the lease.

### Merger

This is the converse of surrender; the tenant acquires the landlord’s interest, thus becoming his own landlord, and the lease is absorbed by the reversion and destroyed.

A deed of surrender is often entered into in practice to document the agreement. Sometimes a surrender premium will be paid by the tenant to the landlord too.

### Notice to Quit

This is the method for determining a periodic tenancy.

For a yearly tenancy, either side must give at least half a year’s notice to quit to determine the tenancy. Other periodic tenancies, for example quarterly, monthly or weekly, must be determined by a full period’s notice to expire at the end of a complete period.

```ad-defn
A periodic tenancy is a lease that runs from one period of time to another. Each period is seen as an individual lease.
```

### Forfeiture

This is a right for the landlord to terminate the lease prematurely for breach of covenant by the tenant. Also known as a ‘legal right of re-entry’ and a recognised legal interest in the land: [LPA 1925, s 1(2)(e)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1).

## Forfeiture and Waiver

![[forfeiture_1.jpg]]

A lease is a proprietary right to possess the land. One way in which a lease can end early is if a landlord exercises a forfeiture right. This is a right for the landlord to terminate the lease prematurely for breach of covenant by the tenant. This is a very powerful right.

The procedure to forfeit a lease and how the right can be waived by the landlord is explored.

### Legal Leases

There must be an express forfeiture clause in the lease allowing the landlord to forfeit the lease in the event of breach of covenant (or insolvency) by the tenant. Every well-drawn lease should contain a forfeiture clause. The right to forfeit is never implied into a legal lease.

```ad-note
In a legal lease, the forfeiture clause creates a legal right of re-entry (one of the five legal rights listed in LPA 1925, s 1(2)). A forfeiture clause is therefore also known as a re-entry clause.
```

### Equitable Leases

There does not need to be an express forfeiture clause, because a right to forfeit for non-payment of rent is implied into equitable leases as one of the implied usual covenants.

### Exercising the Right

Forfeiture is exercised by the landlord by either:

- peaceably re-entering the property; or
- by obtaining a court order.

There are then different rules, depending on whether the landlord is forfeiting for non-payment of rent or for breach of covenant other than non-payment of rent. However, the methods of forfeiture described above (court order or peaceable re-entry) apply to both types of breach.

In the case of pure business premises the landlord may forfeit by peaceable re-entry i.e., by physically entering, changing the locks and putting up an unequivocal notice that he is forfeiting the lease.

Where the premises are residential, the landlord cannot forfeit without a court order: Protection from Eviction Act 1977, s 2. This includes where the premises are mixed residential and commercial: [[Patel v Pirabakaran [2006] 1 WLR 3112]].

### Forfeiture Procedure

1. Has there been a breach?
2. Is there a forfeiture clause?
3. Has there been a waiver?

The rules relating to waiver apply to breach of rent covenants and breach of other types of covenant.

### 3. Waiver

If the landlord wishes to forfeit, he must not have waived his right to forfeit. The landlord may waive the right to forfeit if:

- he is aware of the acts or omissions giving rise to the right to forfeit; and
- he does some unequivocal act recognising the continued existence of the lease.
	- Example: Demanding, accepting or suing for rent due after the breach; or distraining for rent due, despite knowing about the breach.

Waiver can take place **inadvertently**.

For example, the landlord’s agent sends out a rent demand where the landlord (though not the agent) is aware of the breach ([[Central Estates (Belgravia) Ltd v Woolgar [1972] 1 WLR 1048]]).

Where there is a **continuing** breach (e.g., failure to repair), waiver only lasts until the next day the breach continues, at which point the landlord can then choose to reject the rent and forfeit the lease.

If the breach is **non-continuing** ('once and for all'), such as sub-letting without consent, waiver is permanent, i.e., once rent is accepted the landlord can never again forfeit for that specific breach.

Waiver operates only on the landlord’s right to forfeit. The landlord retains other remedies, such as an action for debt or damages.

Note that waiver can operate in relation to a breach of covenant to pay the rent; the landlord could for example waive the right to forfeit for failure to pay the previous month’s rent, by demanding the next month’s rent.

Non-payment of rent is classified as a non-continuing breach ([[London and County (A&D) Ltd v Wilfred Sportsman Ltd [1971] Ch 764]]).

This means that each individual non-payment of rent (i.e., each missed payment) is deemed to be a separate breach, creating a separate right to forfeit.

So, even if the landlord permanently waives his right to forfeit for one incidence of non-payment of rent, this does not preclude the possibility that the landlord could forfeit for another non-payment of rent in the future (which is a likely possibility in such circumstances).

```ad-summary
Forfeiture is a right for the landlord to terminate the lease prematurely for breach of covenant by the tenant.

Legal leases must contain an express right to forfeit in the lease. This is also called a legal right of re-entry.

A right to forfeit in the event of breach of a rent covenant is implied into an equitable lease.

A right to forfeit can be waived if the landlord **knows about the breach** and then does some **unequivocal act recognising the continued existence of the lease**, such as demanding rent and/or accepting payment of rent.

If the breach is continuing e.g., repair, the right to forfeit will arise again each day the breach continues. If the breach is non-continuing, such as sub-letting without consent, waiver is permanent.

Forfeiture can be exercised by peaceable re-entry or court order. If the premises are residential or mixed residential and commercial, a court order must be obtained.
```

## Breach of a Rent Covenant

A lease can end early if a landlord exercises a forfeiture right. This is a right for the landlord to terminate the lease prematurely for breach of covenant by the tenant. This is a very powerful right. There are then different rules depending on whether the landlord is forfeiting for non-payment of rent or for breach of covenant other than non-payment of rent.

If other payments due to the landlord are expressed in the lease to be paid as additional rent (e.g. service charges) the landlord can forfeit for non-payment in the same way as for rent.

Suppose there has been a breach of rent covenant, there is a forfeiture clause (either express or implied), and there is no relevant waiver. Step 4 is making a formal demand for the rent.

### 4. Formal Demand

The Landlord must first make a formal demand for the exact amount of rent due on the day when it becomes payable, upon the premises, between the hours of sunrise and sunset unless:

- The lease expressly waives this requirement. It usually does so by including in the forfeiture clause words such as ‘whether formally demanded or not’. Or;
- At least six months’ rent is in arrears and there are insufficient distrainable (i.e., seizable) goods on the premises to satisfy all the arrears due (Common Law Procedure Act 1852, s 210).

### 5: Exercise the Right

Once the landlord has made a formal demand, or if a formal demand is not necessary, the landlord can proceed to forfeit by court order or peaceable re-entry as described above.

### 6: Relief

The tenant may then apply for relief from forfeiture. 'Relief' means the court’s discretion to allow the lease to continue and thereby end the forfeiture process. This discretion to grant relief is an ancient equitable jurisdiction, but is now enshrined in various statutes, as explained below.

#### Before the Court Order

If, on the landlord’s suing for possession, the tenant pays into court all arrears and costs before the trial, all further proceedings are stayed.

The legal authority for this depends upon whether the proceedings are in the County Court or High Court:

- County Courts Act 1984, s 138, in the county court;
- Common Law Procedure Act 1852, s 212 in the High Court, provided in the High Court that at least six months’ rent is in arrears ([[Standard Pattern Co Ltd v Ivey [1962] Ch 432]]).

#### At or After the Court Order

The court has a discretion to grant relief, i.e., to allow the lease to continue on condition that the arrears are paid.

Relief is usually given unless the circumstances are exceptional, for example:

- Where the property has already been lawfully let to a new tenant after the forfeiture ([[Stanhope v Haworth (1886) 3 TLR 34]].)
- Where the non-payment of rent is exceptionally bad. No relief was given in [[Public Trustee v Westbrook [1965] 1 WLR 1160]] where no rent had been paid for 22 years, as the site was bombed out and everyone thought that the lease had ended.

When the landlord has re-entered under a court order, the application for relief must be made within **six months** of re-entry (see Common Law Procedure Act 1852, s 210 in the High Court. Similar but slightly different provisions apply in the county court under the County Courts Act 1984.)

After peaceable re-entry if the landlord forfeits a non-residential lease without a court order (or if less than six months’ rent is in arrears), the court has an inherent equitable jurisdiction to grant relief if:

- the rent and landlord’s costs are paid; and
- it is just and equitable to grant relief.

[[Thatcher v Pearce [1968] 1 WLR 748]] – A lease of a scrapyard was determined by peaceable re-entry by the landlord while the tenant was in prison. The tenant applied more than six months after forfeiture for relief and was successful.

#### Sub-tenant

If a head-lease is forfeited, any sub-lease will also be destroyed. A sub-tenant in the premises has the right to apply for relief from forfeiture.

The authority:

- Under [CCA 1984, s 138](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/28/section/138) (county court action);
- [SCA 1981, s 38](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/38) (High Court action);
- [LPA 1925, s 146(4)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/146) (peaceable re-entry).

This is the case even where the head-tenant cannot get relief himself. The court has the power to vest the head-lease in the sub-tenant on such terms as it sees fit, including rent, but cannot grant the sub-tenant a lease for any longer than the term of the original sub-lease.

In summary, under the above provisions, the court usually allows the lease to continue on condition that the tenant pays off the arrears.

```ad-summary
**Step 1:** There must be a breach of covenant.

**Step 2:** There must be a forfeiture clause in the lease.

**Step 3:** The landlord must not have waived the right to forfeit: distinguish here between a continuing and non-continuing breach.

**Breach of rent covenant:**

**Step 4:** The landlord must have served a demand for payment, or the lease must waive this right.

**Step 5:** The landlord can then forfeit the lease for the breach of covenant by peaceable re-entry or court order. However, if the tenancy is residential, the landlord must obtain a court order.

**Step 6:** The tenant, and any sub-tenant, can apply for relief from forfeiture. Relief is the court's discretion to allow the lease to continue. Relief can be applied for regardless of whether the right has been exercised by court order or peaceable re-entry.
```

## Breach of Other Covenants

### Step 4: S 146 Notice

In cases other than non-payment of rent, before the landlord can forfeit they must first serve notice upon the tenant under [LPA 1925, s 146](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/146).

This notice must:

- Specify the breach complained of.
- If capable of remedy, require it to be remedied within a reasonable time.
	- Breaches which are capable of remedy include continuing breaches, for example failure to repair or unauthorised use.
	- What is a reasonable time? This depends upon the nature of the breach. Some textbooks suggest three months as a rule of thumb.
	- If capable of remedy and the tenant does not remedy the breach within a reasonable time, the landlord may proceed to forfeit either by peaceable re-entry or by obtaining a court order (this is compulsory in a residential case).
	- If the breach is not capable of remedy, the landlord must merely give the tenant enough time to consider his position, for example 14 days, before proceeding to forfeit ([[Scala House and District Property Co Ltd v Forbes]].)
- Require the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach if the landlord requires such compensation.
	- The landlord does not have to request compensation if he does not want it ([[Rugby School (Governors) v Tannahill [1935] 1 KB 87]]).

| Case                                                    | Ratio                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Billson v Residential Apartments Ltd [1992] 1 AC 494]]  | Unauthorised alterations may be capable of remedy.                                                                                                                          |
| [[Rugby School (Governors) v Tannahill [1935] 1 KB 87]] | Immoral use was held to be incapable of remedy because of the stigma attached to the premises.                                                                              |
| [[London Scottish Properties v Mehmet 1970 214 EG 837]] | The court construed a covenant against immoral use as one prohibiting the kind of conduct that the great majority of people in this country would condemn as being immoral. |
| [[Hoffman v Fineberg [1949] Ch 245]]                  | Illegal use (unlawful gaming) was held to be incapable of remedy.                                                                                                           |
| [[Van Haarlam v Kasner [1992] 64 P & CR 214]]           | Illegal use (spying) was held to be incapable of remedy but in that case it was held that the landlord had actually waived the right to forfeit.                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Illegal or Immoral Use

Although Greer LJ did not think that the breach of an illegal or immoral use covenant was capable of remedy in the 1930s, more recent case law has been more flexible in its approach, and it now seems that it depends on the facts of the case as to whether an illegal or immoral use covenant is capable of remedy, as per Harman J in [[Van Haarlam v Kasner [1992] 64 P & CR 214]].

It was also held in [[Glass v Kencakes [1966] 1 QB 611]] that such breaches are capable of remedy if the lessee did not know of the illegal or immoral use by a subtenant, as long as the lessee takes immediate steps to stop the use, including forfeiting the sublease within a reasonable time.

Further, even if the breach is incapable of remedy, relief from forfeiture is still possible in the case of immoral use (see [[Ropemaker Properties v Noonhaven [1989] 2 EGLR 50]], where the immoral use had ceased).

In the case of illegal use (in Van Haarlam), the judge said, obiter, that he would have given relief from forfeiture if there had not been waiver, because forfeiture of the lease was out of proportion to the offence.

In [[Expert Clothing (Services and Sales) Ltd v Hillgate House Ltd [1986] Ch 340]], the House of Lords established the test for assessing whether a breach of covenant is capable or incapable of remedy:

> the ultimate question for the court was this: if the section 146 notice had required the lessee to remedy the breach and the lessors had then allowed a reasonable time to elapse to enable the lessee fully to comply with the relevant covenant, would such compliance, coupled with the payment of any appropriate monetary compensation, have effectively remedied the harm which the lessors had suffered or were likely to suffer from the breach? If, but only if, the answer to this question was "No," would the failure of the section 146 notice to require remedy of the breach have been justifiable.

This approach was approved by the Court of Appeal in [[Savva v Hussein (1997) 73 P&CR 150]], stating that the same approach was also relevant to negative covenants.

#### Breach of Repair Covenants

[Leasehold Property (Repairs) Act 1938](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/1-2/34/contents) (LP(R)A 1938) applies to a covenant to repair in any lease (except an agricultural holding) when the lease is granted for at least seven years and there are at least three years still to run.

Where the Act applies and the landlord seeks either forfeiture or damages for breach of a repairing covenant, the s 146 notice (in addition to the usual requirements) must inform the tenant of his right under the 1938 Act to serve a counter notice within 28 days. If the tenant serves a counter-notice, the landlord cannot proceed to claim forfeiture or damages without first obtaining the leave of the court.

The effect of the Act is to limit severely the landlord’s ability to enforce a repairing obligation until the last three years of the lease.

### Internal Decorative Repair

Where the landlord serves notice under LPA 1925, s 146 and the notice relates to internal decorative repairs, the tenant may apply to the court and be wholly or partially relieved of liability to the extent that the court thinks the notice unreasonable (LPA 1925, s 147). Section 147 does not apply to certain covenants, such as to put into decorative repair at the start of a lease, to yield up in a specified state of repair at the end of a lease or to any provision for the maintenance of the structure, amongst others.

#### Conclusion

Most breaches are now technically capable of remedy provided the mischief can be put right by making full recompense to the landlord, leaving the landlord with no lasting damage. However, it is still probably the case that breach of a covenant against assignment or sub-letting, and possibly immoral or illegal use, is technically not capable of remedy. This was all confirmed in an obiter discussion by Neuberger LJ in [[Akici v LR Butlin [2006] 1 WLR 201]].

### Step 5: Exercise the Right

Once the landlord has correctly served a LPA 1925, s 146 notice, the landlord can proceed to forfeit by court order or peaceable re-entry as described above.

If the tenant does not remedy the breach within a reasonable time, the landlord may proceed to forfeit either by peaceable re-entry or by obtaining a court order, which is compulsory in a residential case.

If the breach is not capable of remedy, the landlord must merely give the tenant enough time to consider his position, for example 14 days, before proceeding to forfeit ([[Scala House and District Property Co Ltd v Forbes]]).

### Step 6: Relief

The tenant may then apply for relief from forfeiture. 'Relief' means the court’s discretion to allow the lease to continue and thereby end the forfeiture process. This discretion to grant relief is an ancient equitable jurisdiction, but is now enshrined in various statutes, as explained below.

```ad-statute
title: s 146(2) LPA 1925
Where a lessor is proceeding, by action or otherwise, to enforce such a right of re-entry or forfeiture, the lessee may, in the lessor’s action, if any, or in any action brought by himself, apply to the court for relief; and the court may grant or refuse relief, as the court, having regard to the proceedings and conduct of the parties under the foregoing provisions of this section, and to all the other circumstances, thinks fit; and in case of relief may grant it on such terms, if any, as to costs, expenses, damages, compensation, penalty, or otherwise, including the granting of an injunction to restrain any like breach in the future, as the court, in the circumstances of each case, thinks fit.
```

LPA 1925, s 146(2) provides that, where the landlord is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce forfeiture, the tenant may in the landlord’s action, or in any action brought by himself, apply to the court for relief.

The court may grant or refuse relief as the court, having regard to all the circumstances, thinks fit.

Therefore, in cases of breach of covenants other than rent, the tenant applies for relief under LPA 1925, s 146(2).

It generally depends on how wilful and blatant the breach was, the gravity of the breach, the landlord’s motives for wanting forfeiture, the damage to the premises and whether the breach can be put right. Relief is usually given on condition that the breach is remedied and that the tenant undertakes not to breach the covenant again.

| [[Ropemaker Properties v Noonhaven [1989] 2 EGLR 50]]             | Relief was granted, despite the use of a nightclub for immoral purposes, because the immoral use had ceased, there was no more stigma attaching to the premises, the tenant was excellent in all other respects, the tenant had offered to sell the lease, and the managing director of the tenant was ill. |
| [[Billson v Residential Apartments Ltd [1992] 1 AC 494 1]]          | The House of Lords focused on the granting of relief from forfeiture to a tenant, where the forfeiture is for breach of a covenant other than a covenant to pay rent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The judicial dislike of peaceable re-entry as a method of forfeiture is apparent from Lord Templeman’s judgment in Billson v Residential Apartments. If a landlord is going to forfeit a lease, following the issue of a s146 notice, using this method rather than obtaining a court order, the tenant may still apply for relief within a reasonable time after the landlord’s peaceable re-entry. This is in contrast to the finality of an executed court order, where **no further relief application is available**.

#### Subtenant’s Right to Relief for Non-rent Breaches

LPA 1925, s 146(4) allows a subtenant to apply to the court for relief against forfeiture for breach of other covenants. It is a matter of discretion whether a subtenant will be granted relief. An unlawful subtenant (where no consent was given for the subletting) is unlikely to get relief ([[St Marylebone Property Co v Tesco Stores Ltd [1988] 2 EGLR 40]]). The House of Lords’ interpretation of s 146(2) in Billson must surely apply equally to s 146(4), so that a subtenant must apply for relief within a reasonable time after peaceable re-entry.

```ad-summary
**Step 1:** There must be a breach of covenant.

**Step 2:** There must be a forfeiture clause in the lease.

**Step 3:** The landlord must not have waived the right to forfeit: distinguish here between a continuing and non-continuing breach.

**Breach of a non rent covenant:**

**Step 4:** The landlord must have served a LPA 1925, s 146 Notice.

(Does the breach relate to a repair covenant? Consider does the additional protection under **LP(R)A 1938 or LPA 1925, s 147** apply?)

**Step 5:** The landlord can then forfeit the lease for the breach of covenant by peaceable re-entry or court order. However, if the tenancy is residential, the landlord must obtain a court order.

**Step 6:** The tenant, and any sub-tenant, can apply for relief from forfeiture. Relief is the court's discretion to allow the lease to continue. Relief can be applied for regardless of whether the right has been exercised by court order or peaceable re-entry.
