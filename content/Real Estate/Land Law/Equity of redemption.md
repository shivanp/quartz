# Equity of redemption

## Background

Historically, a mortgage arrangement was governed by the law of contract. Every mortgage deed had a date specified on which the borrower had to repay the loan in full, known as the **legal date for redemption**. If payment was not made on that date, the borrower forfeited the property to the lender, even if the amount owed was small compared to the overall value. Equity intervened to soften this harshness by allowing the borrower to repay the loan at any time **after** the legal date for redemption had passed. This is known as the **equitable right to redeem**, and recognises that a mortgage is [[security]] for a loan and not an opportunity for the lender to gain something more.

[[Equity]] recognises the borrower as the true owner of the property and protects the borrower’s rights as owner. These rights, which include the equitable right to redeem, are collectively known as the **equity of redemption**: essentially they prevent the borrower from exploitation by the lender. In addition to recognising the equitable right to redeem, the equity of redemption protects the borrower from clauses postponing or preventing redemption, collateral advantages and unconscionable terms.

The equity of redemption has a financial value, commonly referred to as the ‘equity’ that people have in their homes, being the market value less the outstanding debt.

The rights that make up the equity of redemption are:

- Equitable right to redeem supplements legal right to redeem
- No postponement or prevention of redemption
- No collateral advantages
- No unconscionable terms

## Postponement of the Right to Redeem

Lenders only make money from borrowers whilst the loan is outstanding. It is in the lender’s interest to keep the borrower ‘on the hook’ for as long as possible. One way of doing this is to push back the legal date for redemption as far as possible, as that date is the first day on which the loan can be repaid: the equitable right to redeem arises on the following day.

Courts look at clauses which postpone the legal date for redemption very closely and will not allow a clause which prevents redemption altogether: [[Toomes v Conset (1745) 3 Atk 261]]. They may allow a lender to postpone the date, but bear in mind the equitable rule that there must be no **clog or fetter** on the equity of redemption. Whether the right to redeem is rendered valueless is a question of fact and degree.

Compare [[Fairclough v Swan Brewery Co Ltd [1912] AC 565]] and [[Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne [1939] Ch 441]].

The outcome in *Knightsbridge v Byrne* may have been different if the mortgage had been granted over a domestic property. Although domestic borrowers are often ‘locked in’ for a period of time, this rarely exceeds a few years. It is possible for the borrower to redeem during the ‘lock in’ period, but inevitably a fee would be payable for the privilege. These arrangements are unlikely to be declared void as long as the borrower is offered a clear advantage, usually in terms of a low interest rate, in exchange for the lock in, understood precisely what was involved and made an informed decision to proceed.

### Options to Purchase

 A mortgage may include an option for the lender to purchase the mortgaged property. This is a proprietary right for the lender to require the borrower to transfer the property to it at some point in the further (an estate contract). Such terms may be declared void as preventing the exercise of the equitable right to redeem. If the lender has the opportunity to buy the property, the borrower inevitably loses the right to take the property back free of the loan, which is fundamental to the nature of a mortgage as security. This is a ‘clog’ on the equity of redemption, and equity will strike such terms down, especially in domestic cases.

 | [[Samuel v Jarrah Timber and Wood Paving Corporation Ltd [1904] AC 323]] | An option granted at the same time as the mortgage will normally be declared invalid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

 | [[Warnborough v Garmite [2003] EWCA Civ 1544]]                           | If the mortgage and option are granted on the same day, but are in fact completely separate, the equity of redemption is irrelevant, and the option can be upheld. The court said that it must look at the ‘substance of a transaction’ to ascertain whether it is substantially a mortgage or not. The label given at the time of the transaction is irrelevant. |

## Collateral Advantages

Lenders are entitled only to the repayment of capital advanced plus interest. If a lender tries to extract additional value from the borrower, the offending term in the mortgage deed may be struck out as being contrary to the equity of redemption. The mortgage is not to be regarded as an opportunity to take anything from the borrower other than the repayment of money. A collateral advantage will be struck out if it is unconscionable, in the nature of a penalty, or if it is repugnant to the equitable right to redeem.

A typical example of a collateral advantage in commercial transactions is the **solus tie.** In these cases, the lenders are often breweries or oil companies. The lender makes it a condition of the mortgage that the borrower buys all its supplies from the lender. For example, if a borrower borrows from a brewery to fund a pub purchase, the lender will impose a solus tie in the mortgage conditions obliging the borrower to buys all beers, wines and spirits from the lender. The interest rate may well be lower than in a deal which does not involve the solus tie.

Generally, solus ties are upheld if they end within the mortgage term.

- [[Biggs v Hoddinott [1898] 2 Ch 307]]

## Unconscionable Terms

The equity of redemption gives the borrower protection from unconscionable terms.

Courts have a well-established inherent equitable jurisdiction to strike out oppressive and unconscionable terms. For courts to interfere, the term in question must be more than simply ‘unfair’ or ‘unreasonable’. Not surprisingly, it is high interest rates which have attracted most attention.

[[Mortgages]] have historically been the subject of complex statutory regimes which have now been simplified. Statutory supervision is now carried out by the Financial Conduct Authority using rules in its FCA Handbook.

Cases decided under the previous statutory regimes are not obsolete: they may still be applied by analogy by courts exercising their equitable jurisdiction today.

- [[Cityland and Property Holdings Ltd v Dabrah [1968] Ch 166]]
- [[Multiservice Bookbinding Ltd v Marden [1979] Ch 84]]

Statutory regime cases now applied by analogy:

| Case                                          | Principle                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Falco Finance v Gough (unreported)]]        | If a penalty interest rate imposed in the event of borrower default far exceeds the lender’s losses in the circumstances then it will be void.                                                                                     |
| [[Davies v Directloans Ltd [1986] 1 WLR 823]] | A lender will not have acted improperly, and a higher interest can be justified if the borrowers have a poor credit history and are a credit risk. The lender may be justified in charging a higher rate in certain circumstances. |
| [[Paragon Finance v Nash [2002] WLR 685]]     | The lender is entitled to take its own commercial needs into account and may be justified in imposing a higher interest rate where it is in financial difficulties itself providing it is not exercising any discretion for an improper purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

A high interest rate might be an unconscionable term, but there is no 'magic number' above which will mean the interest rate is unconscionable. Further, lenders are entitled to make money from loans: if they do not do so, they will simply stop lending, which would be a disaster from commercial, industrial and residential perspectives.

The test established by [[Multiservice Bookbinding Ltd v Marden [1979] Ch 84]] is: has the term been imposed in a “morally reprehensible” manner?

You will need to therefore consider the circumstances in which term was imposed and the factors the court had regard to when making the decisions in both [[Multiservice Bookbinding Ltd v Marden [1979] Ch 84]] and [[Cityland and Property Holdings Ltd v Dabrah [1968] Ch 166]], and the statutory regime cases, which can be applied by analogy.

If a term is declared [[void]], it will not be enforceable (binding) on the borrower, but the remainder of the agreement will remain in force.
