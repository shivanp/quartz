# Overriding Interests

## Overriding Interests

LRA 2002, s 29(2) a purchaser of registered land for valuable consideration will only be bound by:

- Registrable dispositions which have been properly registered;
- Interests which have been properly protected by entry of a notice; and
- Overriding interests

The main aim of [[Land registration]] is to ensure that the register represents a complete record of all of the interests affecting any particular piece of land, enabling a prospective purchaser to view the register and see exactly what interests benefit and burden it.

Overriding interests defeat that aim. These are interests which will bind a purchaser for value, whether a buyer or lender, even though they have not been protected by registration. Their recognition has been contentious ever since they were introduced in the Land Registration Act 1925 because they undermine the integrity of the register. Although the number and scope of such interests was reduced under the Land Registration Act 2002 there are still several types of interest which do not appear on the register yet will still bind a purchaser.

Overriding interests may be said to provide a safety net of protection for those who are not able to, have not, or cannot reasonably be expected to take steps to protect their [[interests in land]]. The Law Commission considered abolishing overriding interests altogether, but recommended retaining them in limited form as set out in Land Registration Act 2002, Schedule 3. Their continued existence means that inspections and enquiries which go beyond simply looking at the registers of title will still be needed.

### Overriding Unregistered Disposition

These are set out in [LRA 2002 Sch 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/schedule/1). Most common are:

1. leases for seven years or less;
2. an interest belonging to a person in actual occupation;
3. a legal easement or profit; and
4. a local land charge.

### Overriding Registered Disposition

Where land is already registered, the list of overriding interests is set out in [LRA 2002, Schedule 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/schedule/3). If there is a ‘registrable disposition’ of the land, the new registered proprietor will take the land subject to any overriding interests. By far the most common are those listed in LRA 2002, Schedule 3 paragraphs 1, 2 & 3.

| LRA 2002 Schedule 3 | Overriding interest                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paragraph 1         | Legal leases granted for a term of seven years or less.                                     |
| Paragraph 2         | Equitable interests held by people in actual occupation of the land, subject to exceptions. |
| Paragraph 3         | Implied legal easements or profits a prendre, if conditions are met.                        |                                                                                             |

#### 1. Leasehold Estates in Land

> [!statute] LRA 2002 Sch 3 para 1
> A leasehold estate in land granted for a term not exceeding seven years from the date of the grant, except for— 
> 
> (a) a lease the grant of which falls within section 4(1)(d), (e) or (f);
> 
> (b) a lease the grant of which constitutes a registrable disposition.

Legal leases for more than seven years are registrable dispositions: [LRA 2002, s 27(2)(b)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27). As part of the registration process, a note of the lease will be added to the register of the freehold title, and it will be binding on a new freehold owner.

**Legal** leases which are shorter than this do not have to be substantively registered and will bind a new freehold owner as overriding interests. The rationale for this is two-fold.

1. There are too many short leases in existence to make registration a practical proposition.
2. It is unreasonable to expect those who occupy premises under short leases, especially residential short leases, to register them. Frequently these arrangements are entered into without legal advice, and it is asking too much of tenants to expect them to realise that they must protect their interests by registration.

#### 2. Interests of Persons in Actual Occupation

Equitable leases do not fall within this provision but may fall within Sch 3 para 2. This sets out the most important and controversial category of overriding interests:

> [!statute] LRA 2002 Sch 3 para 2
> 
> An interest belonging at the time of the disposition to a person in actual occupation, so far as relating to land of which he is in actual occupation, except for—
> 
> (a) an interest under a settlement under the Settled Land Act 1925 (c. 18);
> 
> (b) an interest of a person of whom inquiry was made before the disposition and who failed to disclose the right when he could reasonably have been expected to do so;
> 
> (c) an interest—
> - (i) which belongs to a person whose occupation would not have been obvious on a reasonably careful inspection of the land at the time of the disposition, and
> - (ii) of which the person to whom the disposition is made does not have actual knowledge at that time;
> 
> (d) a leasehold estate in land granted to take effect in possession after the end of the period of three months beginning with the date of the grant and which has not taken effect in possession at the time of the disposition.

The provision does have exceptions, but the scope of the basic provision must be considered first. It has a wide reach, as it has the effect of enforcing equitable trust interests, which have not been overreached, against purchasers and lenders.

> [!guid] Rationale
> The Law Commission explained why it felt it necessary to retain this class of overriding interest in the LRA 2002. First, it felt that it was unreasonable to expect people whose interests had arisen informally, for example under implied trusts, to take formal steps to protect those interests. Second, when people occupy land, they tend not to appreciate that their position may be precarious, and therefore do not think about whether they need to do anything to protect their position. The category of overriding interests based on actual occupation is therefore designed to protect people who do not realise that they are in a vulnerable position.

It is not the fact of occupation that creates an overriding interest. Mere occupation by itself is of no effect. Rather, what is required is for an individual to have a proprietary right (i.e. one recognised under normal land law principles) over a property. If that individual couples the interest with actual occupation of the property, it is the proprietary interest that will become overriding.

> [!danger]
> Interest in land + Actual occupation = Overriding interest (subject to exceptions)

The interest must be a qualifying proprietary ‘interest in land’ rather than a personal right, and classic examples are: equitable interests under trusts of land; equitable leases; options to purchase; and interests arising by way of estoppel.

##### Qualifications

Protecting a proprietary interest by virtue of occupation is a fall-back position and the interest should ideally be protected by substantive registration. An overriding interest which arises under a trust of land can always be overreached.

##### Actual Occupation

There is no definition of ‘actual occupation’ in LRA 2002. In [[Link Lending v Bustard [2010] EWCA Civ 424]], Mummery LJ said that case law decided under the equivalent provision in LRA 1925, s 70(1)(g) can assist but said:

> ‘The trend of the cases shows that the courts are reluctant to lay down, or even, suggest, a single test for determining whether a person is in actual occupation.’

He set out a non-exhaustive list of factors which should be considered when deciding whether someone is in actual occupation of land. It must be noted that weight is given not simply to objective matters, but also to the subjective intentions and wishes of the person who holds the interest:

> ‘The degree of permanence and continuity of presence of the person concerned, the intentions and wishes of that person, the length of absence from the property and the reason for it and the nature of the property and personal circumstances of the person are among the relevant factors.’

| [[Stockholm Finance Ltd v Garden Holdings Inc [1995] NPC 162]] | There will be a point at which a prolonged absence means there is no actual occupation. For example, protracted periods of absence in a second home elsewhere will make an argument for actual occupation unsupportable. |

##### Exceptions

LRA 2002, Sched 3, para 2 (b) sets out one of two situations in which there will be no overriding interest even though the holder is in actual occupation.

An interest will not override a disposition where it is:

> ‘an interest of a person of whom inquiry was made before the disposition and who failed to disclose the right when he could reasonably have been expected to do so.’

It is the holder of the interest (or their solicitor) who must be asked and fail to disclose. Those who do not know they have an interest cannot reasonably be expected to disclose it so it remains overriding.

LRA 2002, Sched 3, para 2(c) sets out the second situation in which there will be no overriding interest even though the holder is in actual occupation.

An interest will not override a disposition where it is:

> ‘an interest –  
> (1) which belongs to a person whose occupation would not have been obvious on a reasonably careful inspection of the land at the time of the disposition, and  
> (2) of which the person to whom the disposition is made does not have actual knowledge at the time.’

This protects purchasers from interests which they do not know about, and where there is no obvious actual occupation to prompt an enquiry.

It is the occupation which would not have been obvious. Both elements must be met if the interest is to lose overriding status. It is the interest which the purchaser does not know about, not the person.

#### 3. Easements and Profits a Prendre

> [!statute] LRA 2002 Sch 3 para 3
> 
> (1) A legal easement or profit a prendre, except for an easement, or a profit a prendre which is not registered under [Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006], which at the time of the disposition—
> - (a) is not within the actual knowledge of the person to whom the disposition is made, and
> - (b) would not have been obvious on a reasonably careful inspection of the land over which the easement or profit is exercisable.
> 
> (2) The exception in sub-paragraph (1) does not apply if the person entitled to the easement or profit proves that it has been exercised in the period of one year ending with the day of the disposition.

Expressly granted legal easements are registrable dispositions: **LRA 2002, s 27(2)(d)**. As part of the registration process, the easement will appear in the property register of the benefited land, and on the charges register of title of the burdened land. As it is properly registered, it will be binding on a new freehold owner.

This means that **Sched 3 para 3** relates mainly to implied legal easements.

The remainder of the provision is not very easy to follow. It limits the number of easements which can bind as overriding interests by setting out some exceptions. It then complicates matters further by setting out an exception to the exception!

> [!summary]
> Taken altogether, Sched 3 para 3 states that an implied legal easement will be binding as an overriding interest if:
> 
> 1. The new owner knew about it or
> 2. The new owner did not know about it, but it was obvious on a reasonable inspection of the land or
> 3. It has been exercised within the 12 months immediately before the disposition.

Therefore, most implied legal easements, even those which are not obvious, will be overriding interests as it is highly likely that they will have been exercised recently. For example, an easement through an underground drain, not visible from the surface, will be binding if it has been used recently. This is good news for the holder of the easement but not such good news for the new owner of the burdened land, who will be bound by it.

##### Transitional Provisions

However, there are again transitional provisions. Any easement or profit that was an overriding interest immediately prior to 13 October 2003 will retain that status.

> [!caution]
> For exam purposes, always start with the basic rule in s 28, then consider whether s 29 applies, then consider any overriding interests and explain why they are overriding.
