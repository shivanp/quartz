# Planning & Building Regulations

## Town and Country Planning

### Planning System

- The planning system exists to ensure the development of land is carried out in a planned way.
- Local Planning Authority (LPA) usually responsible for grant or refusal of planning permission, and taking enforcement action.
- Guided by policies including:
	- Development plan and Local Development Framework (LDF)
	- Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) guidance, including National Planning Policy Framework.
		- Considers sustainable development.
		- Economic, social and environmental objectives.
- Legislation: Town and Country Planning Act 1990
- Transaction
	- Very important.
	- Affects whether building can be built, altered or extended.
	- Heavy fines for breaching planning controls

### When is Planning Permission Needed

#### Development

Required for any activity constituting 'development'.

```ad-defn
1. The carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land. This can include the erection of new buildings and alteration to existing buildings; and/or
2. The making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land.
```

Material is a question of fact and degree in each case.

#### Not Development

Excluded from the definition of development are:

1. Works for maintenance, improvement or other alteration affecting only the interior/ not materially affecting the exterior
2. Use of buildings or land within the 'curtilage' (garage, garden) of a dwelling house for any incidental purpose.
3. Changes of use within the same use class.
	- Classes specified by Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987
	- e.g., “professional services” grouped together as a use class; bookshops and cafes grouped together.

Note:

- A change between use classes is likely to count as a material change of use.
- Splitting a dwelling house in two counts as development
- Some uses ('sui generis') are expressly excluded from any category.
	- Includes petrol stations, night clubs, scrapyards, hot food takeaways and casinos.
	- Changes to/ from always require planning permission.

#### Express PP Not Required

- Town and Countr y Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (GDPO) automatically grants planning permission to development falling in scope
- So planning permission needed, but no need to apply because it will be granted automatically.
- Most commonly:
	- Development within the curtilage of a dwelling house
	- Minor operations
		- e.g., fences, gates
	- Changes of use
		- e.g., from hotel to state-funded school
		- Many exceptions which keep changing, consult table.
	- Extension/ alteration of an office building, shop, financial or professional services establishment, industrial unit or warehouse.
		- Subject to restrictions.

```ad-warning
- Consider conditions imposed under GPDO
- Rights may be excluded/ varied in certain areas, e.g., conservation areas or areas of outstanding natural beauty. 
- LPA has the power to restrict GPDO in its area ("Article 4 Direction").
```

##### Overlapping LPA Powers

1. Local planning authorities also have the power to issue ‘local development orders’. These operate like permitted development under the GPDO, and may be site-specific or cover the whole or part of an LPA’s area.
2. Under Localism Act 2011, LPA can make "neighbourhood development orders" and "community right to build orders" (giving a community the right to build without requiring planning permission). LPA entering the site on a brownfield land register triggers a grant of permission for the land.

#### Demolition

The Town and Country Planning (Demolition –  
Description of Buildings) Direction 2014 (which applies to England but not Wales) excludes  
the total demolition of the following from the definition of ‘development’:

1. any building of less than 50 cubic metres volume;
2. any means of enclosure (such as a gate, fence or wall), except if it is in a conservation area.

In most cases, planning permission for demolition will be granted automatically. Exceptions:

- Demolition of certain buildings in a conservation area
- Demolition likely to impact environmental substantially
- Demolition of a listed building requires listed building consent, but not PP
- Partial demolition (usually PP required).

### Obtaining PP

#### General

- Apply to the relevant LPA, enclosing fee.
- Don't need to own freehold to apply, but must notify owner.
- Requirements about content of application and consultation/ publicity requirements.

#### Types

| Application for             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outline planning permission | Establishes whether the scale and nature of a proposed development would be acceptable to a local planning authority. Can be obtained for a new building, but not a change of use. Less detailed than full application. Approval for details must be sought before works can start. |
| Full planning permission    | Comprehensive. Costly, but no need for a further reserved matters application.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Permission in principle     | Method of obtaining permission for small scale 'housing-led' development. Stage 1: establishes whether a site is suitable in principle; stage 2: technical details consent. Certain types of development are excluded, where the development is large/ complicated/ environmentally impactful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### LPA Decision

LPA must make a decision within certain time limits. Failure to do so gives the applicant a right of appeal.

#### Duration

- Full permission: development must usually be started within **3 years** of the grant of planning permission.
- Outline permission: application for approval of reserved matters must be made within 3 years, and development commenced within 2 years of reserved approval.
- Express permission: Technical details consent must be obtained within 3 years (and this achieves a full planning permission).

No time limit for development to be completed, though if not completed in reasonable time, the LPA can issue a completion notice, specifying a time limit for completion. If not met, planning permission treated as withdrawn.

#### Planning Obligations

- Developer cannot be required to make a payment in return for the grant of planning permission.
- Developer may be required to contribute towards local infrastructure, if a demand is placed on this by the development
	- e.g., housing development creating a need for extra school classrooms.
		- See s 106 TCPA 1990.
- Reg 122 Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 provides that a planning obligation may constitute a reason for granting planning permission only if the obligation is:
	- Necessary to make the development acceptable.
	- Directly related to development
	- Fairly and reasonably related to development.
- The Planning Act 2008 introduced the **Community Infrastructure Levy** (CIL), a form of discretionary tax that an LPA may choose to charge on developments which impact on local infrastructure.

### Enforcement

#### Time Limits

| Enforcement wrt                                                  | Time limit |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Building works/ changing a building use to single dwelling house | 4 years   |
| Anything else                                                    | 10 years           |

Localism Act 2011 has introduced a power for an LPA to apply to a magistrates’ court for a planning enforcement order, where breach of planning control concealed (regardless of time limits).

#### Enforcement Powers

Include:

- Enforcement notice
	- State the breach, steps to remedy and time to take action.
- Stop notice
	- Served in conjunction with enforcement notice.
	- Stops activity pending appeal by recipient.
- Temporary stop notice
	- Stop while more permanent action is considered.
- Breach of condition notice
	- Notifies of breach of condition attached to planning consent.
	- Recipient cannot appeal.
- Injunction.

```ad-danger
Non-compliance with an operative enforcement or other notice is a **criminal** offence.
```

## Listed Buildings & Conservation Areas

Buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest, it may be ‘listed’. There are different grades of listing.

Consequently, listed building consent is required for the total demolition of a listed building and alterations or extensions that affect the building’s character as a building of special interest.

Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (‘ERRA 2013’) introduced the ability for the Secretary of State to make a consent order allowing alterations or extensions to listed buildings nationally (‘Listed Building Consent Order’) or to certain types of listed building or listed buildings in a specific area (‘Local Listed Building Consent Order’).

Listed building owners can enter into a 'heritage partnership agreement' with a local authority.

Criminal sanctions for non-compliance.

## Building Regulation Control

Building regulation control is concerned with the health and safety aspects of the building to be erected or altered, and regulates the types of materials and construction methods used in carrying out the work.

Building regulation consent may be required irrespective of whether the works constitute  
development for the purposes of planning control.

### Compliance

Two ways to make an application:

| Type of application         | Details                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full plans application      | Requires submission of detailed plans and details of construction. |
| Building notice application | Simple form                                                                   |

After inspection, local authority will issue a certificate of compliance. There are self-certification schemes for competent contractors.

### Non-compliance

Care must be taken when seller unable to produce proof of compliance:

- Local authority enforcement powers
	- Can bring a prosecution for breach of building regulation control within 2 years of the completion of the work.
	- Can serve enforcement notice requiring alteration/ removal of work within 1 year of alleged breach.
- Structural concerns
	- Could lead to expensive repairs/ remedial work.

```ad-action
- The buyer should consider asking the seller to obtain a regularisation certificate from the local authority which will list the work required to bring the building up to the correct standard. 
- Insurance can be obtained in cases where proof of building regulation consent is not forthcoming
- The buyer’s lender must also be informed of any breach, who may insist on a full survey. 
```

## Transactional Matters

### Acting for Seller

- When was property built and uses since
- Additions/ alterations/ extensions
- Activities potentially requiring planning permission.
- Any breaches of covenant
- Listed building/ conservation area
- Compliance with building regulations.

#### Acting for Buyer

- Ensure no problems with planning/ related matters
- Have irregularities corrected at seller's expense/ take out indemnities from them.
- Ask buyer about plans for property.
- Consider restrictive covenants and building regulations.

## Environmental

Contamination in land is bad:

- Makes land difficult to sell or mortgage.
- LPA may impose onerous conditions to develop the land.
- Potential Environmental Protection Act 1990 consequences, or consequences under common law.

Remediation can be expensive. Undertake a **CON29 search** to check whether the land has been designated contaminated by the local authority.

### Contaminated Land Regime

Introduced under EPA 1990.

- Each local authority is under a duty to inspect its area for contaminated sites.
- Local authority must serve a remediation notice specifying steps necessary to clean up site.
- Served on whoever caused/ knowingly permitted pollution.

### Planning and Contamination

Environmental concerns ⇾ LPA likely to impose conditions of decontamination/ investigation.
