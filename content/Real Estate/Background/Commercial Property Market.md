# Commercial Property Market

## Clients

Real estate clients:

- Owner occupiers
- Tenants
- Investors
- Developers
- Lenders

### Owner Occupiers

64% of residential homes in the UK are owner occupied. But only 33% of commercial properties are owner occupied.

### Tenants

Essential characteristic of lease: exclusive possession. Short-term residential tenants may want maintenance etc. done for them. In commercial cases, the obligation for repairs and maintenance usually falls on the landlord.

### Investors

Uninterrupted stream of rental income. The Shard is 95% owned by a Qatari sovereign wealth fund. The Gherkin is owned by a Belgian billionaire.

### Developers

May be looking to acquire land to build from scratch/ demolishing existing buildings/ renovating businesses.

### Lenders

Lenders are traditionally risk averse (although questionable whether this still holds). More interested in the borrower than the property itself, though they still want to ensure that the property is worth enough.

## Commercial Property

```ad-defn
Property which is not meant for residential use or use in primary industries. 
```

Includes retail, offices, industrial, etc.

## Real Estate Transactions

### Sale and Purchase

1. Sale & purchase
	1. Asset sale, or
		- Whole business sale; sale of everything the company owns.
		- Known as Transfer of Business as a Going Concern.
		- Alternative to selling assets off piecemeal.
	2. Share sales
		- Company retains ownership of the land, staff, IP etc., just the ownership of the company changes.

#### Tax

When would you choose one transaction over the other? Tax.

Type of tax: stamp duty land tax. Payable on land sale based on purchase price.

For a share sale, it is just stamp duty. This is payable at a lower rate on the purchase price on shares.

Also come across VAT. Will be payable on a share sale, and may be payable on asset sales. Occasionally, the seller will have a choice as to whether they will charge VAT.

### Other Transactions

Other transactions include:

- Letting
	- Early stages are similar to sale and purchase
	- Inquire about landlord's title and any burdens on land etc.
	- Need to also agree on terms of lease, length, rent payable.
	- Commercial leases are 10-15yrs generally.
	- Usually there are rent review provisions, for every ~5 years.
	- Depends on whether it is lease of an entire building or some part.
	- Leases must be institutionally acceptable
		- Also known as clear leases
		- Landlord receives rent 'clear' of any expenditure
		- So tenant responsible for upkeep, must pay service charges etc.  
- Secured lending
	- If the borrower defaults, the land or property can be used to enforce the security (mortgage).
	- Lenders should not lend up to the full value of the property.
	- Borrower pays interest on the term of the loan
	- Even cash rich investors will usually take out a loan.
		- Interest paid on loan is a deductible expense
		- Interest lower than potential return on capital from investing cash.
	- Process of due diligence for both the buyer and the lender.
- Development.
	- Initial stages similar to a sale and purchase.
	- More work in terms of planning law
	- Might have to deal with adjoining owners: right to light tussles.
	- Managing environmental risks.
	- Employing design and construction teams.
	- Developer will want to let building to good quality tenants
	- Want to sell building for a profit.
	- Lenders will be reluctant to lend the entire amount to the developer upfront. So usually this happens in stages.
	- So development transactions are usually the most challenging (and rewarding) real estate transactions.

## Module

Caveat emptor: means buyer beware.

### S&P Stages

- Pre-exchange stage
	- Due diligence.
	- Subject to contract: either party can walk away with no consequences if there is something they don't like.
- Exchange of contracts
	- Deposit paid from the buyer to the seller, traditionally 10% in the purchase price
	- From here, the buyer has an equitable interest in the property.
- Pre-completion stage
	- Solicitor checking transfer document
	- Practicalities
	- Ensuring existing mortgage is paid off.
- Completion
	- When the transfer document is completed and the balance of purchase monies is paid.
- Post-completion stage.
	- Payment of Stamp Duty Land Tax
	- Register with Land Registry
	- Legal ownership passes at registration.

Distribution of the work involved? Most work is done pre-exchange by the buyer's solicitor.

Miscellaneous:

- How will purchase be funded?
- Money laundering due diligence, mortgage fraud, establishing identity of client.
- Drafting is a key skill throughout.
- Negotiation and research also relevant.
