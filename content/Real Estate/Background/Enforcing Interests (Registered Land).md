# Enforcing Interests (registered land)

## Context

The Land Registration Act 2002 places all estates and [[interests in land]] into one of three categories, and explains what must be done in terms of registration in order to make those estates and interests binding on new owners of the servient land.

The three categories are:

1. Registrable dispositions
2. Interests protected by entry
3. Overriding interests

**S 29(1)** states that a purchaser for valuable consideration of registered land will take the land free of all interests which should have, but which have not, been properly protected. The purchaser will still be bound by overriding interests.  
**LRA 2002, s 28** sets out what is known as the ‘normal rule of priority’. In fact, this rule only applies to a minority of transactions, as most transactions and dispositions are for valuable consideration and therefore s **29** applies.  
**S 28** is limited in scope to transactions not made for valuable consideration: where the new owner is a ‘donee’ who has been gifted or who has inherited the land. Donees will take the land subject to all pre-existing interests, irrespective of whether they have been protected by registration.

## Registrable Dispositions

It is logical to start with the ‘basic rule of priority’ in [LRA 2002, s 28](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/28). It states that an interest of whatever kind will take priority over later dispositions.

```ad-example
If A has a registered freehold estate and grants an easement to B, then enters a covenant with C, then sells the freehold to D, D will take the freehold subject to the pre-existing easement and covenant. That seems to be entirely logical.
```

[LRA 2002, s 29](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/29) provides an important exception to this rule, which operates in the majority of transactions affecting land: a disposition of a registered estate for valuable consideration.

A registrable disposition of a registered estate, made for valuable consideration, will take priority over any pre-existing rights in the land except those which have been protected by entry of a notice on the register or those which are overriding interests.

In other words, if A buys freehold land and registers the disposition, A will take the land subject to interests which have been protected by entry of a notice, and overriding interests. A will not take the land subject to any interests which should, but have not, been registered.

This means that s 28 and the normal rule of priority is limited in scope to transactions not made for valuable consideration: where the new owner is a ‘donee’ meaning they have been gifted or have inherited the land. Donees will take the land subject to all pre-existing interests, irrespective of whether they have been protected by registration.

Where the transaction is for valuable consideration, s 28 has no application and the situation is governed by s 29. The new owner will be bound only by pre-existing interests which are either registrable dispositions which have been properly registered, interests properly protected by a notice or overriding interests.

```ad-defn
To achieve an accurate register of title, [LRA 2002, s 27](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27) states that some transactions, set out in s 27(2) and called ‘registrable dispositions’, must be completed by registration. S 27(1) states that the dispositions do not operate ‘at law’ until the registration has been completed.
```

Some of the dispositions listed in s 27(2) relate to legal estates. The transfer of an existing registered freehold or leasehold estate must be completed by registration: s 27(2)(a); as must the grant of a new lease for a term of more than seven years: s 27(2)(b).

### Express Legal Easements

The express grant or reservation of an easement is a ‘registrable disposition’: [LRA 2002, s 27(2)(d)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27). This means that once the formalities of a deed have been met, the deed must be submitted for registration and the easement will not be legal until it has been properly registered.

The easement will then appear on the property register of the dominant land and in the charges register of the burdened land. It will be a properly registered disposition and will bind a purchaser for valuable consideration, [LRA 2002, s 29(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/29). If the disposition is not registered then a purchaser for valuable consideration will take the land free of it, s 29(1) although a donee will still be bound s 28.

### Grant of a Legal Charge

The grant of a legal charge by a borrower is a ‘registrable disposition’:[LRA 2002, s 27(2)(f)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27). As with express legal easements, it must be created by a deed which is submitted for registration. The charge will not be legal until it has been properly registered, and failure to do so has a huge impact on the lender’s powers to repossess and sell.

Once registered, it appears in the charges register of the mortgaged land. As a properly registered disposition it will bind a purchaser for valuable consideration [LRA 2002, s 29(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/29), which includes a subsequent lender. If the charge is not registered, a new lender will not be subject to it and will rank first in priority, s 29(1).

### Grant of a Landlord's Right of Entry

The grant of a landlord’s right of entry, known as a right of forfeiture, is a ‘registrable disposition’: [LRA 2002, s 27(2)(e)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27). As with other legal interests, it must be created by a deed and must be submitted for registration. The right will not be legal until it has been properly registered.

A right of entry is a right to bring a legal estate, a lease, to an end. It is a very powerful right which has drastic consequences for the tenant, thus it is logical that it has a high degree of formality to meet.

### Summary

The following are registrable dispositions (s 27(2) LRA 2002):

1. Transfer of registered freehold or leasehold
2. Grant of lease $>7$ years
3. Express grant or reservation of an easement
4. Grant of a legal charge
5. Grant of a landlord's right of entry

## Equitable Interests Protected by Entry

There are two methods for protecting equitable interests.

### Notices

Most equitable interests must be protected by entry of a notice in the Charges Register of the burdened land if they are to bind a purchaser for value of that land: [LRA 2002, s 32](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/32).

- If an interest is protected this way, it will bind subsequent purchasers, who may be buyers or lenders: [LRA 2002, s 29(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/32).
- If an interest is not so protected, subsequent purchasers will not be bound by the interest: [LRA 2002, s 29(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/29).
- However, a donee will always be bound by an equitable interest, whether or not protected by notice: [LRA 2002, s 28](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/28).

#### Interests Protected

A notice is the appropriate way to protect an interest which is intended to last beyond a change of ownership. Interests which cannot be protected by notice are set out in [LRA 2002, s 33](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/33). The most commonly encountered interests which cannot be protected by notice are beneficial interests under trusts (which can be protected by a restriction), and short legal leases for a term of three years or less (which are binding as overriding interests).

A notice is intended to bring the relevant equitable interest to the attention of a purchaser, notifying them that the interest will be binding if the purchaser proceeds.

The entry of the notice does not guarantee that the interest has been properly created so as to be valid. It simply means that if the interest has been properly created, it will be binding.

Some interests must be protected by notice; others may be, but do not have to be. For example, legal leases which are granted for more than three years and up to seven years can be, but do not have to be protected by notice as they will still be binding as overriding interests.

Interests protected by notice (s 32):

1. Restrictive covenants affecting freehold land
2. Estate contracts
3. Equitable easements
4. Rights under estoppel claims
5. Occupation rights under Family Law Act 1996
6. Legal leases of $T$ years, $3 \leq T \leq 7$ → optional

#### Types of Notice

Since 13/10/2003, there are two types of notice: agreed and unilateral.

| Notice     | Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agreed     | Need the consent of the registered proprietor (except for spouse/ civil partner home rights under FLA 1996)                                                                     |
| Unilateral | Can be entered on the register without the consent of the proprietor. Land Registry notifies the proprietor, who can apply to the Land Registry to have the notice 'cancelled'. |

#### Cancellation Procedure

- Land Registry procedure
	- Proprietor applies to Land Registry
	- Land Registry notifies beneficiary that an application for cancellation was made, and the beneficiary has 15 business days to attempt to prove the validity of the interest claimed.
	- Land Registry determines whether this is valid.
	- Beneficiary can ask the notice to be removed.
- Court procedure
	- Court has jurisdiction to determine a claim to cancel unilateral notice ([[Nugent v Nugent [2013] EWHC 4095 (Ch)]])
	- This may be preferred as potentially quicker than Land Registry procedure.

### Restrictions

Restrictions are not a permanent way of protecting interests. They are short-term entries which direct the purchaser to do something specific in order for their purchase to be properly registered: [LRA 2002, s 40](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/40).

In other words, the interests which are protected by restrictions are not intended to last beyond a change of ownership. They are instructions which must be obeyed in order for the purchaser’s transfer to be registered.

Typically, such an entry is made where co-owners hold as beneficial tenants in common, where the land is held on trust or strict settlement, or where the proprietor is a limited company or a charity subject to restrictions on its powers of disposition (e.g., during insolvency).

#### Interests Protected

A restriction in the Proprietorship register is the appropriate way to protect an interest which is not intended to last indefinitely ([s 40 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/40)). It is a means by which conditions can be imposed on a purchaser: it is only when the conditions have been fulfilled can, for example, the transfer of the freehold to a purchaser be registered.

The best example of use of a restriction is a beneficial interest under a trust. In this type of case, a restriction might instruct a purchaser to pay the capital money to at least two trustees, ensuring that the beneficiary’s interest is overreached and converted into an interest in the sale proceeds.

A restriction may also be entered where the registered proprietor of the land is bankrupt. In that situation, the trustee in bankruptcy may enter a restriction to the effect that no disposition of the land may be registered without the trustee in bankruptcy’s consent. This ensures that no sale can take place without the trustee’s knowledge, and the trustee’s consent can be granted on condition that the sale proceeds are paid direct to the trustee, rather than the bankrupt.

Where tenants in common are registered as proprietors, the following restriction will be entered:

> No disposition by a sole proprietor of the registered estate (except a trust corporation) under which capital money arises is to be registered unless authorised by an order of the court.

```ad-important
Restrictions cannot prevent dispositions altogether: they simply impose conditions which must be fulfilled before the disposition can be registered.
```

### Old Methods

The LRA 1925 set out four methods of protecting ‘minor interests’ by entries on the register. These were notices, cautions, restrictions and inhibitions. Under the LRA 2002, cautions and inhibitions are abolished for the future (although existing registrations will remain and so will be encountered in practice).

#### Cautions

Under the LRA 1925, a notice could be entered only with the consent of the registered

proprietor. Where the entry of a notice was not possible (e.g., where the proprietor did not consent to the application–perhaps because he disputed the claim) a caution could be used.

This, however, provided only temporary protection for the owner of the interest claimed. On an application to register a subsequent disposition, the claimant would be given a limited period of time to establish his rights. Also, at any time, the proprietor could require the Registrar to ‘warn off’ the caution. The claimant would be warned that unless he could justify his claim to an interest, the caution would be removed from the register. If he could justify the claim, the interest would receive permanent protection (e.g., by the entry of a notice).

#### Inhibitions

Inhibitions were used under the LRA 1925 to prevent dispositions being made in certain

defined circumstances. So, an inhibition would be used when a court injunction had been obtained to freeze the disposition of land, or on the insolvency of the proprietor to prevent any disposition which might be in breach of the insolvency laws.

### Cautions Against First Registration

The LRA 2002 limits the use of cautions against first registration as from 13 October 2003. They cannot be used if the applicant is the owner of the freehold or a lease for more than seven years in the land over which the right is being registered.

Prior to this limitation, registration of a caution against first registration would ensure that the landowner was notified of any purported dealing with the land and would be given an opportunity to defend his rights if a neighbour deliberately or inadvertently attempted to register the land as his own.

Whilst cautions registered to protect this type of interest prior to 13 October 2003 continue to be effective, they cannot be used on or after this date in relation to such interests. Instead, an application for first registration should be made to resolve the problem.

However, a caution against first registration can still be used to protect someone who has the benefit of an easement or profit and wants to ensure that it will be noted against the servient land if that is registered.

## Mistakes on the Register

Where there is a mistake on the register, it may be possible to seek rectification of the register. Compensation (indemnity) is payable where an error in the register is not rectified, where the register is rectified but loss is still suffered, where loss is suffered as a result of rectification or for any other error in the registration system
