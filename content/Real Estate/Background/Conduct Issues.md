# Conduct Issues

Summary of conduct issues most likely to be encountered in a conveyancing transaction.

## Acting for Seller and Buyer

> [!question]
> Can a solicitor act for both the buyer and seller in a conveyancing transaction?

Occasionally, the parties to a conveyancing transaction ask if one solicitor or one firm of solicitors can act for both parties. The parties usually request this as a way of saving duplication of time and expense.

### Basic Rule

para 6.2 SRA Codes, a solicitor or firm cannot act if the solicitor or firm has a conflict of interest or significant of such a conflict.

Recall [[Conflicts of Interest]]: a conflict of interest is ‘a situation where your separate duties to act in the best interests of two or more clients conflict’.

Whilst the SRA Codes do not prohibit acting for both buyer and seller, it is worth noting that guidance issued by the SRA notes this can give rise to a conflict of interest or a significant risk of one.

### Relevant Factors

Factors to take into account when determining whether a conflict of interest exists, or is likely to arise, include:

1. the complexity of the matter and length of the conveyancing chain involved.
2. the likelihood of negotiations having to take place. In higher value or complex transactions, there is a greater likelihood of substantial contract negotiations, increasing the risk of a conflict;
3. the bargaining power of the parties and any particular vulnerability of either party.

### Exceptions

If there is a conflict, or a significant risk of one, the solicitor or firm can only act for both parties if one of the two exceptions contained in para 6.2 applies.

- Under para 6.2(a), a solicitor can act for more than one party even if there is a conflict where the clients have a ‘substantially common interest’ in relation to a matter or a particular aspect of it and the conditions set out in para 6.2(i)–(iii) are satisfied.
	- According to the SRA Glossary, a ‘substantially common interest’ is a situation where there is a clear common purpose between the clients and a strong consensus on how it is to be achieved.
	- Law Society guidance issued in June 2020 states that this exception ‘does not apply to a property purchase. Although both clients have a common interest in completing the sale, they also have different interests, since one is buying and one is selling.’
- The other exception to the general prohibition in para 6.2 is contained in para 6.2(b) and applies when the clients are competing for the same objective.
	- This cannot apply to a seller and buyer in a conveyancing transaction as they are not competing for the same asset and therefore do not satisfy the definition of ‘competing for the same objective’.

> [!summary]
> So a solicitor or firm may only act for both parties in a conveyancing transaction in the rare instances where they are satisfied that there is no existing conflict of interest and no significant risk of a conflict arising in future, or there is a conflict of interest but the parties share a substantially common interest. This will be difficult to establish where the land or interest in land is being transferred for value.
> 
> Many solicitors and firms therefore take the view that it is best never to act for both buyer and seller in a property transaction, even where this could be justified under the SRA Codes.

### Steps to Take if You Act

If you do decide to act:

- Inform the clients in writing that should a conflict arise you will cease to act.
- Obtain client's consent to the firm acting
- Record the factors considered in reaching a decision.
- Ensure that each party is represented by a different fee earner.

If a decision is made to act under the ‘substantially common interest’ exception then the conditions in para 6.2(i)–(iii) must be complied with.

## Acting for Joint Buyers

It is usually acceptable to act for joint buyers. It may be necessary to advise residential buyers separately about their rights in property, particularly when they are not married/ in civil partnership.

## Acting for Borrower and Lender

As soon as the buyer’s solicitor receives instructions to act for the lender, they are effectively acting for both parties in one transaction (i.e., for both lender and borrower). They have two clients and owe a duty to both (see [[Mortgage Express v Bowerman & Partners (A Firm) [1996] 2 All ER 836]]). Acting for borrower and lender is possible unless, under para 6.2 of the SRA Codes, the solicitor or firm has a conflict of interest or a significant risk of a conflict.

> [!question] When might there be a conflict between a buyer and lender?
> 1. The terms of the mortgage offer are unfair to the borrower (e.g., an extortionate rate of interest is being charged);
> 2. Instructions reveal that the buyer would be in breach of one of the terms of the offer (e.g., by allowing tenants into possession of the property);
> 3. The buyer is unable to comply with the lender’s terms (e.g., to provide the balance of the purchase price from his own funds);
> 4. The mortgage documentation requires negotiation between the parties (but see below). 

Note that (4) is more finely balanced. In residential transactions, the borrower will often be borrowing from a high street bank or building society, where the mortgage is offered on standard terms and conditions. Arguably, there is either no conflict of interest or, if there is, there is a ‘substantially common interest’ under para 6.2 in that both the borrower and the lender want a good and marketable title to the property to be acquired.

> [!guid] Law Society guidance (June 2020)
> It may be acceptable to act for both borrower and lender where:
> 1. the mortgage is on standard terms, 
> 2. a significant part of the lender’s activities consists of lending, 
> 3. the mortgaged property is the borrower’s private residence and 
> 4. the certificate of title required by the lender is in the form approved by the Law Society and UK Finance.
> 
> The risk of conflict is high ‘if the mortgage is not a standard mortgage … of property to be used as the borrower’s private residence’.

Sometimes, the lender may ask the borrower’s solicitor to act for both the lender and the borrower on the title investigation and searches and enquiries but instruct its own solicitors to negotiate the loan documentation.

> [!warning]
> If a solicitor is aware that their buyer client is attempting to perpetrate a mortgage fraud, they must stop acting for that client immediately and their duty of confidentiality to the buyer client is discharged. 

## Acting for Joint Borrowers

Provided no conflict of interest exists or is likely to exist, there is no rule of law or conduct which prevents the same solicitor acting for joint borrowers. But there is the problem of potential [[Undue influence]].

The House of Lords, in the case of [[RBS v Etridge (No 2) [2002] 2 AC 773]] laid down detailed guidance for solicitors acting in such a situation.

> [!summary] Recall
> - The burden of proof that a landowner entered into a charge because of undue influence rests on the landowner.
> - Where there is a special relationship (parent and child; solicitor and client; but not husband and wife), there is a rebuttable presumption that there has been undue influence.
> - In the case of husband and wife, there is no such presumption. However, where a wife proposes to charge the matrimonial home as a security for a bank loan to her husband, or to a company through which he operates his business, a lender is put on enquiry because, prima facie, such transaction is not to the wife’s advantage.
> - Where the lender is put on such enquiry, it need do no more than take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the practical implications of the proposed transaction have been explained and understood. 
> - This usually involves hiring a solicitor to advise the wife. 

Solicitor should ensure to:

- Explain the nature of the documents and practical consequences of signing
- Warning of the seriousness of risks involves
- Explain wife has a choice
- Check whether wife wants the solicitor to write to the lender confirming that matters have been explained to her.

> [!question] What if the solicitor thinks the transaction is not in the best interests of the wife?
> - They should give reasoned advice to that effect.
> - Ultimately the decision is for the wife. 
> - The Etridge guidelines on what advice should be given and how it should be given must be followed, even where a wife insists on a very short meeting and appears determined to proceed regardless of the solicitor’s advice ([[Padden v Bevan Ashford Solicitors [2011] EWCA Civ 1616]]). 
> - If it is ‘glaringly obvious’ that the wife is being ‘grievously wronged’, the solicitor should decline to act.

If a solicitor or firm is satisfied that it can act under the SRA Codes, there is no rule

of law preventing one solicitor acting for both the husband and wife. The same principles will apply to civil partners or cohabitees.

## Contract Races

> [!defn]
> A contract race occurs when a seller enters into the conveyancing process with two or more prospective buyers at the same time. The buyers are competing with each other, and the winner of the race is the buyer who is ready to exchange contracts first.

### Disclosure

The Law Society practice note on Conflict of interests advises that it would be sensible to inform all buyers immediately of the seller’s intention to deal with more than one buyer, provided that the seller consents to the disclosure. Note that under the 2011 Code this used to be mandatory.

This is consistent with the solicitor's duties under the 2019 Code:

| Paragraph | Provision |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| para 1.2 | Solicitors must not abuse their position by taking unfair advantage of clients or others |
| para 1.4 | The solicitor and firm must not mislead others, either by their own acts or omissions or allowing or being complicit in the acts/ omissions of the seller. |

The solicitor must explain to the client that they are required to comply with the above paragraphs.

If the seller wants to proceed with the contract race, having obtained his client’s authority, the seller’s solicitor should disclose the seller’s decision to conduct a contract race direct to the solicitor acting for each prospective buyer, or, where no solicitor is acting, to the prospective buyer(s) in person.

> [!question] What if the seller refuses to allow the solicitor to notify all prospective buyers?
> If the seller refuses to allow the solicitor to notify all the prospective buyers of the contract race, the solicitor cannot disclose the contract race to the prospective buyers as they have a duty of confidentiality to their client under para 6.3. Instead, if they consider that paras 1.2 or 1.4 would be breached by the non-disclosure, they must decline to act to avoid breaching Principle 2 (acting with integrity).

In certain circumstances, it may be possible to act under the exception in para 6.2(b), as the clients have a conflict of interest but are competing for the same objective, particularly where the clients are sophisticated users of legal services and effective safeguards, such as information barriers, can be put in place, as this will make it more likely that the conditions in para 6.2(i)–(iii) have been complied with.

## Withdrawal of Papers

If the seller gets a better offer and withdraws acceptable of the first offer, this is not a contract race, since only one buyer is in possession of a draft contract at any one time.

## Undertakings

See [[Intro to Professional Practice/Professional Conduct and Regulation/Undertakings]].

> [!defn]
> An undertaking is a statement, made by a solicitor or their firm, that the solicitor or the firm will do something or cause something to be done, or refrain from doing something, given to someone who reasonably places reliance on it.

In conveyancing contexts where it is standard practice for a solicitor to give an undertaking, The Law Society has agreed standard wording for undertakings.

All the general rules on undertakings apply equally in the context of conveyancing. An undertaking must be performed within the agreed timescale or, in the absence of an agreed timescale, within a ‘reasonable amount of time’ (see para 1.3 of the SRA Codes).

Failure to honour an undertaking constitutes professional misconduct.

> [!warning]
> Unlike an undertaking given by an
> individual solicitor or a traditional partnership, an undertaking given by an incorporated law firm is not capable of being enforced under the court’s supervisory jurisdiction over solicitors as officers of the court ([[Harcus Sinclair v Your Lawyers [2021] UKSC 32]]). However, it may be enforceable as a contract (or deed), by an action for breach of trust or negligence or in professional disciplinary proceedings.

## Dealing with Non-solicitors

### Licensed Conveyancers

Licensed conveyancers are bound by rules made by the Council for Licensed Conveyancers which relate to conduct, discipline, insurance and accounts. These rules are similar to those which bind solicitors.

### Dealing with Unqualified Persons

The Legal Services Act 2007 makes it an offence to carry on reserved legal activities through an unqualified person, including preparing a contract, transfer or charge for the purposes of the Land Registration Act 2002. At the start of a transaction which apparently involves an unqualified person, the solicitor should write to the unqualified person asking for satisfactory evidence that no offence will be committed. The solicitor’s client should also be informed of the situation.

Undertakings should not be accepted from unqualified persons because there is no method of enforcing them.

### Acting for Lender

A solicitor acting for a lender where the borrower is represented by an unqualified person is under no obligation to undertake work which the buyer’s solicitor would normally carry out (e.g., drafting the transfer) and should not give the unqualified person additional assistance.

However, in such a situation, the solicitor must bear in mind that the interests of their lender client in obtaining a good title to the property are paramount.

### Buyer or Seller Not Represented at All

- The solicitor is under a duty in conduct to act in the best interests of their client (Principle 7), but also to act with integrity (Principle 5) and not to take unfair advantage of third parties (para 1.2 of the SRA Codes).
- Where two or more Principles come into conflict, the Introduction to the SRA Codes states that those which safeguard the wider public interest take precedence over an individual client’s interest.
- Maintain a balance between doing the best for the client and not taking advantage of an unrepresented opponent
- **Great care must be taken not to create a contractual relationship with the unrepresented opponent** (thereby putting the solicitor in breach of para 6.2 of the SRA Codes), or to become involved in possible breaches of the Legal Services Act 2007.
	- i.e., don't want to create a contract to be the opponent's solicitor implied through conduct

> [!guid]
> Where a transaction is over £5,000 in value and one of the parties is unrepresented, Land Registry requires a solicitor making certain applications (including applications to register a transfer or discharge a mortgage) to provide certified details and evidence of the unrepresented party’s identity.

## Money Laundering

See [[Money Laundering]].

> [!defn]
> Money laundering is the conversion, concealment or disguise of the
> proceeds of crime, so as to make it appear that they come from a legitimate source.

Firms must:

- Assess the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing
- Appoint a nominated officer
- Obtain verification of the identity of each of the firm's clients.

> [!guid]
> The Legal Sector Affinity Group, the anti-money laundering supervisors for the legal sector, issues guidance on anti-money laundering for the legal profession.

## Mortgage Fraud

Mortgage fraud occurs where individuals defraud a lender through the mortgage process.

> [!example]
> - The borrower overstates his income in order to obtain a higher mortgage,
> - A husband forges his wife’s signature
> - The price shown in the transfer is not the price actually paid by the buyer.

Potential consequences for a solicitor in acting/ continuing to act for a client committing mortgage fraud:

- Disciplining by SRA
- Criminal prosecution for having aided and abetted a fraud,
- Civil claim for negligence brought by the lender
- Proceeds of Crime Act 2002: a solicitor risks committing a money laundering offence if they enter into an arrangement with respect to or transfers the value of a mortgage obtained through fraud.

### Suspected Fraud and Confidentiality

The duty of confidentiality to the borrower is discharged only where the solicitor is satisfied of a strong prima facie case that the borrower is using them to further a fraud or other criminal purpose.

> [!guid]
> The Law Society suggests that this test may be satisfied if a client makes a deliberate misrepresentation on their mortgage application.

If the duty of confidentiality is not released, the solicitor should return the mortgage documents to the lender, stating only that they are ceasing to act due to professional reasons. In practice, this may result in the lender withdrawing its mortgage offer.

## Mortgage Fraud Practice Note

### Nature

Mortgage fraud occurs where individuals defraud a financial institution or private lender through the mortgage process.

Broadly consists of either:

- opportunistic action using misrepresentation of income or property value to obtain greater loans than a person is entitled to
- organised crime syndicates overvaluing properties, using false identities and failing to make any mortgage repayments.

A solicitor can be held criminally liable if their client commits mortgage fraud, because of the extended definition of fraud in Fraud Act 2006 and the anti-money laundering regime. False representations can be made explicitly or implicitly and may occur even where you know only that the representation might be misleading or untrue.

You risk committing a money laundering offence if you:

- acquire, use, have possession of, enter into an arrangement with respect to, or transfer this criminal property
- fail to report suspected money laundering.

### Methods

#### Opportunistic

Individuals can commit opportunistic mortgage fraud by providing untrue or misleading information, or failing to disclose required information. They will usually be evasive and dissuade you from conducting relevant checks.

#### Large-scale

More sophisticated, involves several properties. May be committed by criminal groups or individuals. Buy-to-let market particularly vulnerable.

1. Purchasers take out a mortgage without having any beneficial interest in the property;
2. Property value inflated;
3. Mortgage payments often not met;
4. Fraudster sells property back to themselves and take out mortgage at another bank;
5. Second mortgage inflated, first mortgage paid off at substantial profit.

May also use private sources of funding like property clubs, who have lower safeguards than institutional investors. Often offshore groups and different private companies are used. Fraudsters can 'flip' the property with back to back sales.

At least one professional will usually be at the core of the fraud. Mortgage lenders often rely on other professionals to verify the legitimacy of the transaction.

May be asked to complete a transaction where all the paperwork is already done.

Further, criminals can become involved in equity release schemes: sees homeowners receiving an offer from a third party to purchase the property while the homeowner can rent the property. The criminals will default on mortgage payments, and renting former homeowners will be evicted.

Application hijacking involves criminals intervening before completion, claiming they are the new representatives for the purchaser. They will often pose as solicitors or conveyancers.

After-the-event mortgaging is when criminals use dirty money to buy a property, and then seek external funding against the property. They then run off with the mortgage advance.

Or pose as a property developer, claim deceased estates.

Seek out properties unoccupied and boarded up, and apply to the County Court for a judgment against the owner for a non-existent debt. The property is sold to the person claiming the debt or one of their associates. Mortgage obtained over property → mortgage advance taken.

### Warning Signs

- Identity and ownership
	- Client located a long distance away
	- Client unusually uninterested in their purchase
	- Seller is a private company; check shareholders and directors etc.
	- Client does not usually engage in property investment of this scale
	- Client has limited knowledge of property
	- Credit history shorter than expected
	- Last minute change of representation
	- Unrelated parties paying fees
- Value of property
	- Property out of line with market in the area
	- Mortgage is for the full property value
	- Deposit paid for someone else
	- Recent transfer of land where no money has changed hands.

#### Mitigating Steps

1. Ask lots of questions if there are warning signs
2. Identify and verify the client.
	1. If concerned, double check a negative database (e.g., register of deaths or known fraudsters).
	2. If you don't meet clients, carry out enhanced due diligence in accordance with Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017.
3. Reliance (e.g., on another solicitor)
	1. Consider reliance provisions under Money Laundering regulations as potentially risky themselves.
	2. To avoid liability, check reputation and client due diligence material
4. Identify other solicitors and conveyancers
	1. Check them in a directory of their professional body:
		- [Find a Solicitor](http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/ "Find a Solicitor")
		- [Directory of Licensed Conveyancers](http://www.conveyancer.org.uk/CLC-Consumers/Find-a-Licensed-Conveyancer.aspx "Directory of Licensed Conveyancers")
	2. You should not transfer funds to the seller’s solicitors without contacting their firm and checking the accuracy of the account details you have been supplied with.
5. Consider all information on the retainer
	1. Does it all add up?
6. Ensure documents are fully completed
7. Ensure you only witness signatures you have physically witnessed.
8. Check for anything unusual in property value
9. Check changes to the retainer.

## Property and Title Fraud

Buyers’ solicitors should be aware of the Court of Appeal decision in [[P&P Property Ltd v Owen White [2018] EWCA Civ 1082]] and Catlin LLP Dreamvar (UK) Ltd v Mischon de Reya. Both cases were heard together, as they contained similar facts.

The Law Society has considered the implications of the case and published a new edition of its Code for Completion by Post. The Code expressly provides that the seller’s solicitor holds the purchase moneys on trust for the buyer and is under a fiduciary duty not to deal with that money other than in accordance with the terms of the Code. The seller’s solicitor also undertakes that they have authority from the true owner of the property to receive the money and that the person named as the owner in the contract is entitled to transfer the property to the buyer.

## Data Protection

- Lawyers must comply with GDPR.
- Some property transactions involve personal data.
- Property lawyers must consider whether they are a controller or processor for GDPR purposes and the legal basis for processing personal data.
