# Estates in land

## Land Ownership

All physical land in the country is owned by the Crown.

> [!defn]
> A proprietary right of possession is called an **estate** in the land.

There are two recognised legal estates: the freehold and the leasehold. These determine the length of time that rights to use and possess land can be enjoyed.

### Freehold Estate

The highest possible estate in land is the fee simple absolute in possession ([s 1(1) LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1)), more commonly referred to as the freehold estate. It is a right of possession lasting until the owner for the time being dies without heirs, meaning without any blood relatives and without having disposed of it by will.

| Fee           | Capable of being inherited                                                                         |
| Simple        | Can be inherited by any heir, including distant relatives.                                         |
| Absolute      | Estate is not liable to end prematurely, meaning it is not determinable or subject to a condition. |
| In possession | The fee simple owner has a current right to use and enjoyment of the property. Physical possession is not necessary, and includes receiving rent if the property is let to a tenant under lease.                                                                                                    |

> The fee simple absolute in possession freehold is the only one recognised at law, so ignore any references to other types. 

For practical purposes, the holder of the freehold in a piece of land is equivalent to the owner of any other property. This person is referred to as the landowner.

If the current owner dies without next of kin and without a will, the land is regarded as *bona vacantia* and the estate reverts to the Crown. This is incredibly rare.

Since freehold is a form of property, the owner of the freehold is free to sell it or give it away. Alternatively, they may grant away a lesser estate for a shorter period of possession than their own (a lease), to which their own estate will then be subject.

### Leasehold Estate

Where a freehold owner grants a lesser estate, which is of certain duration, the estate granted is a **term of years absolute** ([s 1(1)(b) LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1)), more commonly known as the leasehold estate, or just lease.

- 1/5 of UK population live in rented accommodation
- Leases granted in both residential and commercial contexts
- Can be short or very long

The leaseholder (tenant) may grant a lease of lesser duration out of their own leasehold, while still retaining the original lease.

```

This process may continue with sub-leases for shorter and shorter periods of possession. The residue of the estate after the granting of a lease is known as the **freehold reversion**. If the grantor holds a leasehold estate, the residue is known as the **leasehold reversion**. This means that when the lease ends, the right to physical possession of the land automatically reverts to the landlord.

### Hierarchy of Estates

Any piece of land may be subject to a hierarchy of estates (rights of possession).

The same piece of land may simultaneously be subject to a freehold, a lease and multiple sub-leases, with the holder of each owning the right to possession of the land, subject to any lesser rights they have granted for their slice of time.

> [!example]
> A person (F1) owns the freehold estate to their house. They have a right to possess it indefinitely.
> 
> F1 decides to move to Australia for 5 years on a work exchange programme. They do not want to sell the house so decide to grant a lease of the whole house for 5 years to a tenant (T1). This gives the tenant the right to possess the land for 5 years ie T1 holds a leasehold estate in the land. F1 still holds the freehold estate, which is said to be in reversion, but this piece of land is now subject to a leasehold estate too.
> 
> One year later T1 decides they no longer needs the top floor of the house. They grant a lease of the top floor only for 3 years to T2. T2 now also holds a leasehold estate in the top floor of the house, so of part of the land. As this lease to T2 is shorter than T1â€™s lease and granted by T1, it is described as an underlease or sub-lease. The terms are used interchangeably.
> 
> During the duration of the lease and sub-lease the piece of land can be described as being subject to the following estates in land:
> 
> - Freehold estate help by F1.
> - Leasehold estate held by T1.
> - Leasehold estate held by T2.
> 
> F1, T1 and T2 all enjoy a proprietary right in the same piece of land at the same time.

### Commonhold

Commonhold is a type of freehold introduced by the [Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/15/contents). It is not a new estate in the land, but one created out of a freehold registered estate.

It is designed to meet the needs of flats and other properties where the owners are interdependent of each other (e.g., retirement homes).

- Alternative to a long lease, which is a declining asset
- There is no overall landlord, just a freehold owner which is a company called a commonhold association.
- The owner of each flat is a member of the association.
- The association is responsible for maintaining communal areas.

This is very rare: fewer than 50 blocks of flats across England and Wales are commonhold properties.

## Transfer of Freehold Estate

Freehold estates are rarely created, generally they are transferred when an individual or business acquires a piece of land. Transfer of an estate is a legal process.

Transfer can happen by:

- Sale
- Will
- Gift
- Operation of law (automatic transfer in certain situations such as bankruptcy).

### Formalities

To transfer land, there are certain formalities. The degree of formality required to transfer land is generally much higher than for other forms of property. This process is called conveyancing.

### Sale of a Freehold

The usual method of transfer of a freehold estate is sale. This is a three stage process:

1. Exchange of contracts
2. Completion of the deed
3. Registration.

Note that the first state is voluntary and not legally necessary, though common in practice.

#### Pre-exchange

When an offer has been accepted and both the seller and buyer have agreed in principle to the sale and purchase, the buyer will normally make enquiries before committing to a purchase by the formal exchange of contracts. This will involve:

- Searching public registers and confirming that the seller actually owns the land;
- Finding out about any proprietary rights which benefit or burden the land.

#### Exchange of Contracts

This is the point at which the parties become legally committed to buying/ selling the land. The buyer usually pays a deposit at this stage.

Alongside the general rules of contract law, contracts for the sale of land require extra formalities. All land contracts must comply with [s 2 LP(MP)A 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/2) (Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act). This specifies that:

- The contract must be in writing
- It must contain all the expressly agreed terms
- It must be signed by both parties.

#### Completion of Deed

A legal estate must be transferred or created by deed ([s 52(1) LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/52)).

A deed is a written legal document. It is referred to as a **conveyance** in unregistered land or a **transfer** in registered land. Completion usually takes place some weeks after exchange of contracts, though it can take place immediately, in what is known as 'simultaneous exchange/ completion'.

The requirements of a valid deed are ([s 1 LP(MP)A 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/1)):

- A deed must be clear on the face of the document that it is **intended** to be a deed
	- Satisfied by labelling the document as a deed
- The deed must be validly **executed**
	- Where the grantor (seller) is an individual, the deed must be signed by the seller in the presence of a witness.
	- The witness needs to sign the deed to confirm that they have witnessed the signing of the deed by the individual entering into that deed. Described in statute as 'attesting' the signature.
	- There is no legal requirement for a buyer to sign the deed, but in practice both parties tend to execute the deed.
- The deed must be **delivered**.
	- This requires an acknowledgement that a person entering into a deed intends to be formally bound by its provisions. In practice, this takes place by dating the document, which the parties' solicitors will do.

A standard form of transfer deed is used, called a TR1. This is prescribed by the land registry.

Practically, the completion of the deed marks the point of completion when the buyer pays the balance of the purchase money to the seller, and the seller moves out of the property and hands the keys to the buyer.

If the land transferred is unregistered land, legal title passes at this point. The sale then triggers a requirement to register the land for the first time at the Land Registry ([ss 4-6 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/4)).

#### Registration

The completed deed is sent to the Land Registry. This is a national non-ministerial department which keep a register recording who owns each piece of land in England and Wales.

| Registered land                                                                                                                                    | Unregistered land |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| The legal title does not transfer until registration has taken place ([s 27(1) LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27)). | The legal title is transferred upon completion of the deed. The new owner must then register the land on the land register for the first time (first/ compulsory registration) within two months of completion, else the legal title will revert back to the seller ([ss 4-6 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/4)).                  |
