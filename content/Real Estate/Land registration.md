# Land Registration

## Introduction

If a piece of land is registered, it means the land has been registered at the Land Registry, a state institution in charge of administering the register. The register is a complete record of all matters relating to a piece of land (who owns it and the rights that benefit and burden it).

In unregistered land, the title information is contained in various old paper title deeds. This has several disadvantages:

- Difficult to discover third party interests, where documentation is held by the right-holder themselves
- Examining title deeds is necessary, which can be difficult. Some may be missing.
- No state guarantee of accuracy or compensation for error (unlike in the registered system).
- Slower and more expensive legal fees for purchaser. Repetitive process each time the land is sold.

### History

The **LRA 2002** governs the present system of registration.

The system was introduced in England and Wales by the Land Registration Act 1925 (now repealed), which envisaged that land would gradually be registered, region by region.

From 1926 onwards, central government designated various areas as being areas of compulsory registration, so eventually all of England and Wales would be registered. It was not until 1990 that all of England and Wales became designated as an area subject to **compulsory registration**.

Even now, you do not have to register an unregistered title – you only have to do this if there is a transaction or event (disposition) which triggers **compulsory registration**.

These transactions include sale, mortgage, gift, assent (if you’ve inherited land.)

The Land Registry estimates that approximately **15%** of land in England and Wales is not registered.

### Rationale

The aim behind the LRA 2002 was that:

> “…the register should be a complete and accurate reflection of the state of the title of the land at any given time, so that it is possible to investigate title to land online, with the absolute minimum of additional inquiries and inspections.”  
> (Paragraph 10, Explanatory Notes to the LRA 2002).

The system of registered land was therefore designed to **simplify** and **cut down** on the costs of conveyancing, while allowing for a **complete record** of all matters relating to a piece of land.

### Advantages of Registration

- Each registered title has a **title plan** which evidences the full extent of the property and usually also provides information as to who is responsible for the property’s boundaries.
- Once a person is registered as the title owner, that ownership is **guaranteed by the State**. Therefore, buyers are certain that the title to the land has been investigated and approved before registration, i.e., that the seller is the true owner and is in a position to sell the land to the buyer. If it is incorrect, then an innocent party who has suffered loss can make a claim for compensation against the Land Registry.
- Once a title is registered a copy of the registered title can be downloaded from the Land Registry’s website easily and quickly. This reduces the risk of [[fraud]] too.
- Once the title is registered all information is held centrally and can be viewed online. This **speeds up the conveyancing process** as a seller’s solicitor can deduce title and draft a contract for sale very quickly rather than have to wait for the original deeds and documents to be sent from the client (or the client’s lender).

Overriding interests are one of the greatest criticisms of the registered land system as they are interests which do not need to be registered, but will still be binding on a third party purchaser of the burdened land. They arguably defeat the rationale for Land Registration however, there are valid justifications for their existence.

## Registrable Titles

Titles which may be registered:

1. The freehold (i.e., the fee simple absolute in possession);
2. a lease that has more than seven years unexpired;
3. leases of any length where the right to possession is discontinuous (e.g., a time-share);
4. leases of any length granted to take effect in possession more than three months after the date of grant;
5. a rentcharge that is either perpetual or for a term of which more than seven years are unexpired;
6. a profit à prendre in gross (e.g., a fishing right) that is either perpetual or for a term of which more than seven years are unexpired;
7. a franchise (e.g., a right to hold a market) that is either perpetual or for a term of which more than seven years are unexpired.

## Compulsory Land Registration

Each time that unregistered land is sold for the first time since 1 December 1990 it must be registered. This is known as first registration (N.B. It has only been compulsory to register changes of ownership following death or gifts of land since 1 April 1998).

Under [s 4 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/4) (first registration) and [s 27 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27) (transactions involving already registered land) there are a number of circumstances which trigger compulsory registration: “triggering events.”

These triggering events apply to both unregistered and registered land. If the land is unregistered, the event triggers a requirement to register the land for the first time. If the land is already registered, the event triggers a requirement to update the register.

The [s 3 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/3) allows for voluntary registration of unregistered land, for example if the owner wants to obtain the advantages of the land registration system. The Land Registry offer reduced registration fees in these circumstances.

The ‘triggering events’ under LRA 2002 are:

1. a **transfer** of an unregistered **freehold** estate in land, including those:
	1. **for valuable or other consideration**,
	2. **by way of gift**,
	3. in pursuance of an order of any court,
	4. by means of an assent,
	5. by a deed appointing a new trustee;
2. a transfer of an unregistered **leasehold estate in land with more than seven years to run** at the time of the transfer;
3. a grant of a new leasehold estate in land:
	1. for a term of more than seven years, or
	2. for a term of any length to take effect in possession after a period of three months from the date of the grant;
4. a **first legal mortgage** of an unregistered freehold or leasehold. In the case of leasehold, this applies if, at the time of the mortgage, the lease has more than seven years unexpired.

These apply to both unregistered land (triggering a first registration requirement) and registered land (triggering a requirement to update the register).

Note that passing on land in a will is not a triggering event.

### Conveyancing Implications

If the title is not registered within two months of any of the above events, the disposition will become void as regards the legal estate, so legal title will revert back to the seller ([ss 4-6 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/4)). It is, however, possible to apply to the Registrar for an extension of this period.

#### Compulsory Registration History

- The requirements for compulsory registration have applied on a sale of the freehold to the whole of England and Wales since 1 December 1990
- It is only since 1 April 1998 that registration has become compulsory after a gift, the grant of a first legal mortgage or an assent
- Only since 13 October 2003 have leases with more than seven years unexpired have become registrable.
- It has only been compulsory to register following the appointment of a trustee by deed since 6 April 2009.

#### Practical Point

> [!warning]
> When buying unregistered land, it is therefore always necessary to check whether the title should already have been registered.
> 
> If it is discovered that the land should have been registered after some earlier disposition but has not been, the seller **must** be required to register the title before the transaction.

## Principles of Registration

The system of registered land is meant to simplify and cut down on the costs of conveyancing. Rather than look through complex paper title deeds, the register contains all matters that a registered title has the benefit of and all those matters which it is subject to.

This is based on the simple rule that **a buyer should be bound only by third party interests already entered on the register at the time of sale**, regardless of whether the interest is legal or equitable, and regardless of whether the buyer has actual knowledge of the interest.

### Purpose of Registration

 The buyer would always know precisely what it was buying, and the holder of the interest would always know that, by recording it on the register, the interest would be enforceable against a new owner. There are three principles:

 1. Mirror principle
 2. Curtain principle
 3. Insurance principle

### Mirror Principle 🪞

**The register should reflect all matters that the property has the benefit of and all the matters that the property is subject to**.

The register should be a clear and comprehensive account of the ownership and rights that benefit and burden a piece of land, and a purchaser should only need to look at the register to understand who owns a property and what third party rights will bind the property.

The transparent simplicity of the mirror principle for recording third party interests against an estate has never been fully realised due to the existence of overriding interests.

> [!defn]
> An **overriding interest** is an interest that does not appear on the register but will still be binding on the owner of the legal estate and any buyer of it. Their full title under the LRA 2002 is _'unregistered interests which override registered dispositions_’.

Overriding interests have attracted criticism since the system of land registration was first established in 1925. They are, nevertheless, retained by the LRA 2002, although their number has been vastly reduced.

The mirror principle is the ideal that the register should reflect all matters that the property has the benefit of and all the matters that the property is subject to. It should be a clear and comprehensive account of the ownership and rights that benefit and burden a piece of land. However, this has arguably never fully been realised due to the existence of 'overriding interests', which are interests that do not need registering and so do not appear on the register, but will still be binding.

### Curtain Principle 🎭

**The register records the ownership of the legal estate in the property**, the legal title.

If a property is held on trust, the purchasers need not be concerned in the beneficial or equitable ownership of the land (‘_what lies behind the curtain_’), which is often far more complicated than the legal ownership. This information is kept off the title.

This principle simplified land conveyancing, making the process of investigating ownership to a piece of land much simpler and quicker.

### Insurance Principle 📃

**The accuracy of the register is guaranteed by the state.**

This is one of the advantages of registered land over unregistered land. If there is an error with the register, it will be corrected and anyone who has suffered any loss will be compensated ([s 23 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/23)). You often see the compensation referred to as 'state indemnity'.

> [!note]
> Prior to 13 October 2003, a copy of the entries on the register was issued to the registered
> proprietor in the form of a land certificate. If there was a mortgage over the land, a charge
> certificate in similar form, but having the original mortgage deed attached, was issued instead to the lender, the land certificate being retained in the Registry. Land and charge certificates were abolished as from 13 October 2003 and existing certificates are no longer required on a subsequent registration. Land Registry now issues a Title Information Document (TID) to a registered proprietor, which contains a copy of the entries on the register. It is not admissible as evidence of ownership, though, and does not need to be produced on a subsequent
> disposition of the land.

## Registered Title

> [!defn]
> The Land Registry registered title documents are known as the **Official Copy.**

When a piece of land is registered for the first time, it is given a unique title number and the details of the landowner and rights that benefit/burden a piece of land are recorded.

The title plan the Land Registry creates for each property ensures that there is an accurate plan of the property.

### Devolution of Title

Once an estate in land becomes registered, all devolutions from that title must also follow the  
registered system. A separate title number identifies each estate in registered land, so that each separate estate in one physical parcel of land will have its own distinctive title number.

**The title number of an estate in registered land is its sole distinguishing feature and must be referred to in any dealing with that estate.**

The freehold/ leasehold title number will be cross-referenced on each respective title.

### Classes of Title

When a property is first registered, the Land Registry decides which class of title should be given to the property:

| Class of title | Description                                                                                                                                      | Prevalence    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Absolute       | **Best form of ownership** - the land is only bound by interests that are registered on the title or overriding interests.                       | Vast majority |
| Possessory     | Same as absolute title except third-party interests created before the date of first registration (and not on the title) will bind the property. | ~$1\%$        |
| Qualified      | **The title has some defect** which the Land Registry will then specify on the register.                                                         | Rare          |
| Good leasehold | Land Registry satisfied as to the title of the leaseholder only and not the freeholder.                                                          | Rare              |

#### Absolute Title

This is the **best form of ownership** and is really what you would want to see on the official copies if you were buying a property. Most properties are registered with this class of title.

The proprietor of an interest which is registered with an absolute title has vested in him the legal estate, together with all appurtenant rights, and only bound by interests that are registered on the title or overriding interests.

Specifically, subject to:

1. Entries on the register;
2. unregistered interests within Schs 1-3 LRA 2002;
3. where the proprietor is a trustee, minor interests (third-party rights) of which he has notice, for example the interests of the beneficiaries under the trust; and
4. where the land is leasehold, the express and implied covenants and obligations under the lease.

> [!danger] Absolute title $\neq$ perfect title
> 1. s 9(3) LRA 2002: Registrar has a discretion to overlook minor defects in the title and to grant an absolute title, so curing the defect.
> 2. The State guarantee takes effect subject to entries on the register which might make the land totally unsuitable for a client’s needs.
> 3. Land Registry often makes ‘non-guaranteed’ entries on an absolute title. 
> 	- The register might state that a particular deed ‘is expressed’ to have some effect. 
> 	- This means that Land Registry does not guarantee that it does have that effect.

#### Possessory Title

- Possessory title will be granted where the applicant is in possession of the land and, for example, he has lost his title deeds or is claiming title through adverse possession under the Limitation Act 1980.
- Although initially only a possessory title will be granted in these circumstances, it may be possible to upgrade the title to absolute after a period of time.
- Can be given to a freehold or leasehold.

#### Qualified Title

- Granted where the title submitted for registration shows a specific identified defect which the Registrar deems to be of such a nature that they cannot use their discretion to overlook the defect and grant an absolute title.
- The registration has the same effect as registration with an absolute title, except that the **State’s guarantee of the title does not apply to the specified defect.**
- Can be given to a freehold or leasehold.

> [!example]
> The title submitted for first registration showed that a transaction within the title had been carried out in breach of trust. In this situation, the proprietor would take his interest in the land subject to the interests (if any) of the beneficiaries under the trust.

#### Good Leasehold Title

- Applies only to leasehold estates.
- Awarded where the Registrar is satisfied that the title to the leasehold interest is sound but, having no access to the title to the superior reversionary interest, they are not prepared to guarantee the lease against defects in the freehold title, or to guarantee that the freeholder had the right to grant the lease.
- Such a title will therefore be given only where the title to the freehold reversion is unregistered, or where the freehold is registered with less than an absolute title.
- Regarded by lenders as unsatisfactory.

### Upgrading Title

| From           | To                                      | Conditions                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Possessory     | Absolute/ good leasehold (if leasehold) | Registrar satisfied as to title, or land has been registered with possessory title for $\geq 12$ years and Registrar satisfied that proprietor is in possession. |
| Qualified      | Absolute/ good leasehold (if leasehold) | Registrar satisfied as to title.                                                                                                                                 |
| Good leasehold | Absolute                                | Registrar satisfied as to reversionary freehold title and any intermediate leasehold title.                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Registers

### Property Register

This contains:

- A description of the property by reference to a filed plan and short description (e.g., address).
- The nature of the estate, i.e., whether it is freehold or leasehold.
- The details of any proprietary rights that benefit the land (e.g., [[Easements]], rights which benefit the land).
- Cross-references to superior and inferior titles where appropriate.
- Where the land is leasehold, brief details of the lease under which the land is held will be given on the property register.

> [!note] Boundary plan
> Although the right does exist for a landowner to have his boundaries determined by the Land Registry, this right is rarely used and the boundaries shown on the plan supplied by the Registry will give only a general indication of the position of the boundaries. Extraneous vidence (e.g., from pre-registration deeds) may be required to prove the exact position of boundaries.

### Proprietorship Register

Contains:

- The class of title which is registered.
- Names and addresses of registered proprietor(s).
	- It is possible for a proprietor to have up to three addresses for service noted on the register, one of which can be an e-mail address.
- Any restrictions on the owner(s) ability to deal with the land – such as a mortgage restriction preventing a sale without lender’s consent.
	- The register only details the ownership of the legal estate in the land, and beneficial interests under trusts are kept off the register.
- Any personal covenants given by the current registered proprietors can also be noted on the proprietorship register.
	- The most common situation where this occurs is when the current registered proprietors have entered into an indemnity covenant with the previous owner.
	- No obligation on the Land Registry to put indemnity covenants on the proprietorship register.
- Registration on/ after 1 April 2000:, the register will also normally include details of the price paid for the property by those proprietors.

### Charges Register

The charges register contains details of charges or encumbrances which currently affect the  
title:

- Easements and covenants
	- Often, easements and covenants binding the land will be noted and reference given to a schedule attached to the register.
	- **Only covenants which endure through a change of ownership of the land are noted on the charges register.**
	- The fact that a positive covenant is on the register does not make it binding; under normal land law rules, the burden of a positive covenant cannot run with the land even if it is on the register
- Mortgages
	- Two entries are recorded for each mortgage, the first stating the fact that the mortgage exists and the date on which it was created, the second showing the name and address of the proprietor of the charge, i.e., lender.
- Leases (except short leases, which bind as overriding interests).

With the exception of those deemed by the LRA 2002 to be 'overriding', only interests that have been correctly entered on the register will be enforceable against a purchaser.

### Keeping the Register Updated

[LRA 2002, s 27](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27) provides a list of transactions involving already registered land which must be registered i.e., the Land Registry must be notified of the transaction so that the register can be **updated accordingly.**

Failure to register means the transaction is **not legally recognised (LRA 2002, s 27(1))**.

> [!example]
> - The effect of this is that the buyer of a freehold estate is not recognised as the new legal owner until registration has taken place;
> - The tenant of a lease over 7 years is not recognised as having a legal lease until the lease is registered
> - A legal mortgage is not created until it has been registered at the Land Registry

This ensures the register is an **accurate reflection of a piece of land** at any one time and kept up to date.
