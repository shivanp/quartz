# Property Taxation

## VAT

Value added tax is chargeable in respect of a supply of goods or services made in the course of a business.

- Supplies can be exempt, zero-rated or standard-rated depending upon the circumstances.
- Standard-rated supplies are subject to VAT at the current standard rate; zero-rated supplies are taxable, but, as the name suggests, are subject to VAT at 0%. Exempt supplies are not subject to tax.
- The current standard rate of VAT is 20%.

### Recovery

Value added tax paid by a business on supplies made to it (‘input tax’) can be recovered from HMRC, provided that it was incurred in making taxable (i.e., standard-rated or zero-rated, but not exempt) supplies.

In practice, the input tax incurred in making those supplies is deducted from the output tax and only the balance is paid over to HMRC. Deducting the input tax is colloquially referred to as ‘recovering the VAT’.

Residential properties:

| Transaction | VAT status |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Sale of a green field site | Exempt, but subject to option to tax. |
| Construction and civil engineering works | Zero-rated |
| Legal and other professional services | Standard-rated |
| Sale or lease of a new house | Zero-rated. |

Commercial properties:

| Transaction | VAT status |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Sale of a green field site | Exempt, but subject to option to tax |
| Construction and civil engineering works | Standard-rated |
| Legal and other professional services | Standard-rated |
| Sale or lease of a new freehold building | Standard-rated |
| Sale or lease of an old freehold building | Exempt, but subject to option to tax |
| Grant or assignment of a lease | Exempt, but subject to option to tax |

## Option to Tax

When an exempt supply is made, any input tax incurred in connection with that supply cannot be recovered from HMRC. The purpose of the option to tax is to enable an individual to convert an exempt supply into a taxable one, enabling him to recover any input tax incurred.

Notification of the option to HMRC is necessary for it to be effective.

> [!note]
> If the option to tax is exercised, tax is chargeable at standard rate. 

### Residential Properties

- The sale or lease of a new house by the person constructing it is zero-rated.
- The subsequent sale of a dwelling (either freehold or leasehold) by a private individual will not be made in the course of a business.
- The sale of a buy-to-let property is an exempt supply.

So in none of these cases will the seller be charging the buyer VAT in addition to the purchase price.

In the case of residential development, the purchase of land by a developer will be an exempt supply, unless the seller has opted to charge tax. The construction work will be zero-rated and so no input tax will be incurred on this, but input tax will be paid on the professional fees. The sale of the houses will be zero-rated and, as this is a taxable supply (albeit at 0%), the developer will be able to recover the input tax incurred from HMRC.

### Commercial Properties

- The sale of a ‘new’ freehold commercial building is standard-rated,
	- Enables a developer to recover the potentially significant amounts of input tax incurred in developing the site.
	- For these purposes, a ‘new’ building is one completed within the three years prior to the sale.
	- Further, although the purchase of land in the first place will prima facie have been an exempt supply, the seller to the developer might have opted to charge tax.
- The freehold sale of a commercial property which is more than three years old and the grant of a lease of commercial property (whatever the age of the building) are exempt, but subject to the option to tax.
- VAT may have been incurred in carrying out repair and refurbishment works on the building, and as this cannot be recovered on making an exempt supply, the seller/landlord can opt to tax and recover his input tax by setting it off against the output tax being charged to the buyer/tenant.

#### TOGC

Where the property is a ‘new’ freehold or ‘old’ property where the option to tax has been exercised (so that the standard rate would normally apply), if the property is let and the buyer intends to continue the letting business, it may be possible to treat the sale of the property as a transfer of a business as a going concern (TOGC).

If the transaction is a TOGC, no VAT will be chargeable on the transaction. The seller and buyer must both be VAT registered, and the buyer must opt to tax the property and notify HMRC prior to the tax point for the transaction.

#### VAT Sensitivity

Potential buyers and tenants who make mainly standard-rated or zero-rated supplies in the course of their businesses (e.g., retail food stores or solicitors) will not be adversely affected by a charge to VAT on the purchase price or rent, since they will be able to recover the VAT. They will do this either by offsetting the input tax against their output tax (in the case of those making standard-rated supplies) or by reclaiming it from HMRC (in the case of those making zero-rated supplies). However, for those businesses that make only exempt supplies (e.g., banks, building societies, insurance companies), any VAT they pay on the purchase price or the rent will be irrecoverable.

#### Conveyancing Points

If VAT is chargeable in a property transaction, it is necessary to ensure that the documentation deals with it adequately. Under general principles, a price is deemed to be inclusive of VAT unless the contrary is stated.

#### New Commercial Freehold

- Sale of new commercial freehold standard rated
- Seller needs to ensure contract allows him to charge VAT as well as agreed purchase price.
- Will usually either incorporate Standard Conditions (SC) or Standard Commercial Property Conditions (SCPC)
	- SC 1.4.1: the price is inclusive of VAT
	- SCPC 2: VAT at the standard rate will be payable by the buyer (so make the buyer aware of this).

#### Old Commercial Freehold

Seller has the option to tax. If the option to tax is exercised, see above for impact of standard conditions.

> [!action]
> The buyer should be warned of the dangers of the seller opting to tax prior to completion in respect of an old commercial building. Consider:
> 1. Incorporating condition A1 in Part 2 of SCPCs.
> 	-  Provides that the sale does not constitute a supply for VAT purposes and the seller will not opt to tax. 
> 	- Exception: A1.3: if there is a change in law between exchange and completion that makes the sale of the property a VATable supply, the buyer will have to pay VAT. 
> 2. Incorporating a special condition that disapplies SCPC 2 and provides that the purchase price is inclusive of VAT. 
> 	- Eliminates the risk of the exception above
> 	- But seller may not agree. 

#### Commercial Lease

The grant of a commercial lease is an exempt supply subject to the **option to tax**. If the option is made after the grant of the lease, s 89 VATA 1994 allows the rent to be increased by the amount of VAT, unless there is a clause making the rent inclusive of VAT. If an election is made before the grant of the lease, s 89 will not apply. So include the clause.

#### Seller/ Landlord Cannot Add VAT

If the option to tax is made and the seller/ landlord is unable to charge VAT in addition to the agreed price, the seller is still liable to account to HMRC for VAT on the sale.

## SDLT

SDLT replaced stamp duty from 01/12/03. Charged on property transactions, at different rates depending on the type of property and value of transaction. Payable to HMRC within 14 days of completion. In Wales, SDLT replaced with Land Transaction Tax (LTT).
