# Common Title Problems

## Trustees of Land

In registered land, a restriction may be entered on the proprietorship register which will indicate to the buyer what must be done to overreach the beneficiaries’ interests. Provided the terms of the restriction are complied with, the buyer will get good title. In all cases, the disposition must be made by all the trustees, being at least two in number, or a trust corporation.

### Appointing Further Trustee

- If there is only one trustee then the buyer must insist that a second trustee is appointed in order to overreach the interests of the beneficiaries (see [[Overreaching]]).
- The appointment will usually be made by the surviving trustee (although the trust deed can confer the power of appointment on someone else).

#### Options

1. The appointment can be made prior to the contract for sale being entered into.
	- The new trustee will thus be a party to the contract and bound by its terms.
	- Particularly useful where the new trustee is also in occupation of the property.
2. The sole trustee can enter into the contract on his own and then appoint a further trustee prior to completion, to receive the purchase price and thus ensure overreaching takes place.
	- A special condition can be included in the contract requiring the seller to appoint the further trustee
	- Note, the seller would be under an obligation to do so anyway in order to comply with the duty to make good title.

### Conveyance by Trustees to Themselves

```ad-action
In the case of a disposal by trustees or personal representatives to one of themselves, enquiry must be made into the circumstances of the transaction because, on the face of it, such a disposal is in breach of trust and is voidable by the beneficiaries.
```

#### Exceptions

1. there is proof of a pre-existing contract in favour of the trustee or personal representative;
2. the personal representative was a beneficiary under the will or intestacy of the deceased;
3. the consent of all the legally competent (i.e., adult and sane) beneficiaries was obtained to the transaction;
4. the conveyance was made under an order of the court;
5. the transaction was sanctioned by the trust instrument.

## Personal Representatives

Personal representatives enjoy the same wide powers as trustees of land.

| Number of personal representatives | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1$                                | Has all the powers of two or more personal representatives, and consequently (unlike a sole individual trustee) can convey the land on her own and give a valid receipt for the proceeds of sale. |
| $>1$                               | All personal representatives must join in the assent or conveyance.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

```ad-action
A buyer must therefore call for the grant to see who has or have been appointed as personal representative(s), and must insist that all the personal representatives named in the grant join in the assent or conveyance, or call for evidence of the death of any personal representative who will not be a party to it.
```

### Registering as Proprietors

- On production of the grant of probate, personal representatives **may** become registered as proprietors of the land
	- Buyer purchases registered land as normal.
	- Rare, unless holding property for some time (e.g., for a minor)
- Grant of probate is proof of PR's authority to deal with the land.
	- Buyer takes a transfer from all the proving personal representatives and submits an office copy or certified copy of the grant with his application for registration to obtain a good title.
	- An assent made by personal representatives to a beneficiary must be in the form prescribed under the Land Registration Rules 2003 (SI 2003/1417).

## Co-ownership

See [[Co-ownership]]. Practical points:

### Tenants in Common

Restriction entered on proprietorship register:

> “No disposition by a sole proprietor of the registered estate (except a trust corporation) under which capital money arises is to be registered unless authorised by an order of the court.”

If in the death of one or more co-owners there is only one surviving trustee (and you have death certificates to prove), two options:

1. Comply with the restriction, which ensures a second trustee is appointed to join with the survivor in the transfer. Preferred and safest way.
2. Have the restriction removed because the seller can prove they are solely and beneficially entitled to the whole legal and equitable interest in the land.

### Joint Tenants

If the co-owners are joint tenants in equity, **no restriction is placed on the register** and a buyer may generally deal safely with the survivor alone on proof of the death of the deceased co-owner.

It is possible that the equitable joint tenancy could have been severed, but in the absence of a restriction, only if the beneficiary of the deceased has an overriding interest under the LRA 2002 by virtue of being in occupation of the property will a problem arise. Conduct searches and enquiries to check.

## Disposing Lenders

See [[Mortgages]].

s 101 LPA 1925: gives a power to sell the legal estate vested in the borrower, subject to prior incumbrances but discharged from subsequent ones, to every lender whose mortgage is made by deed (unless explicitly excluded).

Only the proprietor of a registered charge has a power of sale. When a property is sold by a lender, the buyer takes the property free from that and any other (secondary) mortgages.

### Power of Sale

#### Arises

 [LPA 1925, s 101(1)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/101): The power of sale arises when the mortgage money becomes due under the mortgage, i.e., on the legal date for redemption (usually early).

#### Exercisable

The power becomes exercisable by the lender only as provided for in the mortgage deed, or when one of the events specified in [s 103 LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/103) has occurred. These events are:

1. a demand has been made for the principal sum outstanding on the mortgage and this demand is unpaid for three months; or
2. any interest due under the mortgage is in arrears for two months; or
3. there is breach of any other covenant in the mortgage.

## Discharged Mortgages

- A mortgage over registered land which has been discharged will be deleted from the charges register of the title and is thus of no further concern to the buyer.
- As far as the seller’s existing mortgage is concerned, the buyer should raise a requisition requiring this to be removed on or before completion.
- Discharge of a mortgage of registered land is effected by filing a completed Form DS1 at Land Registry or by use of the ED or e-DS1 system.

## Attorneys

### Powers of Attorney

```ad-defn
A power of attorney is a deed under which the donor appoints someone (the attorney or donee) to carry out certain actions on their behalf.
```

### Types of Power

| Power          | Description                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General power  | s 10 of the Powers of Attorney Act 1971: entitles the attorney to deal with all of the donor’s assets |
| Special power  | Permits the attorney to deal only with certain specified assets or categories of assets               |
| Trustee power  | Used where property is held on trust                                                                                                      |
| Enduring power | Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985: endures through the donor's mental incapacity                   |
| Lasting power  | Replaced enduring power (01/10/2007)                                                                  |

### Revocation

Power of attorney may be revoked expressly by the donor, or will be revoked automatically on the donor’s death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy. Once registered, enduring powers are irrevocable except by order of the court.

A person who buys from an attorney (and subsequent buyers) will get good title if the power:

1. authorises the transaction which is to take place between the attorney and the buyer; and
2. is valid and subsisting at the date of completion of the transaction.

### Buyer Protection

The buyer is given protection through the Powers of Attorney Act 1971:

#### Copy of Power

Buyer entitled to a certified copy of the power of attorney affecting the title–Land Registry will require a copy before registering a disposition. Buyer should check terms of the power to ensure the transaction was authorised.

#### General, Special and Trustee Powers

A person who deals with an attorney holding these types of powers of attorney will take good title, provided he acquires in good faith without knowledge of the revocation of the power:

```ad-statute
title: s 5(2) Powers of Attorney Act 1971
Where a power of attorney has been revoked and a person, without knowledge of the revocation, deals with the donee of the power, the transaction between them shall, in favour of that person, be as valid as if the power had then been in existence.
```

Death revokes such a power.

```ad-statute
title: s 5(4) Powers of Attorney Act 1971
Where the interest of a purchaser depends on whether a transaction between the donee of a power of attorney and another person was valid by virtue of subsection (2) of this section, it shall be conclusively presumed in favour of the purchaser that that person did not at the material time know of the revocation of the power if—
- (a) the transaction between that person and the donee was completed within twelve months of the date on which the power came into operation; or
- (b) that person makes a statutory declaration, before or within three months after the completion of the purchase, that he did not at the material time know of the revocation of the power.
```

#### Enduring Powers

```ad-defn
An enduring power of attorney is one made under the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985. This Act has been repealed and enduring powers are now governed by provisions contained in Sch 4 to the Mental Capacity Act 2005. 
```

Until the incapacity of the donor, the power takes effect as an ordinary power and the Mental Capacity Act contains provisions to protect buyers which are similar to those outlined above. On the incapacity of the donor, the attorney’s authority to act becomes limited to such acts as are necessary for the protection of the donor and his estate until such time as the power is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian.

```ad-action
Where a person is buying from an attorney who holds an enduring power, he should make a search at the Office of the Public Guardian to ensure that no application for registration of the power is pending. If an application is pending, this would suggest mental incapacity on the part of the donor.
```

#### Lasting Powers

```ad-defn
The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (in force 1 October 2007) replaced enduring powers with a new form of power called a lasting power. Lasting powers give an attorney power to deal with the donor’s personal welfare and/or his property and affairs, including authority to deal with such matters when the donor no longer has capacity.
```

The lasting power is required to be in a prescribed form but, unlike enduring powers, comes into effect only when registered with the Office of the Public Guardian.

```ad-action
Where the buyer is buying from an attorney who holds a lasting power, he should obtain an office copy of the power from the Office of the Public Guardian as evidence that the lasting power is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian and to check that the attorney is acting within the scope of his authority.

The buyer from the attorney will be protected unless he knew the power was invalid (by s 14(3) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005) or was aware of circumstances which would have terminated the attorney’s authority to act (by s 5(2) of the Powers of Attorney Act 1971).
```

#### Trustees

```ad-guid
If one of two co-owners wishes to appoint an attorney to execute a deed selling the land, the co-trustee cannot be appointed, as such co-trustee will not be able to give a valid receipt. In such a case, a stranger will need to be appointed, and this rule cannot be evaded by using an enduring power.
```

## Transactions at an Undervalue

```ad-warning
Where in the chain of title there is a transaction for no consideration or at an undervalue, care needs to be exercised, since the transaction could be set aside under the Insolvency Act 1986.
```

| Party      | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Statute       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Individual | A transaction at an undervalue by an individual within the five years immediately preceding the current transaction may be set aside by the trustee in bankruptcy if the donor is made bankrupt          | s 339 IA 1986 |
| Company    | If a transaction at an undervalue was made by a company within the two years preceding the date of the current transaction, it may be set aside by the liquidator on the company’s subsequent insolvency | s 238 IA 1986              |

### By a Company

![[Business Law and Practice/Insolvency/Voidable Transactions#Transactions by a company at an undervalue TUV]]

### Buyer Defences

```ad-note
The basic principle is that a subsequent buyer is protected, provided that he has acquired in good faith and for value from a person other than the insolvent company or bankrupt individual (Insolvency Act 1986, s 241(2)(a) and s 342(2)(a)).
```

See [[Business Law and Practice/Insolvency/Voidable Transactions#Sanctions]] above for details on presumption of good faith. Remember, [[connected person]] includes directors, shadow directors and associates. [[Associate]] defined widely in s 435 IA 1986 to include a person’s spouse or ex-spouse, members of his family and his spouse’s family, his partner and his partner’s family, and his employees.

```ad-action
- Registration of bankruptcy proceedings will amount to notice, so a buyer will need to make a bankruptcy search against the individual making the transaction at an undervalue not for the period of that person’s ownership, but for a period of five years from the date of the transaction at an undervalue.
- In the case of companies, the relevant time is 2 years. 
```

### Registered Land

In the case of dispositions registered on or after 1 April 2000, the register includes details of the price paid by the proprietor.

```ad-action
If this appears to be nil or something of low monetary value, the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 should be borne in mind. 
```

Where first registration is based on a transaction at an undervalue, a note will be added in the proprietorship register to the effect that the title is subject to the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986.

Some lenders are reluctant to lend on property where there has been a transaction at an undervalue within the past two years (companies) or five years (individuals), unless an **insurance** policy is obtained covering the possibility of the donor’s insolvency within these periods.

## Restrictive Covenants

Instructions may reveal that the buyer’s intended use of the property after completion will cause a breach of existing covenants.

1. Check whether the covenant is registered (usually is)
2. Look at the wording of the covenant to see whether it has been annexed to the land and is prima facie binding.
3. Consider whether it is possible to obtain an insurance policy to cover liability for future breaches of covenant. Insurance company will need details of the covenant, local area, any steps taken etc.

![[Freehold covenants#Ending Freehold Covenants]]

### Insurance

If a policy is issued, it is normally a single premium policy (a single sum is paid on the issue of the policy). The benefit of the policy may be passed on to successors in title. The buyer’s lender should be consulted about the proposed breach of covenant and his approval obtained to the terms of the insurance policy.

```ad-danger
In arranging or advising on such a policy, the solicitor is carrying out a ‘regulated activity’ for the purposes of the FSMA 2000. Ensure you fall within the professional firms exemption to avoid committing a criminal offence.
```

### Other Methods

To be used only if insurance is not possible.

- Approach the person with the benefit of the covenant.
	- Often they may accept payment for release from the covenant.
	- But there might be multiple parties with the benefit of the covenant
	- By putting the benefitting party on notice, makes it almost impossible to get insurance.
- Apply to Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber)
	- Has power in certain circumstances under the LPA 1925, s 84 to grant a modification or discharge of a restrictive covenant.

### Competition Legislation

#### Competition Act 1998

- This prohibits any agreement which may affect trade within the UK and which prevents, restricts or distorts competition within the UK.
- Since April 2011 this prohibition has applied to land agreements, which include transfers of freehold and leasehold interests together with leases themselves.
- It only applies to agreements between businesses
- It is retrospective, thus the date of the covenant is irrelevant.
- It is not possible to exclude the Act.

#### Prohibited Restrictions

Unless the covenant has an ‘appreciable effect’ on the market affected by the  
agreement, it will not fall within the competition legislation. Whether such provisions have an appreciable effect depends on a number of factors, including the scope of the relevant market and the degree of market power of the parties.

#### Consequences

- Fines of up to 10% of a firm’s worldwide turnover
- Agreement containing a prohibited restriction void and unenforceable (though a court may consider it possible to sever the prohibited restriction and let other terms of the agreement remain valid).

#### Groceries

Certain land agreements in connection with grocery retailing activities are subject to  
additional control under the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the ‘Controlled Land Order’).

## Positive Covenants

The burden (the obligation to observe a covenant) does not generally bind successors in title of freehold land where a covenant is positive in nature. There is one anomalous exception to this principle, a fencing "easement".

A positive covenant may be enforced at law even though the covenantor owns no estate of any kind in land. The common law only requires that the covenantee must hold an estate in land to which the benefit of an enforceable covenant can accrue.

Although the burden of a positive covenant does not run with the land, there are various workarounds which can be adopted to ensure a similar outcome.

### Passing Burden

- Chain of indemnity
	- Although a positive obligation is not directly enforceable against a successor in title, it may be indirectly enforceable through indemnities given by a buyer to the previous owner.
	- But chain only as strong as its weakest link
	- Only damages can be obtained, not injunction etc.
- Compulsory renewed covenants supported with a restriction
	- Most common way of making the burden of positive covenants run.
	- The transferee gives a binding obligation to compel its own successor to:
		- Enter into a direct covenant with the dominant owner at the date of the new covenant, in the same terms as the initial positive covenant.
		- Impose a further obligation to provide a direct covenant in similar terms on its successor.
	- Risk: the covenantor could transfer the land without complying with its obligation to obtain a further covenant from the transferee. Breach of contract remedies will be inadequate.
	- Common practice to ensure compliance by adding an appropriately worded restriction on the servient landowner's title: “no disposition of the land in that title should be registered without a certificate signed by a conveyancer confirming that the requirement to provide a new deed of covenant has been met”.
	- But inappropriate where lots of people benefit from the covenants, in particular where there are numerous plots of dominant land.
- Right of entry annexed to an estate rentcharge
	- To secure the performance of positive covenants, the owner of the land may reserve a rentcharge to which it annexes a right of entry.
	- A rentcharge is “any annual or other periodic sum of money charged on or issuing out of land”, otherwise than under a lease or mortgage".
	- An estate rentcharge can be used to enforce a positive obligation, because the chargor takes a legal right of entry (i.e., possession) in the event of default.
	- The right of entry may be exercised not only for failure to pay the rentcharge, but also for breach of the covenant, subject to the court providing relief against forfeiture.
	- Draconian for buyers
	- The rentcharge may be for a nominal amount and serves as a peg on which to hang the enforcement of the covenant.
- Benefit and burden rule
	- See ![[Freehold covenants#Mutual Benefit and Burden]].
	- So be careful about relying on [[Halsall v Brizell [1957] Ch 169]] in practice: there is a risk the courts will not recognise a condition precedent to an obligation to repair/ maintain something.
- Freehold right of re-entry
	- The seller transfers the property to the buyer, but retains an express (equitable) right of re-entry, under which the property will revert to the seller if the positive covenant is not performed.
	- As the right of re-entry is an equitable interest, it should be protected by a notice registered against the buyer's title to the property.
	- Draconian and rarely used in practice.
	- May make borrowing problematic
- Use of leasehold title
	- The burden of a positive covenant may run with a leasehold estate.
	- s 153 LPA 1925: grants a right to enfranchise (expressed as a right to enlarge the term of the lease into a fee simple).
	- Where a lease may be enlarged into a freehold, section 153 provides that it will be subject to the same covenants, obligations and provisions which burdened the lease.
	- Untested, complicated.

### Passing Benefit

![[Freehold covenants#Common Law Rules Benefit]]

### Drafting Transfer

Best practice to refer to all the positive covenants together in one of the following ways:

1. "the Transferee covenants with the Transferor, for the benefit of the Transferor's Retained Land and each and every part of it, with the intention of binding the Property and each and every part of it, to comply with the covenants set out in the sub-clauses."
2. "the Transferee covenants with the Transferor, for the benefit of the Transferor's Retained Land and each and every part of it, with the intention of binding the Property and each and every part of it, to comply with the covenants set out in Schedule [NUMBER]."

## Execution of Deeds

Check deeds are properly executed.

In the case of registered land, title is updated by Land Registry whenever there is a dealing in respect of that title. As part of this process, Land Registry will scrutinise the execution of the document giving effect to that dealing before recording its effect on the register.

### By an Individual

#### New Rule

The formalities for execution of a deed changed on 31 July 1990. For deeds executed on or after 31 July 1990, the following rules apply ([s 1 LP(MP)A 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/1)):

1. A deed must be clear on the face of the document that it is **intended** to be a deed
	- Satisfied by labelling the document as a deed
2. The deed must be validly **executed**
	- Where the grantor (seller) is an individual, the deed must be signed by the seller in the presence of a witness.
	- The witness needs to sign the deed to confirm that they have witnessed the signing of the deed by the individual entering into that deed. Described in statute as 'attesting' the signature.
	- There is no legal requirement for a buyer to sign the deed, but in practice both parties tend to execute the deed.
3. The deed must be **delivered**.
	- This requires an acknowledgement that a person entering into a deed intends to be formally bound by its provisions. In practice, this takes place by dating the document, which the parties' solicitors will do.

It is possible for an individual to direct another person to sign a deed on his behalf, provided that the  
signature is made in his presence and there are two attesting witnesses.

#### Old Rule

The document had to be signed and sealed by its maker, and delivered as his deed. The seal was usually only a red, self-adhesive circular piece of paper. The delivery of the deed was a matter of intention.

### By a Company

In the case of deeds executed by a company on or after 31 July 1990, a document can be executed in one of three ways:

1. By the affixing of the company seal.
	- It must be clear on the face of the document that is intended to be a deed.
	- If this method of execution is used, the document is deemed, in favour of a purchaser, to have been duly executed, provided that the seal purports to have been affixed in the presence of and attested by two members of the board of directors or a director and the secretary.
2. By being signed by a director and the secretary, or by two directors of the company, provided that the document is expressed to be executed by the company.
3. A deed can be executed by being signed by a single director in the presence of a witness who then attests that signature (on/after 06/04/2008 only).

```ad-warning
Must say 'executed as a deed', 'signed as a deed' is not acceptable.
```

Must also be delivered as a deed.
