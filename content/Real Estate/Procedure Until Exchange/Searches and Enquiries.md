# Searches and Enquiries

## Reasons

- Caveat emptor
- When drafting the contract, the seller has only very limited duties to disclose matters affecting title to the property.
- Buyer's solicitor must take steps to ensure the suitability of the property.
- Failure can give rise to liability in negligence, if the buyer subsequently suffers loss ([[Cooper v Stephenson (1852) 21 LJQB 292]])
- Buyer must be fully advised of the information discovered and its implications for the proposed purchase.

## Who

Buyer must make all necessary pre-conduct searches. Lender's Handbook requires that all searches be $\leq 6$ months old at the date of completion.

## How

Many searches can be undertaken electronically. Searches with the local authority can take several weeks.

## What

Standard in every transaction:

- Search of local land charges register
- Enquiry of local authority
- Pre-contract enquiries of seller
- Water and drainage enquiries
- Environmental search
- Personal inspection.

Additional searches:

- Chancel repair search
- Index map search
- Land Charges Department search against seller's name/ previous owners' names for unregistered land.
- Company search
- Flood search
- Location specific searches
- Survey reports.

## Local Land Charges Search

```ad-defn
title: Local land charges
Financial charges or restrictions on land imposed by public authorities under statute. 
```

Essential to search this in every transaction. It will be necessary to search either a register maintained by the local authority or the land registry, depending on the area. A fee is payable for an official search.

Search result is given by way of certificate, digitally signed by an officer of the council/ Land Registry (LR taking over slowly under Infrastructure Act 2015). A fee is payable for copies of documents.

The search will reveal any entries kept under statutory obligations. Might overlap with information from Form CON29, but should still do both to complete due diligence.

### Examples

```ad-example
title: Matters revealed by local land charges
- Financial charges
- Tree preservation orders
- Smoke control orders
- Compulsory purchase orders
- Planning permission granted
- Restrictions on permitted development
- Orders revoking/ modifying planning permissions. 
- Conservation area designation orders
- Listed building status. 
```

For each, consider:

1. Significance
2. How it affects buyer's intended use of building.

### Liability

Where a person suffers as a result of an error in an official certificate of search, compensation may be payable under s 10 of the Local Land Charges Act 1975.

## Enquiries of Local Authority

- Submit Form CON29 to the appropriate authority (district/ London council).
	- CON29 relevant to every transaction.
- CON29O more specialised in nature.
	- Consider whether needed.

CON29 will reveal:

- Any planning permissions granted/ refused / pending
- Whether roads are public.
- Any public paths or right of way
- Any new roads or railways proposed near building.
- Any proposals for permanently stopping up roads or footpaths.
- Any proceedings for breach of building regulations
- Any proposed compulsory purchase orders.
- Any notice served of contaminated land.
- Radon gas
- Whether a property is of community value.

CON29O:

- Special designation area
- Environmental/ pollution notices
- Registration of common land/ village green.

### Liability

Subject to the validity of the exclusion clause printed on the front sheet of the search  
application form, a local authority could be sued in negligence for an erroneous reply to the  
printed enquiries.

### Forms LLC1 Vs CON29/O

| Form    | Extent                                                                                   | Liability                                        | Information revealed                                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LLC1    | Will only reveal matters falling within the statutory definition of a local land charge. | Negligence need not be established for liability | Restricted to information on the register at the moment the search is made. |
| CON29/O | Wide range of matters                                                                    | Negligence must be established for liability     | May reveal information which affected property in the past, or will do so in future.                                                                             |

### Personal Searches

The local authority can take a few weeks to get back. Possible to undertake a personal search with an agent if needed urgently - the agent will personally search the offices of the appropriate local authority.

There are third party providers holding local information.

Some mortgage lenders will not accept personal searches.

#### Regulation

There is a 'Search Code' monitored and enforced by the Property Codes Compliance Board.

## Seller Enquiries

Pre-contract enquiries of the seller is one of the usual searches made in every transaction.

Object is to obtain information which the seller is not bound by law to disclose. The seller could refuse to answer - but this would not make commercial sense.

### Residential Property

Seller's solicitor should ask client to complete various forms.

| Form | Details                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------- |
| TA06 | Property Information Form         |
| TA07 | Leasehold Information Form        |
| LPE1 | Leasehold Property Enquiries Form |
| LPE2 | Leasehold Consumer Summary Form   |
| FME1 | Freehold Management Enquiries Form.                                   |

An erroneous or misleading reply to these questions could give rise to liability in misrepresentation.

### Commercial Property

Different versions of forms can be used. In order to try to bring some uniformity to preliminary enquiries, the Commercial Property Standard Enquiries (CPSE) have been drafted.

These go from CPSE 1-7.

### Additional Enquiries

Make additional enquiries if needed! This could be on the basis of the information reealed in the standard form.

### Liability

An incorrect reply to pre-contract enquiries may lead to liability in misrepresentation. Any exclusion clauses subject to s 11 [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]].

Where the erroneous reply stems from the seller’s solicitor’s negligence, they will be liable to  
their own client ([[CEMP Proper ties (UK) Ltd v Dentsply Research and Development Corporation (No 1) (1989) 2 EGLR 192]]), but in this respect they do not owe a duty directly to the buyer (see [[Gran Gelato v Richcliffe (Group) [1992] 1 All ER 865]]).

```ad-tip
If the seller says "not so far as the seller is aware", they are representing ([[William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC [1994] 1 WLR 1016]]):
1. Seller has no actual knowledge of a matter
2. All reasonable enquiries that a prudent conveyancer would have made have been made. 
```

## Specific Enquiries

### Water and Drainage Enquiries

Make these enquiries.

If the property does not drain into a public sewer, the buyer will be liable for the costs of maintaining the drains and sewers, and may be liable for the costs of bringing them up to  
adoption standard if the water authority decides to adopt them.

If there is a public sewer on the property, the water company’s consent will be needed to any  
development over or within the vicinity of the sewer.

### Environmental Searches

Consider:

- Contamination of land
- Nearby landfill sites/ factories
- Greenfield/ brownfield site
- Assess risk; if the risk is high, have an environmental survey taken.

### Chancel Repair Searches

Certain properties in certain parishes could be under an obligation to pay the cost of repairing the chancel of the parish church.

This used to be an overriding obligation, but since 13/10/13 is no longer overriding. Easiest option: get insurance.

### Bankruptcy Search

Made against buyer/ borrower to ensure they are not bankrupt. The lender will not lend if the buyer is bankrupt.

The search can be done electronically, or sending Form K16 to the Land Charges Department.

Can take a while; prudent to make this search prior to exchange.

### Company Search

Buyer should search against a corporate seller. Lender should search against a corporate buyer.

There is no standard company search. Check:

- Solvency
- Undisclosed charges
	- Fixed or floating charges
	- No action is needed in relation to charges registered at Companies House, but not protected by registration at Land Registry.
		- Exception: transactions involving sale of chattels.
		- A charge purporting to attach to chattels must be dealt with
			- Fixed charge: discharge before completion
			- Floating charge: obtain a certificate of non-crystallisation, signed by the lender.

### Flood Search

A Government-backed scheme known as ‘Flood Re’ ensures that  
flood cover is provided for most residential properties. Flood Re provides flood insurance for homes over a 25-year period from April 2016. Certain property (such as commercial property, buy to let properties, residential property built since 1 January 2009 and blocks of flats) is not covered by the scheme. Consider insurance.

- Free screening available based on postcode with environmental agency.
- Land Registry provides a flood risk indicator.
- But consider other means, including commercial search providers, enquiries of the seller, specialist surveys.

### Index Map Search

Index of the land in every registered title and pending application for first registration.

```ad-action
Do this search if the land being sold appears to be unregistered. 
```

### Inspection of Property

Always inspect the property.

### Location Specific Searches

A solicitor who fails to carry out a relevant search in circumstances where they should have done so may be liable in negligence to their client ([[G & K Ladenbau (UK) Ltd v Crawley and De Reya [1978] 1 All ER 682]]).

Examples:

- Mining searches
- Common land town and village greens
- Land adjoining rivers, streams or canals
- Railways
- Highways search

Failure to pursue an  
unsatisfactory reply which results in loss being suffered by the client, may result in the buyer’s  
solicitor being liable to their own client in negligence ([[Computastaff Ltd v Ingledew Brown Bennison & Garrett (1983) 7 ILR 156]]).

Also consider:

- Occupiers
- Building works/ changes of usage

### Imputed Knowledge

Knowledge acquired by the solicitor while acting on their client’s behalf is imputed to the  
client (regardless of whether the client had actual knowledge of the matter in question).

An indemnity against the seller's liability in such cases should be sought from the seller's solicitors.

### Searches Made by Third Parties

Can be relied upon, but conduct own searches if you feel the searches another party have done are insufficient.

The solicitor should also remember that if they are acting for the buyer’s lender as  
well as the buyer, they should keep the lender client informed about any matters affecting the  
value or saleability of the property, or which otherwise might affect the lender’s decision to lend on the security of the property.

### Estate Roads

The new estate roads are likely to be 'adopted' (publicly maintained) by the local authority, though they might not be. Between developer and buyer there should be a clause stipulating that the developer will be responsible for making up the roads to the local authority's standard and keeping them in that condition until adopted, at no extra cost to buyer.

Check to see that a Highways Act  
1980 Section 38 Agreement has been entered into by the developer with the highway  
authority. This is an agreement between the developer and the highway authority that the  
developer will be responsible for the roads. This agreement must therefore be supported by a financial bond, issued by a bank  
or an insurance company, in a sufficient amount to cover against the developer defaulting on the Road Agreement.

In cases where there is no agreement and bond, a mortgage lender will usually protect itself  
against the property owner having to pay road charges by making a retention from the  
advance of the estimated cost of those charges. This retention will be released only when the  
roads are adopted.

### Drains and Sewers

Check whether the ownership and maintenance of the drains has been or is to be transferred to the water authority. If the water authority were to adopt the drains without their having been constructed to the proper standards, there is a risk that the  
properties being served might incur charges.
