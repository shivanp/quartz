# Draft Contract

- Although title is transferred in the transfer deed on completion, the terms of the transfer deed are fixed by the terms of the contract.
- The seller drafts the contract, but terms are open to negotiation.

## Seller's Capacity

Check the seller is entitled to sell the whole of the estate in land. Some circumstances require further investigation.

| Seller                         | Action                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trustees (including co-owners) | A second trustee may be needed to overreach any beneficial entitlement.                                                                                           |
| Personal representatives       | If there is only 1, they can contract to sell the land alone. If there are multiple, they should all be party to the contract as sellers.                         |
| Mortgage lenders               | Lender must have an express/ implied power of sale, which has arisen and become exercisable.                                                                      |
| Companies                      | Check objects clause if appliable. If the land is registered, there will be an entry on the proprietorship register if there are any restrictions on the company. |
| Mentally disabled persons      | If the seller cannot understand the nature of the transaction, it is voidable at the option of the seller if the buyer was aware of the disability.                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Elements of Contract

- States that the seller agrees to seller and buyer to buy.
- Sets out the terms of sale
- Usually comprised of:
	- Particulars of sale
	- Standard conditions of sale
	- Special conditions.

> [!statute] s 2 LP(MP)A
> (1) A contract for the sale or other disposition of an interest in land can only be made **in writing** and only by **incorporating all the terms** which the parties have expressly agreed in one document or, where contracts are exchanged, in each.
> 
> (2) The terms may be incorporated in a document either by being **set out in it or by reference to some other document**.

## Particulars of Sale

- Describe the estate in land which is being sold.
- Might reference easements/ covenants benefitting the land
- Aim: clear and precise description of the property.
- Usually postal address and registered title number suffices.

### Plans

- Must be used if selling a part of land
- Desirable in other cases if property boundaries not self-evident.
- Generally not necessary for the sale of the whole of a registered freehold.
- Land Registry Practice Guide 40: detailed requirements of plans submitted.
- Seller usually pays for preparation of the plan.
- Showing features
	- Sold land in red
	- Retained land in blue
	- Agreed ownership of boundaries indicated by “T” marks; T on the side of the boundary responsible for maintenance.
	- Use a key.

There should be no discrepancy between the verbal description of land and the plan. If there is:

| Terminology                    | Construction                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Identification purposes only" | Verbal description prevails. Note the Land Registry will not accept such a plan. |
| "More particularly delineated" | Plan prevails. Only use if the plan is to scale.                                                                                  |

### Easements and Rights

Investigation of title will reveal whether the property has the benefit of easements/ rights. May be included in the particulars of sale, but not essential since the benefit will pass under s 62 LPA 1925.

Errors in the particulars of sale may give the buyer a remedy in misdescription/ misrepresentation.

## Standard Conditions

- SCPCs designed for use in more complex and high-value commercial property transactions.
	- Part 1 conditions are of general application and apply unless varied by special condition.
	- Part 2 conditions only relevant for certain transactions, only apply if specifically incorporated by special condition.
- SCs are less extensive, designed for residential or lower value transactions.

Possible to purchase a pre-printed contract with gaps to insert transaction details. Most law firms will have their own precedents.

## Special Conditions

Purposes:

1. May be necessary to deal with particular circumstances of transaction.
2. May be desirable to vary the standard condition position.

> [!important]
> If a special condition contradicts the standard condition position, the special condition prevails (Standard Condition 1.1.4/ SCPC 1.1.4(a)). But often the standard condition is expressly excluded for the avoidance of doubt. 

The seller's solicitor should consider the following areas when deciding which special conditions are needed for drafting the contract.

### Seller's Duty to Disclose Incumbrances

Standard Condition 3.1.1 and SCPC 4.1.1 state that the seller will sell the property free from incumbrances other than those listed in SC 3.1.2 and SCPC 4.1.2. So the seller’s solicitor must list in a special condition all incumbrances not covered by SC 3.1.2 or SCPC 4.1.2.

Some practitioners just list all incumbrances as a special condition, regardless of whether covered under one of the standard conditions.

> [!note] Defects in title
> Standard Condition 3.1.1 and SCPC 4.1.1 imply that there is no other flaw/ defect in the title. Such flaws must therefore be specifically disclosed by a special conditions, or the buyer will have remedies for non-disclosure. Also state that the buyer will not be entitled to raise any objection to the defect. 

- If a Green Deal plan exists, the contract must acknowledge that the buyer will pay this.
- Physical defects do not need to be disclosed (SC 3.2.1 and SCPC 4.2.1).
- If there is a defect in title, consider seeking insurance.
	- Then negotiate who should pay for this.
	- If the seller is paying, insert a special condition to this effect.

### Deducing Title

Traditionally, title investigation and deduction took place after contracts were exchanged. It was therefore important for rules to exist governing what the seller had to produce to establish proper title. Standard Condition 4.1 (SCPC 7.1) sets out what documentary evidence of title the seller is to provide.

Modern practice is for title to be deduced and investigated before contracts are exchanged. This happens in the vast majority of cases. As a result, the rules governing deduction of title are often not considered because exchange will not take place until the investigating party is satisfied on title. If title has been deduced before exchange, no requisitions can be raised on that title (SC 4.2.1 and SCPC 7.2.1).

### Title Guarantee

The buyer can be given the benefit of certain implied covenants under LP(MP)A 1994.

- “The seller sells with full title guarantee” gives the buyer the benefit of all covenants implied under LP(MP)A 1994
	1. A covenant that the seller has the right to dispose of the land.
	2. A covenant that the seller will do all he reasonably can to transfer the title.
	3. If the land disposed of is leasehold land, a covenant that the lease is subsisting at the time it is disposed of, and that there is no breach of covenant making the lease liable to forfeiture.
	4. A covenant that the land is disposed of free from incumbrances, other than those the seller does not know about and could not reasonably know about. Subject to s 6 LP(MP)A 1994 - the seller is not in breach of any implied covenants in respect of:
		1. Matters to which the disposition is expressly made subject
		2. Matters which buyer knows about at the time of disposition
		3. Matters entered on the register of title at the time of disposition.
- "The seller sells with limited title guarantee"
	- (1) to (3) as above.
	- (4) swapper for the seller promising that he has not incumbered the land
- Possible to sell with no title guarantee.
- Both sets of standard conditions imply full title guarantee (SC 4.6.2, SCPC 7.6.2).

#### Choosing Title Guarantee

If the seller has good title and knowledge of incumbrances, no reason not to give a full title guarantee. If the seller has limited knowledge of the property, give a limited title guarantee. Where the seller has no title/ questionable title, insert a special condition to negate the implied promise that the seller has good title.

If the landlord grants a lease with full or limited title guarantee, the covenants for title given by seller to buyer will be impliedly given by the landlord to the tenant.

### Vacant Possession

Seller's solicitor must specify by special condition whether the property is being sold with vacant possession or subject to occupational leases. If subject to lease, supply to buyer.

If vacant possession intended, but there is an occupier, it will be necessary to ensure that the person will vacate the property on completion → check the person has no legal interest and any equitable interest was overreached. Good practice to get the occupier to confirm vacation in the contract.

### Date of Completion

- If no date of completion is inserted in the contract on exchange, SC 6.1.1/ SCPC 9.1.1 sets completion as **20 working days** after the date of contract.
- SC 6.1.1/ SCPC 9.1.1: time is not of the essence unless where a notice of completion has been served.
	- This has contract law applications: a delay in completion will not be a repudiatory breach unless time is of the essence.
- Usually, a time on the particular day should also be imposed. Ensure there is sufficient time for the seller to complete dependent purchase.

### Delayed Completion Compensation

SC 6.1.2/ SCPC 9.1.2 states that if the completion monies are received after 2.00 pm then, for the purposes of calculating compensation, completion is deemed to have occurred on the next working day. The 2.00 pm cut off can be changed by special condition if the parties agree.

| Standard conditions | Who pays compensation            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| SC                  | Party at fault pays compensation |
| SCPC                | Buyer pays compensation if he has defaulted and completion is delayed. Buyer has no contractual right to compensation if seller defaults.                                  |

Standard Condition 7.2 (SCPC 10.3) contains provisions for the payment of compensation for  
late completion, and states that the amount of such payment shall be assessed at the ‘contract  
rate’ as defined. According to SC 1.1.1(e) (SCPC 1.1.1(e)), the contract rate, unless altered by  
special condition, is ‘The Law Society’s interest rate from time to time in force’. Set at Barclays base lending rate + 4%.

### Deposit

Customary for buyer to pay a deposit of 10% on exchange of contracts. If the buyer subsequently defaults, the seller would have a right to forfeit the deposit.

SC 2.2/ SCPC 3.2 provides for payment of a 10% deposit to be held by the seller’s solicitor in the capacity of **stakeholder**.

### Indemnity Covenants

To pass on the chain of indemnities, the seller should take an indemnity covenant from the buyer. This may only be included in the transfer if provided for in the contract. SC 4.6.4/ SCPC 7.6.5 makes provision for such an indemnity (but often expressly provided for).

### Fixtures and Fittings

- Fixtures pass automatically, fittings/ chattels do not
- Vary this by special condition if required.

### VAT

Contract should deal with VAT.

## Unfair Contract Terms

Possible application of [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] Part 2 if the contract is between a consumer and trader. In these cases the contract must be transparent and fair. “Fair” does not apply to the contract price, provided it is transparent.

- ‘Consumer’ means an individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual’s trade, business, craft or profession (CRA 2015, s 2(1)).
- ‘Trader’ means a person acting for purposes relating to that person’s trade, business, craft or profession, whether acting personally or through another person acting in the trader’s name or on the trader’s behalf (CRA 2015, s 2(2)).

## Buyer's Consideration

- Only make amendments where necessary and relevant.
- A “travelling draft” of the contract will go back and forth between buyer's and seller's solicitors
- A clean copy should be sent to the buyer's solicitor to approve.
- They can return it “approved as drawn”
- Copies to sign (engrossments) produced by seller's solicitor.
