# Insurance

## Risk to Property

At common law, and under both sets of Standard Conditions, the risk of accidental damage to the property passes to the buyer from the moment of exchange of contracts, unless the loss/ damage was attributable to the seller's lack of care ([[Clarke v Ramuz [1891] 2 QB 456]]).

A solicitor who fails to advise on the consequences of failing to insure will be liable in negligence, if the client suffers loss due to lack of insurance.

## Insuring Property

Either:

1. Note that the property is on a block policy held by the buyer's solicitor, covering all properties handled by the firm
2. If there is a mortgage, the lender will usually insure on the request of the buyer's solicitor. Check that the cover will be adequate, the property will be covered from the date of exchange of contracts, and the insurance requirements do not conflict with the terms of the contract/ any lease.
3. Buyer takes out insurance themselves.

### FSMA

To advise on arranging an insurance contract, rely on the "professional firms exemption". Firm must be registered in the FCA Register and must appoint a compliance officer.

## Seller's Risk

Commonly, for new property in the course of construction, the property remains at the seller's risk until completion. If acting for the seller, exclude s 47 LPA 1925 (so buyer can't claim off seller's insurance).

## Buyer's Risk

SC 5.1.2 and SCPC 8.2.4(a) provide that the seller is under no obligation to insure the property, except where required by the terms of any lease or the contract of sale. It is therefore essential for a buyer to take out his own policy of insurance as from exchange.

In practice, it is likely that the seller will keep up his policy until completion, and if the seller has a mortgage, he will be required to do so.

> [!question] What if there are two policies?
> There is a dnager that on a claim being made, each insurance firm would reduce the payout based on the existence of the other police. SC 5.1.5, SCPC 8.2.4(b): if there is a reduction to the payment made to the buyer for this reason, the purchase price is to be reduced accordingly. 

Except where the seller is required by a condition of the contract of sale or his mortgage or lease to maintain his policy, he could cancel his insurance policy on exchange of contracts, but in practice he would be unwise to do so (eg, in case the buyer failed to complete).

## Other Insurance

Where appropriate, the buyer should take out contents insurance, life assurance etc. If a solicitor is advising, this raises FSMA regulated investment considerations.
