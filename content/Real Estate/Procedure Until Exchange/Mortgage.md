# Mortgage

See [[Mortgages]].

## Mortgage Offer

- Lender performs due diligence before offering loan
- Then sends borrower an offer setting out terms
	- Residential: 'mortgage offer'
	- Commercial: 'commitment letter' with 'term sheet' attached, followed by 'facility agreement' setting out detailed terms of loan.

## Terms of Offer

 Mortgage offer will include:

 1. Description of property
 2. Amount of advance and period of mortgage
 3. Whether mortgage is repayment or interest-only
 4. Applicable interest rate
 5. Amount of initial monthly repayments.
 6. Insurance details
	 - Where lender is to insure property,
	 - amount of cover and
	 - when cover will start.
 7. Details of repair works lender requires to be carried out to the property.
 8. Amount of any 'guarantee premium' payable by the borrower.
	 - This is insurance taken out to insure the lender against not being able to recover the full amount owing on resale of the property.
	 - Cost borne by lender.
9. Residential: term that any existing mortgage will be discharged before completion of the new loan.

## Conditions

- Ensure client understands conditions and terms attached to the mortgage offer and will be able to comply with them.
- Check the offer to see if the lender requires a formal acceptance of the offer.
- Check whether the mortgage offer is expressed so as not to be legally binding on lender/ subject to a condition allowing the lender to withdraw after formal acceptance (e.g., if there is a material adverse change to market/ borrower).

## Instructions to Act

- The lender will instruct solicitors to act for it.
- In residential cases, usually the same solicitor acts for both the borrower and lender.
- The solicitor must always bear in mind that they owe a duty to both clients ([[Mortgage Express v Bowerman & Partners (A Firm) [1996] 2 All ER 836]]).

### Lender's Handbook

The solicitor must ensure that they carry out their lender client’s instructions as set out in both parts of the Lenders’ Handbook. This contains standardised mortgage instructions.

### BSA Mortgage Instructions

The Building Societies Association (BSA) has developed a set of voluntary mortgage instructions.

## Conflict of Interests

Where there is a conflict of interest which cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of both clients, the solicitor cannot continue to act for both.

Where a conflict of interests exists between the buyer client and the lender client, the solicitor, acting in their capacity of adviser to the buyer, may disclose the nature of the conflict to the lender only with the consent of the buyer client ([[Halifax Mortgage Services v Stepsky [1996] 1 FLR 620]]).

Note that the solicitor’s duty of confidentiality to the buyer is discharged in a case of mortgage fraud.

## Reporting to Lender

The lender will want to know whether the property is adequate security for the loan and has a 'good and marketable' title. Standard forms which can be used.

## Mortgage Documentation

### Residential

A mortgage of a residential property to be used as the borrower’s home or a simple commercial property loan granted by an institutional lender (such as a high street bank or building society) is likely to involve a single mortgage deed in the lender’s standard form. This usually incorporates standard terms.

### Commercial

For a complex loan secured on commercial property, there may be a loan agreement (sometimes called a facility letter or credit agreement) and a separate charge by way of legal mortgage, or a debenture incorporating a charge by way of legal mortgage.

Will usually include:

1. Commercial details of the transaction
2. Property charged by way of legal mortgage
	- Creates an interest in favour of the lender equivalent to a 3,000-year lease (or for a leasehold, a term of one day less than the lease).
- The document which charges the property will be a deed.
- Potentially additional security (fixed and floating charges)
- Statement of liabilities owed by the borrower to the lender.
	- Often includes an 'all monies charge' securing any sums owed by the borrower to the lender.
- Require borrower to make representations and warranties about status
- Borrower enters into covenants relating to the property (e.g., keeping it in repair)
- Set out events of default
- Extend statutory powers of sale, leasing, accepting surrenders and exclude s 93 LPA 1925,
	- allowing the lender to refuse to discharge the mortgage until all loans secured have been repaid ('consolidation')
- Prohibit borrower from creating any other mortgages over the property.
	- Gives lender the power to refuse any request by the borrower to take out another loan secured on the property from a different lender.
	- First lender may want to make further advance to the borrower and ensure this is secured by the first legal mortgage (“tacking”). But tacking is complicated and simpler to prohibit subsequent mortgages.

```ad-note
title: Floating charges

Where the lender has also taken a floating charge, the negative pledge supports the floating charge and gives it effective priority. A properly registered first legal mortgage will automatically have priority over any legal mortgage created later in time. Any second mortgage that is granted in favour of a new lender will take priority over the floating charge unless the new lender has notice of the negative pledge at the time it takes the security. If it does have notice, priority is reversed and the new lender’s security, although valid, will rank behind the floating charge. So, a negative pledge is an effective way to prevent the borrower creating a second mortgage which would take priority over the first lender’s floating charge.
```

The borrower’s solicitor is under an obligation to explain the nature and effect of the mortgage documentation to the client in whatever level of detail is appropriate.
