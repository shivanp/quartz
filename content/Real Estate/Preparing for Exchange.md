# Preparing for Exchange

On exchange, a binding contract comes into existence.

## Stuff to Check

- Searches
- Financial arrangements
- Deposit
- Contract
- Insurance
- Completion date
- Method of exchange
- Signature of contract
- Occupiers

## Reporting to Client

When searches and enquiries are complete and the draft contract has been agreed, the buyer's solicitor should report to their client in writing (“Buyer's Report”).

## Signature

Both parties must sign the contract (or each sign identical copies) – s 2 LP(MP)A 1989. Signatures do not need to be witnessed. Signature by an authorised agent is acceptable.

- Tell the client explicitly where and how to sign. Request a cheque for the deposit, indicating the due date.
- A solicitor needs their client's express authority to sign a contract on behalf of their client. Should be obtained in writing after explaining the consequences.
- An officer of a company can usually sign on behalf of the company, if the transaction is authorised.
- Electronic signatures are fine (Law Society Practice Note, 2016).
- Ensure all email correspondence is marked "subject to contract", else [[Neocleous v Rees [2019] EWHC 2462 (Ch)]] - an automatically generated email footer containing name and address could amount to an enforceable contract.
- Ensure the client's authority has been obtained prior to exchange.
