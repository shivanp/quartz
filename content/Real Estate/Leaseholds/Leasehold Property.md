# Leasehold Property

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

- Flexibility over length of term.
- Landlord gets a steady income from the property
- Landlord retains an interest, which is a saleable capital asset.
- Parties able to easily enforce covenants; almost all covenants enforceable against successors in title.
	- So leaseholds common where a property forms part of a larger building.
	- Service charge payable by tenants for maintenance of common areas.

Disadvantages:

- Lease will eventually expire; tenant may not be able to stay indefinitely.
- Lease is a wasting asset (if it has a capital value).
- Burdens on tenants (covenants and restrictions).
- Landlord can forfeit lease as a remedy for breach of obligations.
- Landlords also take on burdens.

## Types

### Residential Short-term

Usually granted at full open market rent (“rack rent”). The lease has no capital value in the hands of the tenant. Lease cannot be assigned. Tenants have certain statutory rights and protections.

### Residential Long-term

- Standard where properties form part of a larger building.
- Leaseholds allow greater ability to enforce positive and negative covenants.
- Lease granted for a long term in return for a lump sum payment and low “ground rent”.
- Leases have a capital value and there are few controls on the tenant's ability to dispose of the property by assignment.
- Very similar conveyancing process to freeholds.
- The developer will usually dispose of the freehold of the common parts to a management company.

### Commercial Property Market

Most commercial property is occupied under leases because of the flexibility they offer, and the undesirability of tying up capital in a freehold.

```ad-defn
title: Institutional lease
Where the landlord passes the day-to-day operational cost for occupying the property to the teants, leaving rent as "pure profit". 
```

- Leases are usually 5-15 years long.
- Possible for a capital sum to be payable, but this is rare. A market rent is payable and this is subject to rent review every few years.
- Leases of commercial property usually contain detailed controls on the tenant's freedom to assign/ deal with the property.
- Terms subject to detailed negotiation.
- The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) has produced a Code for Leasing Business Premises, which is a “professional standard” (surveyors must stick to it).
- Less usual for parties to exchange contracts (unlikely to need to synchronise a chain of transactions).

## Terminology

- A lease is “granted” when first created.
- The first lease is the head-lease (the only superior title is the freehold reversion).
- Sublease can be granted out of the head-lease.
- The transfer of a leasehold is an “assignment”
- When granting a sublease, the period must be shorter than that of the head-lease (else it will be treated as an assignment)
- There are commonly restrictions on assignment and subletting.

## Licences

1. Licences are traditionally regarded as personal permissions, as opposed to being proprietary in nature.
	- Licences are regarded as capable of binding the licensor and licensee only.
	- So licences are interests that operate over land rather than being [[interests in land]].
	- Licences are not proprietary rights capable of binding third parties ([[National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth (1965)]]). Licences can be revoked by the licensor.
	- But this characterisation of licences as purely personal, non-proprietary interests has been subject to criticism and comment.
2. Licences also operate to render lawful conduct which might otherwise constitute a trespass on someone else's land.
3. There are no general formalities for the creation of licences, though some types of licence do require a degree of compliance with formality.
	- Licences can be created orally or in writing, can be express or implied and can be contained within deeds or as part of the conveyancing process
	- May also arise where the formalities for creating proprietary interests fail to be satisfied.
4. The nature and extent of licences is determined by having regard to the specific terms of the licence.

## Characteristics

If it is found that the characteristics of a lease are not present, looking at the transaction objectively, then the arrangement can only be a licence.

```ad-tip
title: Requirements
For a lease to exist, rather than a licence, there needs to be:
1. Certainty of term
2. Exclusive possession
3. The correct formalities used to create the lease
```

- Certainty of term means that the tenancy must be granted for a certain duration. This means you need to know when the arrangement will end.
	- If certainty of term is not present in the arrangement, no lease will be found.
	- In the case of [[Lace v Chantler [1944] KB 368]] a lease ‘for the duration of the war’ failed for lack of certainty.
	- The usual way of satisfying this requirement is a fixed term lease, e.g., five-year term.
- Exclusive possession means the right to exclude all others from the property, including the landlord.
- Formalities are the rules that must be followed to formalise the arrangement, i.e., the steps the parties need to take.
	- Given the proprietary status of a lease, there is a high degree of formality that the parties must adhere to in order to create the legal estate.

### Certainty of Term

This can be shown either with a fixed or periodic term.

- A **fixed term** exists where the maximum duration of the arrangement is known from the outset.
	- Once a fixed term lease is created, neither party can unilaterally bring the lease to an end earlier, unless there is a break clause
- A **periodic tenancy** is technically a lease for one period. This is generally weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly.
	- The tenancy extends itself automatically unless either the landlord or tenant give notice to terminate the tenancy.
	- An **express** periodic tenancy is where there is a written agreement documenting the agreement.
	- An **implied** periodic tenancy is where there is nothing set out in writing, but the certain term arises by looking objectively at all relevant circumstances, including payment and acceptance of rent on a periodic basis.

```ad-example
Monthly payments of rent (without agreement on a fixed term from the outset) may create an implied monthly periodic tenancy.
```

See also [[Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body [1992] 2 A.C. 386]].

The 'term' of the periodic tenancy depends upon the period by reference to which the rent is calculated, rather than the intervals at which it is payable.

e.g., if the tenant agrees to pay £10,000 a year by four quarterly payments, the tenancy is a yearly tenancy not a quarterly tenancy, because the rent is calculated annually.

### Exclusive Possession

```ad-defn
Exclusive possession means the right to exclude all others from the property, including the landlord.
```

Demonstrating that exclusive possession has been granted is often difficult. Historically, tenants of residential leases were granted greater protection and landlords were keen to avoid granting leases. There are many cases where the court considered the nature of an arrangement, looking beyond the label given to the agreement by the parties (headline case: [[Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809]]).

```ad-info
Since the introduction of Assured Shorthold Tenancies (ASTs), the distinction between  a lease and licence is of far less importance in a residential context.
```

Whether exclusive possession exists is a question of fact in each case: the substance of the agreement has to be examined. The courts will look at the reality of a situation. So even if a clause appears to defeat exclusion possession but has been inserted into a lease only to make what would otherwise be a lease appear like a licence, it will be thrown out as a sham.

N.B. do not confuse exclusive possession with exclusive occupation.

#### Retention of a Key

The fact that a landlord retains a key to the premises may make it appear as if the occupant does not have exclusive possession. However, it is the **purpose for which the key is retained** that matters.

For example, if the key is used only in an emergency or by arrangement, then exclusive possession may still exist.

The courts will look at whether any right of access the landlord has is **restricted** or **unrestricted**.

If the access is restricted e.g., 'to carry out repairs' then this is seen as more of an acknowledgement of exclusive possession by the landlord, rather than something that will defeat it. This was expressed by the court in [[Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809]]

In [[Aslan v Murphy [1990] 1 WLR 766]] the court held “there is no magic in the retention of a key” – it will not determine the nature of arrangement either way.

#### Landlord Provides Services

If the landlord provides attendance or services there is a licence not a tenancy ([[Marchant v Charters [1977] 1 WLR 1181]].)

Services would include cleaning, changing linen etc.

The occupier is simply a **lodger** provided the services are actually carried out, and a **lodger will never enjoy exclusive possession** of the premises.

#### Sharing Clauses

If a landlord reserves the right to share the property with the occupiers or reserves the right to introduce others to share, that may mean that there is no exclusive possession, as the occupier **cannot exclude** whoever the landlord is able to introduce.

All of the circumstances must be looked at to see whether this is a **genuine clause** or simply a **sham** to defeat exclusive possession, as was made clear in [[A G Securities v Vaughan [1990] 1 AC 417]] and [[Antoniades v Villiers [1990] 1 AC 417]].

The following circumstances should therefore be considered when determining if a sharing clause is genuine or a sham:

- The size and nature of the accommodation – would it be realistic to introduce others into the accommodation given its size?
- The relationship between the occupiers (if there is more than one) – would it be appropriate to introduce another to share given the relationship between the occupiers?
- The wording of the clause (i.e., how widely it is drafted, as the wider it is drafted, the more likely it is a sham clause.)
- Whether the clause has ever been exercised – if it has not been exercised then this may indicate it is a sham clause.

#### Quiet Enjoyment

If there is a clause for a tenant's 'quiet enjoyment of the land', this points towards a lease ([[Addiscombe Garden Estates v Crabbe [1958] 1 QB 513]]).

### Business Tenancies

[[Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809]] is equally applicable to non-residential tenancies.

A business tenant must also show it has a certain term and exclusive possession of the premises in order to establish it is a tenant, rather than licensee.

In the context of business arrangements, the result affects security of tenure, as business tenants (but not licensees) are protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, entitling them to remain in the premises at the end of the lease term and request a new lease.

In the business context, the court tends to construe the document as a whole to see if the landlord retains control over the property. In this setting, the courts are more prepared to accept the reality of the label 'licence' than they are in the residential context as there tends to be more equality in bargaining power, with commercial leases often negotiated and parties legally represented.

#### Control

The issue of control in a business context came before the court in [[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Fumegrange Ltd and others [1994] 2 EGLR 90]].

```ad-note
title: *[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Fumegrange Ltd and others [1994] 2 EGLR 90]]*
The court considered whether exclusive possession of two service stations was granted to Fumegrange.

The court held that the degree of control exercised by Esso over the premises and the way in which it was conducted was inconsistent with an exclusive right to possession of the service stations being vested in Fumegrange. Esso could make alterations on the premises; it could install a car wash (as was in fact done); and it could change the layout of the shop. This degree of physical control over the premises and conduct of the business at the service station was held to be very significant.
```

#### Right to Relocate

If the occupation agreement contains a right for the landlord to relocate and move the tenant to alternative premises, it will not be a lease.

> …you cannot have a tenancy granting exclusive possession of particular premises, subject to a provision that the landlord can require the tenant to move to somewhere else.  
> [[Dresden Estates v Collinson [1988] 55 P & CR 47]]

Of course, if such a clause is a sham clause, it will not defeat exclusive possession in the circumstances and will be disregarded by the court. The courts will always look at the substance of an arrangement.

### Commencement Date

```ad-defn
title: Commencement date
The date when the term of the lease begins. 
```

A lease does not have to take effect in possession immediately and can be granted to take effect at some future time, provided this is within 21 years of its grant (s 149(3) LPA 1925). The commencement date can be backdated to a date before the date of grant of the lease (useful if a landlord wants all the leases to expire at the same time).

## Formalities

The formalities required to create a legal lease will depend on the length of the term of the lease.

| Rules                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| General rule              | To create a legal lease, a deed must be used ([LPA 1925, s 52](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/52)). The requirements of a valid deed are set out in [LP(MP)A 1989, s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/34/section/1).                                                                                                                |
| Leases over 7 years       | If the term of the lease is over 7 years, the lease must also be with registered ([LRA 2002, s 27(2)(b)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27)). This is a compulsory registration requirement. If not done a legal leasehold estate will not have been created (LRA 2002, s 27 (1)). |
| Leases of 7 years or less | If the term of the lease is 7 years or less, the lease does not need to be registered. Such leases still take effect as legal leases and will be binding on a new freehold estate owner as an overriding interest ([LRA 2002, sch 3 para 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/schedule/3)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Short Lease Exception

Certain short leases, which fulfil certain conditions, have no formal requirements, yet they will still exist as legal leases. They need not even be in writing.

[LPA 1925, s 54 (2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/54) states that a lease with a term of three years or less need not be created by deed provided the following three conditions are all met:

1. The lease takes effect in possession (i.e., the tenant takes the lease immediately).
2. The lease is granted at 'best rent' (which has been interpreted as meaning ‘market rent’).
3. The lease is not subject to a fine or premium (meaning there is no upfront payment for the grant of the lease, which you could commonly expect to see with very long leases).

These short leases, also called **parol leases**, whether created by deed or less formally under s 54(2), do not need to be registered to exist as legal leases because only leases of over 7 years must be registered. Leases less than 3 years can even be orally agreed, they don't even need to be in writing.

The types of arrangement which fall within the ambit of this exception are:

- **Short fixed term leases** (those with a maximum term of three years or less.)
- **Express periodic tenancies** (where there is a tenancy agreement.)
- **Implied periodic tenancies** (where an occupier is in possession and paying a rent at regular intervals.)

Note that periodic tenancies, whether express or implied, will only fall within the ambit of [LPA 1925, s 54(2)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/54) if each individual period of the tenancy is for **three years or less**, which is likely to be the case.

```ad-example
- **Short fixed term leases:** A tenant rents a flat for an agreed fixed term of 2 years. This arrangement does not need to be in writing.
- **Express periodic tenancies:** A tenant rents a flat on a rolling monthly basis paying an agreed monthly rent. There is a written agreement documenting the agreement. In this situation, the written agreement does not need to comply with any formalities.
- **Implied periodic tenancies:** A tenant is in occupation of premises paying an agreed rent on a monthly basis, but nothing documents this arrangement. In this situation, a periodic tenancy may be implied. It will still be a legal lease because no formalities are required to document the arrangement.
```

### Equitable Leases

An equitable lease may be created deliberately, if the parties choose to enter into a contract for lease, or it may be that the parties try to create a legal lease but fail, by either not creating a valid deed or not registering the lease, if required.

The courts will recognise the tenant has having an equitable interest in the land (an equitable lease) on the same terms as the defective legal lease providing:

1. There is a document that complies with LP(MP)A 1989, s 2 – signed contract in writing and incorporating all express terms.
2. The remedy of specific performance is available.

```ad-important
Where there is a conflict between the common law and equity, equity will prevail ([[Walsh v Lonsdale (1882)]])
```

Equitable leases usually require some form of registration to make them binding on a purchaser of the reversion. If the reversionary title is registered, the lease must be registered as a minor interest (i.e., notice) on the charges register of the reversionary title. But can be binding without registration if there is an overriding interest (Sch 3 LRA 2002).

## Liability on Covenants in Leases

### Leases Granted on or After 01/01/96

LTCA 1995 applies to leases granted on or after 01/01/96. It is the date of grant of the lease, not of subsequent assignment, which determines this.

When the tenant lawfully assigns the lease, he is automatically released from future liability under the lease covenants, unless he has agreed to enter into an authorised guarantee agreement (AGA). Under such an agreement, the outgoing tenant guarantees the performance of the lease covenants by his immediate successor in title.

The tenant is only obliged to provide an AGA if:

1. In leases of commercial property, where the parties have agreed in the lease that an AGA is to be provided on assignment.
2. If the landlord requires the provision of an AGA as a condition of giving consent to an assignment.

- The guarantee in the AGA extends only the the performance of covenants by the immediate successor in title only.
- An assignee of the lease gets the benefit of landlord covenants when he takes over an assignment of the lease (s 3(2)(b) LTCA 1995).
- He is bound by all the tenant's covenants except those expressly stated to be personal to the original tenant (s 3(2)(a) LTCA 1995).
- The assignee remains liable for any breaches committed before the date of assignment but is released from liability for any future breaches, unless also required to give an AGA to guarantee the performance of lease covenants.
- The automatic release provisions do not apply if the assignment is in breach of a covenant in the lease/ if it occurs by operation of law.
- Where a former tenant remains liable under an AGA, the former tenant should seek an indemnity covenant from successor in title
	- In the absence of such an indemnity, an indemnity under common law could be claimed under the rule in [[Moule v Garrett (1872) LR 7 Exch 101]].
- Any subsequent assignee of the landlord's interest gets the benefit of the tenant's covenants when taking an assignment of the lease (s 3(3)(b) LTCA 1995).
- Each landlord is **not** automatically released from covenants when selling the reversion, but can apply to the tenant to be released from future liability before/ within 4 weeks of the date of assignment of the reversion.

### Leases Granted Before 01/01/96

#### Tenant Liability

- The original tenant **remains bound by lease covenants under privity of contract**.
	- Continues even after assignment unless landlord expressly releases the tenant.
- Any assignee also liable for breaches committed whilst ownership of the land is vested in that assignee in respect of covenants which "touch and concern" the land (those entered into parties as landowners, rather than as individuals) $\rightarrow$ privity of estate.
- Original landlord has the benefit of tenant covenants by privity of contract.
- Landlord's successor in title takes the benefit of tenant covenants under s 141(1) LPA 1925.

So the landlord could seek redress against either the original tenant or any assignee who committed the breach. Where the original landlord transfers the reversion, the right to sue passes to the transferee of that reversion (all rights of action pass to the transferee – s 141).

So, an assignee of a lease will usually be required to indemnify the assignor in respect of any breach of covenant committed after the date of assignment. Registered lease; such an indemnity covenant is implied by Sch 12 para 20 LRA 2002, whether or not the assignment is for value.

- (a) in the case of a transfer of the whole of the land comprised in the registered lease, the covenant in sub-paragraph (2), and
- (b) in the case of a transfer of part of the land comprised in the lease—
	- (i) the covenant in sub-paragraph (3), and
	- (ii) where the transferor continues to hold land under the lease, the covenant in sub-paragraph (4).

(2) The transferee covenants with the transferor that during the residue of the term granted by the registered lease the transferee and the persons deriving title under him will—
- (a) pay the rent reserved by the lease,
- (b) comply with the covenants and conditions contained in the lease, and
- (c) keep the transferor and the persons deriving title under him indemnified against all actions, expenses and claims on account of any failure to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b).

(3) The transferee covenants with the transferor that during the residue of the term granted by the registered lease the transferee and the persons deriving title under him will—
- (a) where the rent reserved by the lease is apportioned, pay the rent apportioned to the part transferred,
- (b) comply with the covenants and conditions contained in the lease so far as affecting the part transferred, and
- (c) keep the transferor and the persons deriving title under him indemnified against all actions, expenses and claims on account of any failure to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b).

(4) The transferor covenants with the transferee that during the residue of the term granted by the registered lease the transferor and the persons deriving title under him will—
- (a) where the rent reserved by the lease is apportioned, pay the rent apportioned to the part retained,
- (b) comply with the covenants and conditions contained in the lease so far as affecting the part retained, and
- (c) keep the transferee and the persons deriving title under him indemnified against all actions, expenses and claims on account of any failure to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b).

(5) This paragraph does not apply to a lease which is a new tenancy for the purposes of section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 (c. 30).

```

SCPC 7.6.5 requires the transfer deed to contain an express indemnity covenant, except where one is implied by law.

```ad-important
If the lease contains a requirement to obtain the landlord’s consent before any assignment takes place, the landlord may, in appropriate circumstances, insist that any assignee enter into a direct contractual relationship with him to observe the tenant’s covenants under the lease for the remainder of the term. This imposes on any assignee the same liability under privity of contract as faced by the original tenant. 
```

#### Landlord Liability

If an original landlord is unable through his own act or default (e.g., by transferring the reversion to a third party) to carry out an obligation imposed on him by the lease, the landlord may be liable in damages to the tenant ([[Eagon v Dent [1965] 2 All ER 335]]).

Any transferee of the reversion for the time being will also be liable in respect of breaches of covenant which touch and concern the land, which are committed whilst the reversion is vested in them (privity of estate).

### LT(C)A 1995 Retrospective Provisions

![[LT(C)A retrospective_1.jpg]]

There are some sections of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 which apply to all leases, regardless of when they were created. These are:

Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995

- s 17, Tenant Default Notice
- s 18, Liability for Variations
- s 19, Overriding Leases

These provisions apply to both old and new leases.

These provisions apply to former tenants who remain liable either under an old lease (existing tenant liability) or because of their liability under a new lease under an authorised guarantee agreement.

#### Tenant Default Notice

The [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 17](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/17) states that where a landlord wishes to pursue a former tenant who remains liable under the terms of the lease for a fixed charge, the landlord must serve notice of the potential claim on such tenants within **6 months** of the charge becoming due.

```ad-tip
So practically, cannot recover more than 6 months rent at a time in this way. 
```

A fixed charge is defined in the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 17](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/17) as including arrears of rent, service charge or insurance premiums but not unascertained liabilities or damages which become ascertained only after a court order has been obtained.

If the landlord has not notified the former tenant of this claim and the amount due within this period, the landlord will be precluded from making a claim against him.

#### Liability for Variations

The [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 18](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/18) states that former tenants and guarantors are not liable to pay any additional amounts owing in respect of variations which have been made to the lease subsequent to assignment which they could not have anticipated at the time when the lease was entered into.

```ad-example
The former tenant who is still liable for the rent under an old lease or under an authorised guarantee agreement will still be liable for rent which is reviewed after assignment pursuant to the rent review clause in the original lease. Such a variation was anticipated at the time when the lease was entered into.
```

#### Overriding Leases

The [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995, s 19](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/30/section/19) provides for the creation of an overriding lease in certain circumstances.

A former tenant who has been served with a s 17 notice and has made payment in full is entitled to call on the landlord to grant it an overriding lease (LTCA 1995, s 19(1)). If granted, the former tenant becomes the immediate landlord of the defaulting party.

```ad-defn
title: Overriding lease
An overriding lease is a concurrent lease of the premises demised by the first lease and makes the former tenant the immediate landlord of the defaulting tenant. It therefore gives the former tenant the right to forfeit the first lease to the defaulting tenant and/or exercise the landlord’s other remedies for non-payment of rent.
```

The overriding lease is granted for a term equal to the remaining term of the lease in question plus three days. It contains the same covenants as the lease in question (other than those covenants which are expressed to be personal). If the former tenant requests an overriding lease, the landlord is obliged to grant it within a reasonable time.

The former tenant is then better able to ensure the assignee’s compliance under the terms of the lease, or terminate the assignee’s lease and re-let the property, or assign the overriding lease to a more reliable tenant.

> [!summary]
> - The **LT(C)A 1995, ss 17 to 19** apply to all leases regardless of when they were created.
> - Under the **LT(C)A 1995, s 17**, if a landlord wishes to pursue a former tenant for a fixed charge, the landlord must serve notice of the potential claim on such a tenant within six months of the charge becoming due.
> - Under the **LT(C)A 1995, s 18,** former tenants are not liable in respect of variations which have been made to the lease which they could not have anticipated at the time when the lease was entered into.
> - Under the **LT(C)A 1995, s 19**, if a former tenant pays rent or other fixed charges pursuant to **s 17**, that former tenant may request from the landlord an overriding lease.
> - When he is granted an overriding lease, the former tenant is better able to ensure the assignee’s compliance under the terms of the lease, or terminate the assignee’s lease.

### Liability Between Head-landlord and Sub-tenant

No privity of estate exists between a head-landlord and a sub-tenant, although a contractual relationship will exist between them if the sub-tenant has entered into direct covenants with the head-landlord.

Irrespective of direct contractual liability, if the sub-tenant breaches a covenant in the head-lease, the head-landlord will have the right to forfeit the head-lease, and this will mean that the sub-lease which is derived out of the head-lease will also terminate.

## Determination of Leases

A lease is created when one person with an estate in land (the Landlord) grants the temporary right to another person (the Tenant) to use and enjoy that land exclusively.

The different ways a lease can end:

- Effluxion of time
- Notice to quit
- Merger
- Forfeiture
- Break Clause
- Surrender

### By Effluxion of Time

This is the usual common law way in which a lease for a fixed term comes to an end. No notice is needed to end a fixed term. Note, however, that at the end of the lease, the tenant may have security of tenure. Security of tenure is a right for a tenant to remain in the premises at the end of the lease term and to request the grant of a new lease.

```ad-example
Many **business tenancies** are protected by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, Part II. If the tenant follows certain procedures and time limits, he may be entitled to require the landlord to grant him a new lease.

A **residential tenant** may have rights to remain in occupation under the Rent Act 1977 (for private tenancies granted before 15 January 1989) or the Housing Acts 1985 (public sector tenancies) and 1988 (private tenancies granted after 15 January 1989). Since the introduction of assured shorthold tenancies (ASTs) it is now very rare for a residential tenant to have security of tenure.
```

### By a ‘break’ Clause

A lease for a fixed term may contain a provision allowing either party (landlord or tenant or both) to serve notice during its currency to bring it to a premature end. The terms of a break clause must be strictly complied with if the exercise of it is to be valid.

```ad-example
“Either party may end this lease on the fifth anniversary of the term start date by serving 6 months written notice on the other.”
```

### By Surrender

A surrender is the handing back of the lease by the tenant to the (immediate) landlord with the landlord’s consent. This results in premature termination of the lease. The lease is said to merge into the landlord's reversion and is extinguished. To be legal, surrender must be by deed (s 52 LPA 1925).

### Merger

This is the converse of surrender; the tenant acquires the (immediate) landlord’s reversion interest, thus becoming his own landlord, and the lease is absorbed by the reversion and destroyed. Can also happen where a third party acquires both the lease and the reversion.

A deed of surrender is often entered into in practice to document the agreement. Sometimes a surrender premium will be paid by the tenant to the landlord too.

### Notice to Quit

This is the method for determining a periodic tenancy.

For a yearly tenancy, either side must give at least half a year’s notice to quit to determine the tenancy. Other periodic tenancies, for example quarterly, monthly or weekly, must be determined by a full period’s notice to expire at the end of a complete period.

```ad-defn
A periodic tenancy is a lease that runs from one period of time to another. Each period is seen as an individual lease.
```

### Forfeiture

This is a right for the landlord to terminate the lease prematurely for breach of covenant by the tenant. Also known as a ‘legal right of re-entry’ and a recognised legal interest in the land: [LPA 1925, s 1(2)(e)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1).

## Landlord's Remedies for Breach

### Non-payment of Rent

Landlord may consider the following remedies:

- Debt action
	- The tenant can be sued on his covenant to pay rent.
	- A landlord can only recover six years’ arrears: [Limitation Act 1980, s 19](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/19).
	- However, if a tenant is unable to pay the rent, it is unlikely to be able to pay any damages awarded by the court.
- Forfeiture
- Commercial rent arrears recovery procedure
- Collecting rent from a subtenant.
	- Possible under s 81 Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.
	- If CRAR is available to a landlord, landlord may serve notice on any sub-tenant setting out prescribed information including the amount due
	- Once 14 clear days have expired, the right to collect rent under the sublease transfers to the landlord, until any amount owing by the immediate tenant is paid off.
- Bankruptcy and winding up
	- If debt exceeds £5,000 (individual) or £750 (company), statutory demand can be served.
- Pursuing former tenants (if they remain liable)
- Pursuing guarantors of the tenant.

Commercial Rent (Coronavirus) Act 2022 binding arbitration process put in place to resolve claims for rent arrears accrued during periods of enforced closure (“protected rent debt”) supported by a voluntary code.

#### Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery Procedure

Distress was an ancient common law self-help remedy, entitling a landlord to enter the premises as soon as the rent was due and unpaid and to take possession of goods to the value of the rent owed.

If the tenant did not pay within five days, the goods could be sold.

Since the Human Rights Act 1998, concerns had been raised in cases and academic commentary as to whether the self-help remedy of distress was in breach of:

- Article 6: right to a fair trial
- Article 8: respect for private and family life and the home.
- Article 1 (Protocol 1): peaceful enjoyment of possessions.

From 6 April 2014, a landlord's right to levy distress for rent arrears was therefore abolished and replaced with a new regime known as **Commercial Rent Arrears Recovery.**

This requires a landlord to serve an enforcement notice on the tenant, giving **seven clear days’ notice** that he will seize goods. Once notice has been served, the tenant can apply for it to be set aside or for its execution to be delayed.

```ad-warning
There must be a minimum of seven days' rent arrears in order to use this procedure, and the remedy is not available in respect of mixed use or residential premises.
```

The notice requirements clearly reduce the effectiveness of the remedy from a landlord's perspective because tenants have the opportunity to remove goods from the premises and put them out of the landlord's reach.

Restrictions on using CRAR procedure:

- Applies to leases of commercial premises only.
	- Cannot be used if any part of the premises is let or occupied as a welling (except where this occurs in breach of a term of the lease).
	- Cannot be used where the lease is oral.
- Only available in relation to **pure rent arrears** (excluding service charge/ insurance rent) and at least 7 days' rent must be outstanding.
- Landlord required to serve an enforcement notice on the defaulting tenant. On the expiry of that notice, only an enforcement agent will be able to enter the premises to remove goods. Part 2 Taking Control of Goods Regulations 2013: information the enforcement notice must contain and how it must be given.
- s 78 TCEA 2007: tenant who receives an enforcement notice may apply to court for an order that the notice be set aside.
- Certain good exempt from CRAR and cannot be seized. Include items up to the value of £1,350 which are necessary for the tenant's business.
- Enforcement agent must give the tenant at least 7 days' clear notice of the sale of any seized goods.
- Any provision in a lease purporting to allow the seizure of goods for non-payment of rent, outside the CRAR procedure, will be void.

### Other Covenants

- Forfeiture
- Injunction
	- For breach of negative covenant or to prevent anticipated breach of covenant.
- Specific performance
	- Where the obligation to be enforced is sufficiently precise
	- Will not be ordered where performance or supervision is required over a period of time, or where damages are adequate.
- Damages
	- Recoverable under [[Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341]] principles.
- Pursue former tenants
- Pursue guarantors.

### Forfeiture

![[forfeiture_1.jpg]]

A lease is a proprietary right to possess the land. One way in which a lease can end early is if a landlord exercises a forfeiture right. This is a right for the landlord to terminate the lease prematurely for breach of covenant by the tenant. This is a very powerful right.

#### Legal Leases

There must be an express forfeiture clause in the lease allowing the landlord to forfeit the lease in the event of breach of covenant (or insolvency) by the tenant. Every well-drawn lease should contain a forfeiture clause. The right to forfeit is never implied into a legal lease.

```ad-note
In a legal lease, the forfeiture clause creates a legal right of re-entry (one of the five legal rights listed in LPA 1925, s 1(2)). A forfeiture clause is therefore also known as a re-entry clause.
```

#### Equitable Leases

There does not need to be an express forfeiture clause, because a right to forfeit for non-payment of rent is implied into equitable leases as one of the implied usual covenants.

#### Exercising the Right

Forfeiture is exercised by the landlord by either:

- peaceably re-entering the property; or
- by obtaining a court order.

There are then different rules, depending on whether the landlord is forfeiting for non-payment of rent or for breach of covenant other than non-payment of rent. However, the methods of forfeiture described above (court order or peaceable re-entry) apply to both types of breach.

In the case of pure business premises the landlord may forfeit by peaceable re-entry i.e., by physically entering, changing the locks and putting up an unequivocal notice that he is forfeiting the lease.

Where the premises are residential, the landlord cannot forfeit without a court order: Protection from Eviction Act 1977, s 2. This includes where the premises are mixed residential and commercial: [[Patel v Pirabakaran [2006] 1 WLR 3112]].

The ability to forfeit residential tenancies is restricted by Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. Whether the property is commercial or residential, it is an offence to use or threaten violence (s 6 Criminal Law Act 1977) to achieve re-entry.

#### Forfeiture Procedure

1. Has there been a breach?
2. Is there a forfeiture clause?
3. Has there been a waiver?

The rules relating to waiver apply to breach of rent covenants and breach of other types of covenant.

#### 3. Waiver

If the landlord wishes to forfeit, he must not have waived his right to forfeit. The landlord may waive the right to forfeit if:

- he is aware of the acts or omissions giving rise to the right to forfeit; and
- he does some unequivocal act recognising the continued existence of the lease.
	- Example: Demanding, accepting or suing for rent due after the breach; or distraining for rent due, despite knowing about the breach.

Waiver can take place **inadvertently**.

For example, the landlord’s agent sends out a rent demand where the landlord (though not the agent) is aware of the breach ([[Central Estates (Belgravia) Ltd v Woolgar [1972] 1 WLR 1048]]).

Where there is a **continuing** breach (e.g., failure to repair), waiver only lasts until the next day the breach continues, at which point the landlord can then choose to reject the rent and forfeit the lease.

If the breach is **non-continuing** ('once and for all'), such as sub-letting without consent, waiver is permanent, i.e., once rent is accepted the landlord can never again forfeit for that specific breach.

Waiver operates only on the landlord’s right to forfeit. The landlord retains other remedies, such as an action for debt or damages.

Note that waiver can operate in relation to a breach of covenant to pay the rent; the landlord could for example waive the right to forfeit for failure to pay the previous month’s rent, by demanding the next month’s rent.

Non-payment of rent is classified as a non-continuing breach ([[London and County (A&D) Ltd v Wilfred Sportsman Ltd [1971] Ch 764]]).

This means that each individual non-payment of rent (i.e., each missed payment) is deemed to be a separate breach, creating a separate right to forfeit.

So, even if the landlord permanently waives his right to forfeit for one incidence of non-payment of rent, this does not preclude the possibility that the landlord could forfeit for another non-payment of rent in the future (which is a likely possibility in such circumstances).

## Breach of a Rent Covenant

A lease can end early if a landlord exercises a forfeiture right. This is a right for the landlord to terminate the lease prematurely for breach of covenant by the tenant. This is a very powerful right. There are then different rules depending on whether the landlord is forfeiting for non-payment of rent or for breach of covenant other than non-payment of rent.

If other payments due to the landlord are expressed in the lease to be paid as additional rent (e.g. service charges) the landlord can forfeit for non-payment in the same way as for rent.

Suppose there has been a breach of rent covenant, there is a forfeiture clause (either express or implied), and there is no relevant waiver. Step 4 is making a formal demand for the rent.

### 4. Formal Demand

The Landlord must first make a formal demand for the exact amount of rent due on the day when it becomes payable, upon the premises, between the hours of sunrise and sunset unless:

- The lease expressly waives this requirement. It usually does so by including in the forfeiture clause words such as ‘whether formally demanded or not’. Or;
- At least six months’ rent is in arrears and there are insufficient distrainable (i.e., seizable) goods on the premises to satisfy all the arrears due (Common Law Procedure Act 1852, s 210).

### 5: Exercise the Right

Once the landlord has made a formal demand, or if a formal demand is not necessary, the landlord can proceed to forfeit by court order or peaceable re-entry as described above.

### 6: Relief

The tenant may then apply for relief from forfeiture. 'Relief' means the court’s discretion to allow the lease to continue and thereby end the forfeiture process. This discretion to grant relief is an ancient equitable jurisdiction, but is now enshrined in various statutes, as explained below.

#### Before the Court Order

If, on the landlord’s suing for possession, the tenant pays into court all arrears and costs before the trial, all further proceedings are stayed.

The legal authority for this depends upon whether the proceedings are in the County Court or High Court:

- County Courts Act 1984, s 138, in the county court;
- Common Law Procedure Act 1852, s 212 in the High Court, provided in the High Court that at least six months’ rent is in arrears ([[Standard Pattern Co Ltd v Ivey [1962] Ch 432]]).

#### At or After the Court Order

The court has a discretion to grant relief, i.e., to allow the lease to continue on condition that the arrears are paid.

Relief is usually given unless the circumstances are exceptional, for example:

- Where the property has already been lawfully let to a new tenant after the forfeiture ([[Stanhope v Haworth (1886) 3 TLR 34]].)
- Where the non-payment of rent is exceptionally bad. No relief was given in [[Public Trustee v Westbrook [1965] 1 WLR 1160]] where no rent had been paid for 22 years, as the site was bombed out and everyone thought that the lease had ended.

When the landlord has re-entered under a court order, the application for relief must be made within **six months** of re-entry (see Common Law Procedure Act 1852, s 210 in the High Court. Similar but slightly different provisions apply in the county court under the County Courts Act 1984.)

After peaceable re-entry if the landlord forfeits a non-residential lease without a court order (or if less than six months’ rent is in arrears), the court has an inherent equitable jurisdiction to grant relief if:

- the rent and landlord’s costs are paid; and
- it is just and equitable to grant relief.

[[Thatcher v Pearce [1968] 1 WLR 748]] – A lease of a scrapyard was determined by peaceable re-entry by the landlord while the tenant was in prison. The tenant applied more than six months after forfeiture for relief and was successful.

#### Sub-tenant

If a head-lease is forfeited, any sub-lease will also be destroyed. A sub-tenant in the premises has the right to apply for relief from forfeiture.

The authority:

- Under [CCA 1984, s 138](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/28/section/138) (county court action);
- [SCA 1981, s 38](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/38) (High Court action);
- [LPA 1925, s 146(4)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/146) (peaceable re-entry).

This is the case even where the head-tenant cannot get relief himself. The court has the power to vest the head-lease in the sub-tenant on such terms as it sees fit, including rent, but cannot grant the sub-tenant a lease for any longer than the term of the original sub-lease.

In summary, under the above provisions, the court usually allows the lease to continue on condition that the tenant pays off the arrears.

```ad-summary
**Step 1:** There must be a breach of covenant.

**Step 2:** There must be a forfeiture clause in the lease.

**Step 3:** The landlord must not have waived the right to forfeit: distinguish here between a continuing and non-continuing breach.

**Breach of rent covenant:**

**Step 4:** The landlord must have served a demand for payment, or the lease must waive this right.

**Step 5:** The landlord can then forfeit the lease for the breach of covenant by peaceable re-entry or court order. However, if the tenancy is residential, the landlord must obtain a court order.

**Step 6:** The tenant, and any sub-tenant, can apply for relief from forfeiture. Relief is the court's discretion to allow the lease to continue. Relief can be applied for regardless of whether the right has been exercised by court order or peaceable re-entry.
```

![[forfeiture-rent.png]]

## Breach of Other Covenants

### Step 4: S 146 Notice

In cases other than non-payment of rent, before the landlord can forfeit they must first serve notice upon the tenant under [LPA 1925, s 146](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/146).

This notice must:

- Specify the breach complained of.
- If capable of remedy, require it to be remedied within a reasonable time.
	- Breaches which are capable of remedy include continuing breaches, for example failure to repair or unauthorised use.
	- What is a reasonable time? This depends upon the nature of the breach. Some textbooks suggest three months as a rule of thumb.
	- If capable of remedy and the tenant does not remedy the breach within a reasonable time, the landlord may proceed to forfeit either by peaceable re-entry or by obtaining a court order (this is compulsory in a residential case).
	- If the breach is not capable of remedy, the landlord must merely give the tenant enough time to consider his position, for example 14 days, before proceeding to forfeit ([[Scala House and District Property Co Ltd v Forbes]].)
- Require the lessee to make compensation in money for the breach if the landlord requires such compensation.
	- The landlord does not have to request compensation if he does not want it ([[Rugby School (Governors) v Tannahill [1935] 1 KB 87]]).

```ad-note
The law is unclear as to whether a s 146 notice needs to be served for non-payment of sums like service charge and insurance rent, where these sums are reserved as rent in the lease. 
```

#### Illegal or Immoral Use

Although Greer LJ did not think that the breach of an illegal or immoral use covenant was capable of remedy in the 1930s, more recent case law has been more flexible in its approach, and it now seems that it depends on the facts of the case as to whether an illegal or immoral use covenant is capable of remedy, as per Harman J in [[Van Haarlam v Kasner [1992] 64 P & CR 214]].

It was also held in [[Glass v Kencakes [1966] 1 QB 611]] that such breaches are capable of remedy if the lessee did not know of the illegal or immoral use by a subtenant, as long as the lessee takes immediate steps to stop the use, including forfeiting the sublease within a reasonable time.

Further, even if the breach is incapable of remedy, relief from forfeiture is still possible in the case of immoral use (see [[Ropemaker Properties v Noonhaven [1989] 2 EGLR 50]], where the immoral use had ceased).

In the case of illegal use (in Van Haarlam), the judge said, obiter, that he would have given relief from forfeiture if there had not been waiver, because forfeiture of the lease was out of proportion to the offence.

In [[Expert Clothing (Services and Sales) Ltd v Hillgate House Ltd [1986] Ch 340]], the House of Lords established the test for assessing whether a breach of covenant is capable or incapable of remedy:

> the ultimate question for the court was this: if the section 146 notice had required the lessee to remedy the breach and the lessors had then allowed a reasonable time to elapse to enable the lessee fully to comply with the relevant covenant, would such compliance, coupled with the payment of any appropriate monetary compensation, have effectively remedied the harm which the lessors had suffered or were likely to suffer from the breach? If, but only if, the answer to this question was "No," would the failure of the section 146 notice to require remedy of the breach have been justifiable.

This approach was approved by the Court of Appeal in [[Savva v Hussein (1997) 73 P&CR 150]], stating that the same approach was also relevant to negative covenants.

#### Breach of Repair Covenants

[Leasehold Property (Repairs) Act 1938](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/1-2/34/contents) (LP(R)A 1938) applies to a covenant to repair in any lease (except an agricultural holding) when the lease is granted for at least seven years and there are **at least three years still to run**.

Where the Act applies and the landlord seeks either forfeiture or damages for breach of a repairing covenant, the s 146 notice (in addition to the usual requirements) must inform the tenant of his right under the 1938 Act to **serve a counter notice within 28 days**. If the tenant serves a counter-notice, the landlord cannot proceed to claim forfeiture or damages without first obtaining the leave of the court.

The effect of the Act is to limit severely the landlord’s ability to enforce a repairing obligation until the last three years of the lease.

##### Damages

**s 18 LTA 1927**: damages for the breach of a tenant's repairing covenant are capped at the reduction in the value of the landlord's reversion caused by the breach. This weeds out a lot of claims.

If the provisions of LP(R)A 1938 apply to the lease, the landlord must serve a s 146 notice on the tenant **even if the landlord is not seeking to forfeit** and this must contain a statement of the tenant's right to serve a counter-notice within 28 days. If the tenant serves this notice, the landlord can proceed with the claim only with the leave of the court.

##### Internal Decorative Repair

Where the landlord serves notice under LPA 1925, s 146 and the notice relates to internal decorative repairs, the tenant may apply to the court and be wholly or partially relieved of liability to the extent that the court thinks the notice unreasonable (LPA 1925, s 147). Section 147 does not apply to certain covenants, such as to put into decorative repair at the start of a lease, to yield up in a specified state of repair at the end of a lease or to any provision for the maintenance of the structure, amongst others. — **don't care.**

##### Self-help

The limitations can be circumvented with a self-help clause in the lease. This allows the landlord to enter the premises and carry out the repairs if the tenant has failed to comply, and the tenant must then pay the landlord's costs for the repairs.

```ad-important
These costs are recoverable as a **debt**, not **damages** ([[Jervis v Harris [1996] Ch 195]] or lease clause), though best to specify explicitly in the lease too) $\implies$ L will be pursuing for non-payment of a debt, not T's failure to repair $\implies$ LP(R)A 1938 & s 18 LTA 19927 limitations can be avoided. 
```

##### Specific Performance?

In [[Rainbow Estates Ltd v Tokenhold Ltd [1999] Ch 64]], the court held that in principle there is no reason why the equitable remedy of specific performance should not be used to enforce compliance by tenant with its repair covenant. However, other remedies (e.g. damages and self-help) are likely to be more appropriate and the court stressed that specific performance will only be awarded in exceptional circumstances.

##### Conclusion

Most breaches are now technically capable of remedy provided the mischief can be put right by making full recompense to the landlord, leaving the landlord with no lasting damage. However, it is still probably the case that breach of a covenant against assignment or sub-letting, and possibly immoral or illegal use, is technically not capable of remedy. This was all confirmed in an obiter discussion by Neuberger LJ in [[Akici v LR Butlin [2006] 1 WLR 201]].

#### Step 5: Exercise the Right

Once the landlord has correctly served a LPA 1925, s 146 notice, the landlord can proceed to forfeit by court order or peaceable re-entry as described above.

If the tenant does not remedy the breach within a reasonable time, the landlord may proceed to forfeit either by peaceable re-entry or by obtaining a court order, which is compulsory in a residential case.

If the breach is not capable of remedy, the landlord must merely give the tenant enough time to consider his position, for example 14 days, before proceeding to forfeit ([[Scala House and District Property Co Ltd v Forbes]]).

#### Step 6: Relief

The tenant may then apply for relief from forfeiture. 'Relief' means the court’s discretion to allow the lease to continue and thereby end the forfeiture process. This discretion to grant relief is an ancient equitable jurisdiction, but is now enshrined in various statutes, as explained below.

```ad-statute
title: s 146(2) LPA 1925
Where a lessor is proceeding, by action or otherwise, to enforce such a right of re-entry or forfeiture, the lessee may, in the lessor’s action, if any, or in any action brought by himself, apply to the court for relief; and the court may grant or refuse relief, as the court, having regard to the proceedings and conduct of the parties under the foregoing provisions of this section, and to all the other circumstances, thinks fit; and in case of relief may grant it on such terms, if any, as to costs, expenses, damages, compensation, penalty, or otherwise, including the granting of an injunction to restrain any like breach in the future, as the court, in the circumstances of each case, thinks fit.
```

LPA 1925, s 146(2) provides that, where the landlord is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce forfeiture, the tenant may in the landlord’s action, or in any action brought by himself, apply to the court for relief.

The court may grant or refuse relief as the court, having regard to all the circumstances, thinks fit.

Therefore, in cases of breach of covenants other than rent, the tenant applies for relief under LPA 1925, s 146(2).

It generally depends on how wilful and blatant the breach was, the gravity of the breach, the landlord’s motives for wanting forfeiture, the damage to the premises and whether the breach can be put right. Relief is usually given on condition that the breach is remedied and that the tenant undertakes not to breach the covenant again.

| [[Billson v Residential Apartments Ltd [1992] 1 AC 494 1]]          | The House of Lords focused on the granting of relief from forfeiture to a tenant, where the forfeiture is for breach of a covenant other than a covenant to pay rent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The judicial dislike of peaceable re-entry as a method of forfeiture is apparent from Lord Templeman’s judgment in Billson v Residential Apartments. If a landlord is going to forfeit a lease, following the issue of a s146 notice, using this method rather than obtaining a court order, the tenant may still apply for relief within a reasonable time after the landlord’s peaceable re-entry. This is in contrast to the finality of an executed court order, where **no further relief application is available**.

##### Subtenant’s Right to Relief for Non-rent Breaches

LPA 1925, s 146(4) allows a subtenant to apply to the court for relief against forfeiture for breach of other covenants. It is a matter of discretion whether a subtenant will be granted relief. An unlawful subtenant (where no consent was given for the subletting) is unlikely to get relief ([[St Marylebone Property Co v Tesco Stores Ltd [1988] 2 EGLR 40]]). The House of Lords’ interpretation of s 146(2) in Billson must surely apply equally to s 146(4), so that a subtenant must apply for relief within a reasonable time after peaceable re-entry.

```ad-summary
**Step 1:** There must be a breach of covenant.

**Step 2:** There must be a forfeiture clause in the lease.

**Step 3:** The landlord must not have waived the right to forfeit: distinguish here between a continuing and non-continuing breach.

**Breach of a non rent covenant:**

**Step 4:** The landlord must have served a LPA 1925, s 146 Notice.

(Does the breach relate to a repair covenant? Consider does the additional protection under **LP(R)A 1938 or LPA 1925, s 147** apply?)

**Step 5:** The landlord can then forfeit the lease for the breach of covenant by peaceable re-entry or court order. However, if the tenancy is residential, the landlord must obtain a court order.

**Step 6:** The tenant, and any sub-tenant, can apply for relief from forfeiture. Relief is the court's discretion to allow the lease to continue. Relief can be applied for regardless of whether the right has been exercised by court order or peaceable re-entry.
