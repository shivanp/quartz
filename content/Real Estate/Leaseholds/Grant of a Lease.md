# Grant of a Lease

## Lease Types

- Short residential lettings
	- Tenancy usually presented as “take it or leave it”
	- Governed by statute (Housing Act 1988)
	- For residential leases under 7 years, landlords may be required to check the immigration status of prospective tenants.
- Long residential lease
	- Lease granted on terms stipulated by the landlord.
- Commercial lease
	- Parties usually agree terms of the lease and proceed directly to grant (rather than having an exchange of contracts stage).

## Taking Instructions From the Landlord

Before drafting the lease, the landlord's solicitor should investigate their own client's title:

- Ensures the client is entitled to grant the lease and to anticipate any problems with the title (e.g., covenants preventing a particular use).
- Consider if any mortgage over the property restricts the landlord's ability to grant a lease over the property.

The draft lease is sent to the tenant's solicitor for negotiation and approval.

## Drafting Contract

Where a contract for the grant of lease is to be entered into, this is also drafted by the landlord's solicitor.

- Particulars of sale should give details of the term vested in the tenant.
- Incumbrances affecting freehold title must be disclosed.;
- Contract should provide for an indemnity to be given in respect of future breaches of any covenants affecting the title.
- Except where the lease is for a term $\leq 3$ years, taking effect in possession and with no premium payable for its grant, the contract for the lease must satisfy s 2 LP(MP)A 1989.
- SCPC 11.2.3: the lease will be in the form annexed to the draft contract. The landlord will engross the lease and supply the tenant with the engrossment $\geq 5$ working days before completion.

## Pre-contract Package

The landlord's solicitor should provide the tenant's solicitor with:

- Draft contract
- Draft lease
- Evidence of freehold title
- Copies of relevant planning consents
- Evidence of lender's consent to the grant of the lease.

Where the Protocol is used, the landlord’s solicitor will adopt the terms of that scheme in the  
same way as would be the case for the sale of freehold land. So a Property Information Form (TA06) and Fittings and Contents Form (TA10) would be included as part of the pre-contract package.

In the case of the grant of a flat lease where there is going to be a management company providing the services, the company will need incorporating and share certificates (if relevant) and company documents will need to be prepared before the completion of the sale of the first flat.

### Energy and Efficiency

From 1 October 2008, subject to certain limited exceptions (for example temporary buildings which are intended to be used for no more than two years), Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are required whenever a building is constructed, sold or rented out. The general rule is that an EPC is valid for 10 years unless a new EPC is issued to replace it.

From April 2018, landlords of certain domestic or non-domestic buildings will not be able to grant new tenancies (or renew existing ones) unless the building being let has an EPC rating of at least E.

## Acting for the Tenant

### Draft Contract and Lease

When parties enter into a contract before grant, the contract will normally require the tenant to accept the draft lease in the form annexed to the contract (SCPC 11.2.3).

### Searches

Searches usually done by the tenant's solicitor. The landlord's solicitor may do some searches and supply these as part of the pre-contract package.

### Lender's Requirements

Where the tenant is acquiring the lease with the aid of a mortgage, the Lenders’ Handbook requires compliance with the following conditions:

1. the consent of the landlord’s lender has been obtained to the transaction (where relevant);
2. the length of the term to be granted provides adequate security for the loan (terms of less than 60 years are often unacceptable for mortgage purposes in the case of residential leases);
3. the lease contains adequate insurance provisions relating both to the premises themselves and (where relevant) to common parts of the building, and the insurance provisions coincide with the lender’s own requirements for insurance;
4. title to the freehold reversion is deduced, enabling the lease itself to be registered with an absolute title at Land Registry;
5. the lease contains proper repairing covenants in respect both of the property itself and (where relevant) the common parts of the building;
6. in the case of residential leases, that there is no provision for forfeiture on the insolvency of the tenant.

## Engrossment and Execution

The lease is normally prepared in two identical parts, the lease and counterpart. The lease is executed by the landlord and the counterpart by the tenant. On completion, these are exchanged so that each party has a copy of the lease signed by the other in case of subsequent dispute.

- SCPC 11.2.5 provides that it is for the landlord’s solicitor to prepare the engrossments.
- If the landlord requires the tenant to pay a fee for the preparation of the engrossment, this must be dealt with by special condition in the contract.
- The landlord will sign the lease itself in readiness for completion, and the counterpart should be sent to the tenant’s solicitor **$\geq 5$ working days** before contractual completion date (SCPC 11.2.5) for execution by the tenant.

## Apportionment of Rent

Rent is usually paid in advance, not in arrears. Unless completion takes place on a day when rent under the lease falls due, a proportionate amount of rent from completion to the rent payment date is payable by the tenant on completion. Either deal with this in the lease or by express special condition.

## Completion

The landlord will receive:

- The counterpart lease executed by the tenant.
- Any premium payable for the grant (less deposit paid on exchange of contracts)
- Apportioned sum representing rent payable in advance under the lease.

The landlord should give:

- Lease executed by landlord
- Certified copy of the consent of the landlord's lender to the transaction (where applicable).

## Post-completion

### Registration

- Short lease
	- Legal lease $\leq 7$ years takes effect as an overriding interest under LRA 2002.
	- Voluntary notice of a lease $3 < L \leq 7$ can be placed in the charges register.
- Registrable lease
	- $L >7$: lease is registrable. Registered with its own separate title and title number.

The lease must be registered at Land Registry within the relevant priority period or, on first registration, within two months of completion of the grant of the lease. If the freehold is itself registered, the tenant’s application is for registration of a dealing. Where the landlord’s title is registered, the lease will be noted against the reversionary title.

### SDLT

A land transaction return must be submitted to HMRC on the grant of a lease. SDLT is potentially chargeable on any capital sum paid (“premium” of a lease) and the amount of the rent. SDLT on any rental element is based on the Net Present Value of the rent (use a 3.5%/pa discount rate on future cash flows).

#### Residential Property

The SDLT payable on any premium is calculated on the same basis as for the consideration on the sale of freehold land. SDLT is charged at 1% on any element of the NPV that exceeds £125,000.

#### Non-residential Property

SDLT payable on any premium is calculated on the same basis as for the consideration on the sale of freehold land. SDLT is chargeable on the NPV as follows:

| Net present value of rent      | SDLT rate |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| $£0 \leq P \leq £150,000$      | $0$       |
| $£150,000 < P \leq £5,000,000$ | $1 \%$    |
| $P > £5,000,000$               | $2 \%$    |

### Notice to Landlord

Para 5.13.13 of the Lender’s Handbook requires notice of a mortgage to be served on the landlord and the management company (if any). Notice should be given by sending two copies of the notice, together with a cheque for the appropriate fee, to the landlord’s solicitor or other person named in the covenant. One copy of the notice should be placed with the landlord’s title deeds, the other should be receipted on behalf of the landlord and returned to the tenant’s solicitor.
