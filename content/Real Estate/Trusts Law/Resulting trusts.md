# Resulting trusts

## Terminology

An express trust is one which is deliberately created.

Unlike express trusts, resulting and constructive trusts arise by operation of law. In other words, they are imposed by the courts. You will also see these described as ‘implied trusts’. In this module we prefer the term ‘trusts arising by operation of law’ as it is wide enough to include statutory trusts.

Resulting trusts are so named because property is held on trust for the person who transferred it or contributed to its acquisition. The equitable interest ‘results’ back to the transferor or contributor. Conventionally, they arise in three situations:

1. Where a transfer on trust wholly or partially fails, but the property has been transferred to the trustee
2. Where a person gratuitously transfers property to another person
3. Where a person pays all or part of the purchase price for an asset

The trust in (1) is called an ‘automatic’ resulting trust. The trusts in (2) and (3) are called ‘presumed’ resulting trusts.

## Automatic Resulting Trusts

Automatic resulting trusts arise where there has been some sort of failure in the creation of a transfer on trust. They are effectively a default position which returns the beneficial interest to the settlor, giving them Saunders v Vautier rights and thus the ability to collapse the trust and either retain the property or re-attempt the intended express trust.

For example, resulting trusts will arise for A in each of the following circumstances:

- A transfers property to B intending B to hold it on trust but fails to properly identify the intended beneficiaries. The trust fails for uncertainty of objects.
- A transfers property to B intending B to hold it on trust for C and D but fails to specify their beneficial entitlements. The trust fails for uncertainty of subject matter.
- A transfers property to B intending B to hold it for a non-charitable purpose which does not fall within a recognised exception to the beneficiary principle. The trust fails for non-compliance with the beneficiary principle.

```ad-important
It is important to note that not all failed attempts to create an express trust will produce a resulting trust. In particular, if the trust fails due to lack of constitution (i.e., legal title has not passed to the trustee) there is nothing to result back to the settlor. They already have the property. If an implied trust is to arise in this situation it will be a constructive trust which perfects the failed trust.

### Failure of Validly Created Trust

Even if a trust has been validly created, it may still fail subsequently. For example:

- A private express trust has run for the full 125-year statutory perpetuity period, and some of the trust property has still not vested in a beneficiary. There is no gift-over.
- The purpose of a non-charitable trust can no longer be carried out (e.g., the trust is for a pet that has died) but there are funds remaining and no gift-over.

In both cases, the property is held on a resulting trust for the settlor’s estate. It is also important to note that concluding that there is a problem with one of the three certainties does not necessarily mean there will be a resulting trust:

- A self-declaration of trust which fails for uncertainty of objects or subject matter will simply have no effect. The settlor will remain the full legal owner of the property.
- Similarly, a testamentary trust which fails for uncertainty of objects or subject matter will be void. The property will be treated as part of the testator’s residue.

If property is left to an individual in a will, and it is concluded that there is insufficient certainty as to whether they are intended to be a trustee, the effect of the provision will be a straightforward gift to that individual.

### Transfer to Third Party

The position is more complicated if the legal owner of property transfers that property to a third party during their lifetime, and it is concluded that there is no intention to create an express trust. If there is evidence that the transferor intended a gift, then that is the effect of the transfer. If there is no such evidence, it is likely that there will be a resulting trust, but it will be properly categorised as a presumed resulting trust.

## Presumed Resulting Trust

Presumed resulting trusts arise in situations where a transfer is gratuitous and there is no evidence that the transferor intended the recipient to receive the property as a gift. They arise by way of a presumption that the transferor or contributor intended to create a trust. The presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the transferor or contributor’s actual intention is inconsistent with the creation of a trust.

Consider a scenario where A transfers the legal title of an asset to B:

- If B provides consideration for the transfer, there is no presumption of resulting trust. The transaction is a sale.
- If B provides no consideration, there is a presumption of resulting trust. But if there is evidence that A intends to make a gift to B, the presumption will be easily rebutted and B will become the full legal owner of the property.
- If B provides no consideration and can adduce no evidence that A intended to make a gift, B will hold the asset on a resulting trust for A.

Another situation in which a presumed resulting trust will arise is where, rather than transferring an existing asset to someone else, a person pays all or part of the purchase price for a new asset.

Where the person pays the full purchase price, the analysis is very similar to the previous scenarios. For example, A purchases shares and has them registered in B’s name. As with the previous examples, B will hold the shares on resulting trust for A unless it can be shown that this was not A’s intention because, for example, B provided consideration or A demonstrated an intention to make a gift to B.

The analysis is more complicated in situations where the purchase price for an asset is provided by more than one person. There are two broad situations to consider here:

- A and B both contribute towards the purchase price of an asset, but B becomes the sole legal owner.
- A and B both contribute towards the purchase price of an asset. A contributes more than B, but they become joint legal owners of the asset.

Again, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a presumed resulting trust (sometimes described as a ‘purchase money resulting trust’) will determine A and B’s respective equitable interests. Regardless of how legal title is held, A and B will be treated as having equitable interests which reflect their respective contributions to the purchase price.

### Land

This scenario commonly arises in situations involving joint ownership of land. In order to understand the following examples, it is important to be aware that legal title to land can only be held (i) by a sole legal owner or (ii) by up to four legal owners as joint tenants.

This means that the legal ownership of the land may not reflect the intended beneficial ownership. Joint legal owners will therefore often hold the land on trust for themselves, with their equitable interests reflecting the true beneficial ownership of the land.

It is preferable to declare an express trust over the land which makes the [[beneficial entitlement]] clear. In the absence of an express trust, an implied trust may arise to determine the equitable ownership of the land.

It is important to note that presumed resulting trusts are not used to determine [[beneficial entitlement]] to land acquired jointly as a family home. Such cases involve the use of common intention constructive trusts.

```ad-example
A and B each contribute half of the purchase price for land, and B is registered as the sole legal owner. There is no evidence A intends a gift to B. No express trust is declared. B holds the land on trust for A and B as tenants in common in equal shares.
```

```ad-example
A contributes 70% and B contributes 30% of the purchase price. They are registered as joint legal owners. They do not discuss how the property should be shared, and no express trust is declared. A and B hold the land as legal joint tenants on trust for A and B as equitable tenants in common. A has a 70% equitable share and B has a 30% equitable share.
```

```ad-summary
- Resulting trusts involve the return of a beneficial interest to the original legal owner of property or contributor to that property.
- Automatic resulting trusts are default trusts which arise when property is vested in an intended trustee but the trust fails, either from the outset or subsequently.
- Common reasons for an automatic resulting trust to arise include uncertainty of subject matter, uncertainty of objects, non-compliance with the beneficiary principle or a surplus fund remaining at the end of the trust period.
- A presumption of resulting trust arises where a person either transfers property to another person or contributes towards the acquisition of an asset for the benefit of another person. The presumption can be rebutted by evidence of the actual intention.
- Where A transfers an asset to (or purchases an asset for) B, B will hold that asset on resulting trust for A unless there is evidence that this was not A’s intention.
- If A and B jointly contribute towards the purchase price of an asset, regardless of how legal title is held, they will each gain an equitable interest which reflects their respective contributions unless there is evidence of a contrary intention.
