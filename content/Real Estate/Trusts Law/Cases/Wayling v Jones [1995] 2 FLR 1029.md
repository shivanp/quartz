# Wayling v Jones [1995] 2 FLR 1029

FACTS: The claimant’s boyfriend (D) owned a hotel. D asked the claimant, a trained chef, to help him run the hotel. And D assured the claimant that he would give him the hotel by his will. The claimant worked very hard for four years making a success of the hotel. He was paid ‘little more than pocket money.’ On D’s death, the hotel was inherited by his relatives. The claimant brought a proprietary estoppel claim against D’s estate.

During cross-examination, the claimant stated that he would have worked in the hotel even if D had not made the assurance because D needed him and because he loved D. The trial judge held that this was fatal to the proprietary estoppel claim because it demonstrated that the claimant’s detriment was not reliant on D’s assurance.

HELD: The Court of Appeal allowed the claimant’s appeal. It reasoned that since D had made the assurance, the only relevant question was what the claimant would have done if D had told him that he had changed his mind. During his evidence in chief, this question had been put to the claimant, who answered that he would have left D and stopped working in the hotel. On the strength of this answer, the court held that the claimant had relied on D’s assurance. Leggatt LJ said: ‘it was because the plaintiff relied on the promise that he would have left if he had learned that it was not going to be kept.’ The Court of Appeal awarded the claimant the proceeds from the sale of the hotel.

A claim was made against a deceased's estate by his former partner, W, claiming that W had been promised property by the deceased. Relying on this W had lived with the deceased and worked for him for mere pocket money. This claim was dismissed, and W appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that for a claim such as this in proprietary estoppel to succeed it must be shown that one party had made promises which the other had relied on to his detriment. The fact that W had worked for next to nothing showed that he had acted to his detriment in reliance on the deceased's promises.
