# Re Beatty [1990] 1 WLR 1503

## Abstract

Clauses in a will conferring on trustees fiduciary powers of appointment were held to be valid. By cl.3 of her will the testatrix bequeathed her personal chattels to trustees, stating that they shall "…distribute the chattels…among such persons as they think fit within two years of her death." She requested the trustees to give effect to her wishes, but not so as to create a trust or legal obligation. By cl.4 she bequeathed a legacy of GBP 1.5m in similar terms. During the two years following her death they bequeathed GBP 150,000 in chattels and GBP 1.2m. The residuary beneficiaries challenged the distributions. The trustees applied to determine the validity of the clauses.

Held, that the clauses conferred on the trustees fiduciary powers of appointment which would have been valid if created by deed; there was no rule of law invalidating the powers merely because they were in a will _[Park, Re [1932] 1 Ch. 580, [1931] 11 WLUK 59](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I19DD4FD0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6e0cd2f4be484e69b442def6d2e00bd6&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Abrahams Will Trusts, Re [1969] 1 Ch. 463, [1967] 5 WLUK 55](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I47B67BD1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6e0cd2f4be484e69b442def6d2e00bd6&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
