# Re James [1935] Ch 449

On the death of his father, J handed over the furniture and title deeds of a certain house and premises, forming part of his fatherâ€™s estate, to S and allowed her to occupy the house rent free. J died intestate, and S was appointed as administratrix. The Chancery Division held that there was a continuing intention on the part of the donor up to the time of his death to give the property to the donee, and by her appointment as an administratrix she had acquired the legal estate.
