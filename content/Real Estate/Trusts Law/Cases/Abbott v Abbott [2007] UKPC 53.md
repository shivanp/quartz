# Abbott v Abbott [2007] UKPC 53

## Summary

In determining the beneficial ownership of a former matrimonial home, the Court of Appeal of Antigua and Barbuda had erred by attaching undue significance to the dictum of Lord Bridge in _[Lloyds Bank Plc v Rosset [1991] 1 A.C. 107, [1990] 3 WLUK 428](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE21B0510E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fd0519e4e0a5402789d05c866ce1106a&contextData=(sc.Default))_. The law had moved on since then, and the parties' whole course of conduct in relation to a property had to be taken into account in determining their intentions as to its ownership.

## Abstract

The appellant wife (W) appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal of Antigua and Barbuda allowing an appeal by the respondent husband (H) against a decision regarding the beneficial ownership of the parties' former matrimonial home, its furniture, and some shares.

The parties had married in 1983. In 1984, H's mother transferred a plot of land into H's name, so that the parties could build their matrimonial home there. The home was built in 1990 and 1991, and H was the legal owner. H's mother contributed towards the construction costs, but H and W also took out a bridging loan and then a mortgage. W made herself jointly and severally liable for the repayment of the principal and interest on the mortgage. Throughout the marriage, H and W's income went into a joint bank account, and all payments were made out of that joint account. W did not work between 1986 and 1995. The parties separated in 1996 and, after a brief reconciliation in 1997, they commenced divorce proceedings in 1999. The trial judge held that H and W had an equal beneficial interest in the matrimonial home, given that they were both liable for repaying the mortgage and there was no reason to believe that H's mother wanted to make a gift of the land to H alone. The Court of Appeal held that there was no factual basis for the inference that the land was a gift to both H and W, and took the view, relying on _[Lloyds Bank Plc v Rosset [1991] 1 A.C. 107, [1990] 3 WLUK 428](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE21B0510E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fd0519e4e0a5402789d05c866ce1106a&contextData=(sc.Default))_, that W could only acquire an interest by way of direct contributions to the mortgage payments. Accordingly, it held that W was only entitled to an 8.31 per cent share in the equity, based on her actual contributions towards the mortgage.

## Held

Appeal allowed in part.

(1) The Court of Appeal should not have interfered with the trial judge's findings on the beneficial ownership of the matrimonial home. It appeared to have attached undue significance to the dictum of Lord Bridge in Rosset, in particular as to what conduct was to be taken into account in quantifying an acknowledged beneficial interest. The law had moved on since then, Rosset disapproved. The parties' whole course of conduct in relation to a property had to be taken into account in determining their shared intentions as to its ownership, _[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432, [2007] 4 WLUK 407](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I20AB2C10F4AD11DB93178FA5B02D29F5/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fd0519e4e0a5402789d05c866ce1106a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. If a parent gave financial assistance to a newly-married couple to acquire a home, the usual inference was that it was intended as a gift to both of them, _[McHardy & Sons v Warren [1994] 2 F.L.R. 338, [1994] 3 WLUK 316](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I76940530E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fd0519e4e0a5402789d05c866ce1106a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Midland Bank Plc v Cooke [1995] 4 All E.R. 562, [1995] 7 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I779CE9B0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fd0519e4e0a5402789d05c866ce1106a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. In the instant case, that inference was supported by H and W's behaviour throughout the marriage. The fact that they arranged their finances entirely jointly and undertook joint liability for the repayment of the mortgage was significant, _[Hyett v Stanley [2003] EWCA Civ 942, [2004] 1 F.L.R. 394, [2003] 6 WLUK 530](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC5A7D8E0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fd0519e4e0a5402789d05c866ce1106a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The Court of Appeal appeared not to have attached any weight to that factor.

(2) The shares belonged to H exclusively. W had made a concession to that effect before the Court of Appeal, and that concession was properly made.

(3) The judge at first instance had been correct to find that H and W owned the furniture in the matrimonial home in equal shares. However, he had made an adjustment based on W's estimate of the costs of purchasing the furniture in 1991. That was unrealistic, as in the intervening years much of the furniture would be of little value. Some had been disposed of, and W had declined to take any of it with her when she left the matrimonial home.

(4) There should be an order that the house be sold and the proceeds divided equally, subject to an adjustment in favour of W for 20 per cent of the costs of acquiring the furniture.
