# Jennings v Rice [2002] EWCA Civ 159

FACTS: The claimant, who was married and in full-time employment, visited Mrs Royle (‘R’) almost every evening and weekend over a 10-year period. R was in her eighties and largely incapacitated. The claimant ran errands for R, looked after her house and its garden, and helped her to dress and to go to the toilet. After a burglary, the claimant slept at R’s house every night for three years. The claimant did not receive any payment from R. But she frequently told him: ‘this will all be yours one day,’ referring to the house and its furniture. R died intestate.

The claimant successfully brought a proprietary estoppel claim against R’s estate. The value of R’s estate was £1.3m. The value of the house and its furniture was £435,000. The trial judge satisfied the claimant’s equity by ordering R’s executors to pay him a sum of £200,000.

HELD: The remedy awarded by the trial judge was entirely appropriate. And the judge had rightly rejected the claimant’s argument that he was entitled to the whole of R’s estate or, alternatively, to the house and its furniture.

## Summary

The assessment of an equity arising from a proprietary estoppel would depend on all the circumstances of the case, the most essential requirement being that there should be proportionality between the expectation and the detriment.

## Abstract

The intestate died in 1997. She had been dependent for some years before her death on the services of J who had begun working for her as a gardener and handyman in 1970, but over the years had taken increasing care for her. From the late 1980s onwards, however, she had ceased paying J, telling him instead that he would have the house and furniture on her death, which were then worth GBP 435,000 and her total estate was valued at GBP 1.3 million. J appealed against a decision ([2001] W.T.L.R. 871, [2001] C.L.Y. 5158) that his equity would be satisfied with an award of GBP 200,000, taking into account a series of factors, including the payments J had foregone. J contended that he had expected at least the value of the house and furniture. R, the administrator of the estate, submitted that J's expectation represented the maximum award but the award had to be proportionate to detriment experienced and expectation.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that proportionality was essential between expectation and detriment in deciding how to satisfy an equity based on proprietary estoppel. The detriment to J was more difficult to establish than his expectation. Courts must consider unconscionability. By considering the circumstances and focusing on the payment J had foregone, the judge below had taken all relevant factors into account, _[Campbell v Griffin [2001] EWCA Civ 990, [2001] W.T.L.R. 981, [2001] 6 WLUK 562](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I813FCAF1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8816ac9d34b449608917fc6583f767a3&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Crabb v Arun DC [1976] Ch. 179, [1975] 7 WLUK 122](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8F90CD20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8816ac9d34b449608917fc6583f767a3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch. 210, [2000] 3 WLUK 214](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAEF3ED50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8816ac9d34b449608917fc6583f767a3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
