# Customs and Excise Commissioners v Richmond Theatre Management Ltd [1995] STC 257

FACTS: A theatre company sold advance tickets for performances. The terms and conditions stated that the company would hold the purchase money ‘upon trust’ for the purchaser until the performance took place and would return the money if it was cancelled. There were no restrictions on how the company could use that money and it was not required to account to the customers.

HELD: The company was not a trustee. Its ability to freely use the money for its own purposes was incompatible with a trust.

## Abstract

RTM sold tickets in advance of theatre performances. Standard condition 12 purported to impress the money received from the customer with a trust in favour of the customer so that RTM did not become beneficial owner of the money until the performance had taken place. The money was paid into a deposit account. RTM appealed to the VAT tribunal who held that output tax was not due until the performance had taken place. CEC appealed, arguing that clause 12 was ineffective to give the customer any equitable interest in the money and even if a valid and effective equitable interest was created output tax would still be due at the time of payment.

Held, allowing the appeal, that (1) by allowing RTM to use the money for its own purposes the customer accepted the risk of RTM's insolvency and it would be inequitable to give the customer the rights to trace or place him in a better position than an unsecured creditor, Space Investments Ltd v Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Trust Co (Bahamas) Ltd [1986] 1 W.L.R. 1073, [1986] C.L.Y. 285 followed. The clause did not give the customer any proprietary interest in the ticket money. The money was paid and received as consideration for the theatre performance. Thus, pursuant to the [Value Added Tax Act 1983 s.5(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I46186E51E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=01c07a6434f345bf9aab522220216e05&contextData=(sc.Default)) output tax was due at the time of payment and (2) even if that conclusion was wrong, the fact that the customer had an equitable interest in the money was not inimical to the proposition that, pursuant to the 1983 Act s.5(1), an advance payment had been made in respect of supply which gave rise to a liability to output tax at the time of payment (_[Customs and Excise Commissioners v Faith Construction Ltd [1990] 1 Q.B. 905, [1989] 5 WLUK 313](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I934B1601E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=01c07a6434f345bf9aab522220216e05&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
