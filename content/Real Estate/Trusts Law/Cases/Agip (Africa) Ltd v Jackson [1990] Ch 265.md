# Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson [1990] Ch 265

Liability to account for funds as a constructive trustee is established where the defendant is an accountant who acts dishonestly in knowingly assisting in a fraud by his client. The chief accountant of A, Z, fraudulently altered a payment order for over USD 500,000 causing payment to be made to B, a company owned by J and G. B's account was thus credited by Lloyd's Bank before the bank were reimbursed by the correspondent bank in New York. J, B and G carried on a partnership of accountants in the Isle of Man. They refused to refund the money when asked to do so and, acting throughout on the instructions of their client, transferred the funds in B's account to their client account on the same day. They then transferred various sums overseas. A claimed they were constructive trustees of the funds.

Held, that since the chief accountant of A had acted fraudulently, the funds could be traced in equity and J, B and G were liable to account for funds retained by them. They were liable for the balance since they had knowingly participated in the misapplication of A's funds. They must have known they were involved in concealing the destination of the money, and were at best indifferent to the possibility of fraud. They had failed in their duty to act honestly and had knowingly assisted in the furtherance of a fraudulent and dishonest breach of trust, _[Banque Belge pour l'Etranger v Hambrouck [1921] 1 K.B. 321, [1920] 11 WLUK 26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6F0A89B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=77485715f8a547808522461790931111&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, _[Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd [1981] Ch. 105, [1979] 7 WLUK 137](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I863971A0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=77485715f8a547808522461790931111&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Belmont Finance Corp Ltd v Williams Furniture Ltd [1979] Ch. 250, [1977] 2 WLUK 147](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I736D95B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=77485715f8a547808522461790931111&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _Baden v Societe Generale du Commerce SA [1983] B.C.L.C. 325, [1983] 1 WLUK 9_ , _[Montagu's Settlement Trusts, Re [1987] Ch. 264, [1985] 3 WLUK 292](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I049B91E0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=77485715f8a547808522461790931111&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Ministry of Health v Simpson [1948] Ch. 465, [1948] 7 WLUK 33](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFB6AD130E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=77485715f8a547808522461790931111&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Barclays Bank Ltd v WJ Simms Son & Cooke (Southern) Ltd [1980] Q.B. 677, [1979] 4 WLUK 144](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6F3DCEB0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=77485715f8a547808522461790931111&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
