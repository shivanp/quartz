# Jones v Lock (1865) LR1 CH App 25

**FACTS:** A father returned from a business trip without a gift for his baby. He produced a cheque for £900 payable to himself and putting it into his son’s hands said: _“I give this to baby; it is for himself”._ He put the cheque in a safe saying it was put away for his son. He died shortly afterwards. As he had not endorsed the cheque, legal title to it had not transferred to the son.

**HELD:** The court rejected the argument that he had declared himself a trustee of the cheque. It was clear that he had intended an absolute gift which entails giving away all benefit to, control of and obligation for the property. He had not intended to retain control of the property and therefore assume the onerous obligations of a trustee.

The £900 could not be transferred to the baby and passed to his estate under the will.

A father put a cheque into the hand of his son of nine months old, saying, ‘I give this to baby for himself,’ and then took back the cheque and put it away. He also expressed his intention of giving the amount of the cheque to the son. Shortly afterwards the father died, and the cheque was found amongst his effects. The court held that under the circumstances there had been no gift to or valid declaration of trust for the son. (i) A parol declaration of trust in favour of a volunteer may be valid, and may be enforced in equity. (ii) When there has been a declaration of trust, then it will be enforced, whether there has been consideration or not (Lord Cranworth C).
