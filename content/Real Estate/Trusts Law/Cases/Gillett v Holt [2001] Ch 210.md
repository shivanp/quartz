# Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch 210

## Summary

G, a farm manager, appealed against the dismissal of his claim for equitable relief following promises of inheritance made to him by H, a wealthy landowner who had acted as his employer and benefactor for over 40 years. The court held that on the facts of the case, the repeated assurances made by H were capable of constituting an enforceable claim for proprietary estoppel, and that G had acted to his detriment in reliance on those assurances.

## Abstract

G, who was then aged 12, met H, a wealthy landowner, in 1952 and a close friendship developed between the two. At the age of 15, G left school and began to work for H on a full time basis. Although it was initially intended that G should attend agricultural college, this idea was later abandoned as H persuaded G that he could learn more if he continued to work for him. G met S whom he subsequently married. Prior to the marriage, G and S were taken out for a meal by H during which H stated that G would eventually take over the running of the farm and that on his death, the entire business would be left to G. At the christening of G's first child, H stated that the child's birth would enable the farm to continue through to the next generation. Further assurances were made over subsequent years. In 1992, H met W. A relationship developed between them, and by 1994 W had taken the place of G as the principal beneficiary of H's will. H initiated a police investigation into G's management of the accounts relating to the farm business and other associated businesses which G was by then involved with. As a result of the investigation, G and S were the subject of disciplinary proceedings and thereafter summarily dismissed. G issued proceedings against H and W seeking equitable relief on the basis of proprietary estoppel. The judge held ([1998] 3 All E.R. 917) that whilst G's evidence in relation to the assurances made by H was true, there had nevertheless been no assurance from H capable of amounting to an irrevocable promise that G would inherit his estate despite subsequent changes in circumstances, and the claim therefore failed. The court also held that there was insufficient evidence of detriment. G appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the fact that a testamentary disposition was always capable of revocation could not defeat a promise of the kind made by H, whereby he had effectively assured G that "all this will be yours", _[Taylor v Dickens [1998] 1 F.L.R. 806, [1997] 11 WLUK 213](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA45239B0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c0c327d8b5f34b4cbb26eb13453091e4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. On the facts, it was intended that G should rely on the assurances given and they were clearly relied on. Reliance would in any event be presumed, _[Greasley v Cooke [1980] 1 W.L.R. 1306, [1980] 6 WLUK 187](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB3C65CF1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c0c327d8b5f34b4cbb26eb13453091e4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ referred to. The judge had misdirected himself with regard to the necessary elements of proprietary estoppel. In particular he had exaggerated the extent to which a promise had to be expressly irrevocable in order to give rise to an estoppel, and had further erred in suggesting that there had been a need to find a definite agreement as per the doctrine of mutual wills, and

(2) G's case on detriment was compelling. He had left school in the face of opposition from his headmaster and concern from his parents to work for a much older man who had influenced both his social and his working life. In effect, for a period exceeding 30 years, G and his family had acted as a surrogate family to H. In many ways G had been denied the opportunity of bettering himself in reliance on H's oft repeated assurances, and in those circumstances detriment had clearly been established.
