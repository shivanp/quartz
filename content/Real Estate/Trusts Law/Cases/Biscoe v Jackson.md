# Biscoe v Jackson

In Biscoe v Jackson the intended purpose was the provision of a soup kitchen and cottage hospital for the parish of Shoreditch.

Suitable land could not be found and so the purpose failed. However, the court found that there was a general charitable intention to benefit the sick and poor of the parish.

The impossibility only related to the form of the gift, and the general charitable purpose could be executed cy-pr√®s.
