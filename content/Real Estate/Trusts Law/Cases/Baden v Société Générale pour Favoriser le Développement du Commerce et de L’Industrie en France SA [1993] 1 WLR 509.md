# Baden v Société Générale pour Favoriser le Développement du Commerce et de L’Industrie en France SA [1993] 1 WLR 509

The relevant knowledge to make a bank, stranger to a trust, liable as constructive trustee is actual knowledge of dishonest design or imputed knowledge that would have been obtained by a reasonable banker in that position. A large financial complex, IOS, managed offshore mutual funds known as dollar funds. In 1970 V obtained control of IOS and implemented a dishonest scheme for misappropriating the moneys of the dollar funds. One of V's associates was put in charge of a new Bahamian bank, BCB. One of the parties with whom deposits were made in trust accounts was SG, the defendant in this action. After a complex series of transactions involving the transfer of moneys worldwide, SG received instructions relating to deposits it held in the sum of USD4m. SG, faced with difficulties in complying with those instructions, then received further instructions to transfer the USD4m. to a Panamanian bank. After making enquiries, SG complied with their instructions and transferred the money. Many of the companies, including BCB, went into liquidation and proceedings were commenced to try and recover the dispersed funds. A writ was issued against SG claiming that by transferring the USD4m. they became a constructive trustee of the moneys and liable to account for them.

Held, that

(1) though a stranger to a trust could become accountable as a constructive trustee, SG was not liable because it did not have knowledge at the time of the fraudulent design it was assisting;

(2) the relevant knowledge to found liability was knowledge of the facts, not mere allegations; actual knowledge or knowledge that SG would have obtained but for wilful refusal to make enquiries, or by recklessly refraining from making those enquiries which a reasonable banker would have made, would suffice;

(3) a bank had a primary obligation to comply with instructions save in exceptional circumstances where it came under a duty to make enquiries.
