# Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav 115

FACTS: Under a testamentary trust, shares were held for Vautier until he reached the age of 25, with a requirement to accumulate the income from the trust (i.e. the dividends) until then. There was no gift-over. When he reached the age of majority (21 at the time), Vautier claimed a right to have the trust property transferred to him on the basis that he had a vested, indefeasible interest in it.

HELD: Vautier’s interest was vested. The intention was not to make his interest conditional upon surviving until age 25 but merely to delay enjoyment of the property until such time. The absence of a gift-over indicated that the testator had not intended the property to pass to anyone else. If Vautier wished to receive it early, that was his right.

Testator, by his will, bequeathed to his executors and trustees all the East India stock which should be standing in his name at his death, upon trust to accumulate the dividends until D should attain twenty-five, and then to transfer the principal, together with such accumulations, to D, his executors, administrators, or assigns, absolutely. The will contained also a residuary bequest. Testator had £2,000 East India stock standing in his name at his death: Held D took an immediate vested interest in that legacy, although he was a minor at testator’s death.  

  

There is not only the gift of the intermediate interest, indicative … of an intention to make an immediate gift, because, for the purpose of the interest, there must be an immediate separation of the legacy from the bulk of the estate; but a positive direction to separate the legacy from the estate, and to hold it upon trust for the legatee when he shall attain twenty-five (Lord Cottenham C).
