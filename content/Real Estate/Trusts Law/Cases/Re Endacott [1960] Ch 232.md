# Re Endacott [1960] Ch 232

In Endacott, Lord Evershed reviewed the case law and summarised the approach that should be taken to the recognition of non-charitable purpose trusts.

FACTS: A testator gave his residuary estate “for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself”.

HELD: the provision was held to be void. The purpose was too uncertain to be charitable and did not fall within a recognised class of non-charitable purpose trusts.

In reaching this conclusion Lord Evershed said  
“No principle perhaps has greater sanction of authority behind it than the general proposition that a trust by English law, not being a charitable trust, in order to be effective, must have ascertained or ascertainable beneficiaries.”

In relation to the exceptions he said that

> "…the scope of these cases…ought not to be extended. So to do would be to validate almost limitless heads of non-charitable trusts…; and, in my judgment, that result would be out of harmony with the principles of our law.“

A gift in a will to a parish council "for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself" is not a good charitable gift. A testator gave his residuary estate, worth about GBP 20,000, to a parish council "for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself."

Held, the gift failed and the residue fell to be distributed as on an intestacy; it was not an absolute gift, but something in the nature of a trust was imposed; the authority of the [Local Government Act 1933 s.268](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I46A8BA00A95311E48DE9B9D14A5D9FE7/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1f5d75a9d0444df886879e12fddc7219&contextData=(sc.Default)) for the council to accept gifts for "any local public purpose" was not confined to charitable purposes; nor were the extra powers conferred by of the [Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937 s.4(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I4576C201E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1f5d75a9d0444df886879e12fddc7219&contextData=(sc.Default)) of providing land and buildings for athletic, social or educational objects rendered retrospectively charitable by the [Recreational Charities Act 1958](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6093ACD0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1f5d75a9d0444df886879e12fddc7219&contextData=(sc.Default)); the gift was not the same as a gift for the benefit of the inhabitants of the parish as the memorial might be useful to other persons; nor was it one of the anomalous class of public “object” trusts without ascertainable beneficiaries which may yet be valid if no question of perpetuity arises. Semble, such trusts cannot be treated as valid powers.
