# Modelboard Ltd v Outer Box Ltd (in liquidation) [1993] BCLC 623

FACTS: The plaintiff sold cardboard sheets to the defendant. The parties agreed that:  
(i) the plaintiff would retain ownership of sheets delivered to the defendant until they were paid for.  
(ii) the defendant would pay the purchase price within 30 days of delivery.  
(iii) the defendant could use sheets which had not been paid for in its manufacturing process.  
(iv) if the defendant sold any products incorporating sheets which had not been paid for, the defendant would hold ‘the entire proceeds thereof … in trust for the plaintiff.’  
The defendant used sheets which it had not paid for in its manufacturing process and sold the resultant products to third parties. The issue was whether the defendant held the proceeds of the sale on trust for the plaintiff.

HELD: There was no trust, but the plaintiff had a charge over those proceeds. Michael Hart QC held that the issue must be resolved by ascertaining the correct relationship between the plaintiff’s interest in the sale proceeds and the defendant’s obligation to pay the purchase price.

He used the example of the plaintiff selling sheets to the defendant for £1,000, with the defendant selling products incorporating the sheets for £1,200 before paying the defendant. He rejected the view that the defendant’s obligation was discharged on receipt of the £1,200, with the defendant holding the money on trust for the plaintiff. This would be ‘odd in business terms, since it would allow the plaintiff to enjoy the defendant’s business profits in respect of sales by the latter during the credit period.’

The only solution which made ‘business sense’ and was consistent with ‘commercial reality’ was that the plaintiff’s interest in the £1,200 extended only so far as was necessary to discharge the defendant’s payment obligation.

The plaintiff’s interest in the sale proceeds was capable of being defeated by payment of the purchase price. The plaintiff was therefore a secured creditor, not a beneficiary of a trust. This conclusion was not precluded by the fact that the parties had described the relationship as a trust. The fact that a transaction is characterised by the transacting parties as a trust is not conclusive as to its nature.
