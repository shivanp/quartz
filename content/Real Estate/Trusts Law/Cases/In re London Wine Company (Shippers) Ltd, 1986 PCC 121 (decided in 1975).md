# In re London Wine Company (Shippers) Ltd, 1986 PCC 121 (decided in 1975)

FACTS: The company carried on business as a wine merchant. Customers purchased wine on the basis that the company would continue to store the wine in its warehouse until the customer requested delivery. The company issued ‘certificates of title’ to customers, stating that the customer was ‘the sole and beneficial owner’ of the wine they had purchased. But the company did not appropriate wine from its general stock to any particular contract: it simply maintained the general stock. The issue was whether the company held any wine on trust for the customers.  

HELD: The company did not hold any wine on trust for the customers. Given the company’s failure to allocate specific wine to any particular contract, it was not possible to identify any trust property. Oliver J provided the following reasoning for the decision:  

> 'to create a trust it must be possible to ascertain with certainty not only what the interest of the beneficiary is to be but to what property it is to attach……I cannot see how, for instance, a farmer who declares himself to be a trustee of two sheep (without identifying them) can be said to have created a perfect and complete trust … And it would seem to me to be immaterial that at the time he has a flock of sheep out of which he could satisfy the interest.’
