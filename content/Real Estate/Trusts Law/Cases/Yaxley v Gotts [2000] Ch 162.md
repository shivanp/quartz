# Yaxley v Gotts [2000] Ch 162

Y alleged an oral agreement with G that Y would renovate a property for G to purchase and act as managing agent in return for Y's ownership of the ground floor. However, unknown to Y, G arranged for his son to buy the property. Y performed the renovation and acted as managing agent, but there was a subsequent dispute between Y and G, in which G denied any agreement to transfer the ground floor to Y. Y succeeded below in establishing an equitable interest and G and his son were ordered to provide Y with a 99-year lease or the equivalent sum within four months. G appealed, contending that the oral contract was void for failure to comply with the formalities of the [Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA99A6900E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=787d006044cf42f8889fbccff4842556&contextData=(sc.Default)) and the remedy of proprietary estoppel was therefore inappropriate.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that although the existence of a constructive trust had not been confirmed by the judge below, he had found an undisputed proprietary estoppel, which was a similar remedy and which provided sufficient basis for the existence of a constructive trust. It was clear that s.2(5)(c) expressly provided that the existence or operation of a constructive trust would not be affected by the application of that section.
