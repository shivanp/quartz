# Re Freeland [1952] Ch 110

**FACTS:** The Claimant, Mrs Jackson claimed that Mrs Freeland had given her a Hillman motor car. As the car was not in running order, Mrs Freeland agreed to give it Mrs Jackson when it was back on the road. Several months later, Mrs Freeland wrote to her saying that she had lent the car to another friend (Mrs Rodgers) for a few months but that she was not going back on her word to let Mrs Jackson have it. Mrs Freeland died having appointed Mrs Rodgers and Mrs Jackson as her executors.

**HELD:** Lord Evershed MR said there must be _“an intention of giving, as distinct from an intention to give…”_

The fact that the car had been lent indicated a future intention to give, after it had been put in running order and recovered from Mrs Rodgers. There was no intention to make an immediate gift to Mrs Jackson. It follows that the gift must also relate to existing, not future (or after acquired) property.

The plaintiff alleged that the testatrix gave her a car and that she agreed to lend it to the defendant. The testatrix appointed the defendant and the plaintiff to be her executrices. The testatrix died, and her will was probated. The defendant refused to part with the car. The plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the car. The judge held that the imperfect gift made in the plaintiff’s favour was perfected by her appointment as executrix. The Court of Appeal held that the principle that an imperfect gift might be perfected by the subsequent appointment of the donee to be the donor’s executor only applied where the donor had an immediate intention to make an out-and-out gift. The principle had no application to the case where the donor had a mere intention to make a gift in the future. In the instant case, the plaintiff failed to prove her case. The evidence was incompatible with an immediate intention on the part of the testatrix to make a gift.
