# Re Fry [1946] Ch 312

A donor owned certain shares in a company. He executed transfers, expressed to be by way of gift, to his son and to a private company registered in England and sent the transfers to England to be registered. The company refused to register the transfers unless the consent of the Treasury had been obtained due to the restrictions on the transfer of securities under reg 3A of the Defence (Finance) Regulations 1939. The donor signed the forms needed to obtain the consent, but he died before the consent was obtained. The Chancery Division held that the intended gift had been incomplete, and therefore inoperative. The donor’s executors should not to execute confirmatory transfers. The shares had belonged to the donor’s residuary estate.
