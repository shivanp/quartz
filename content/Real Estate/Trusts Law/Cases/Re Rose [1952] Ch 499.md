# Re Rose [1952] Ch 499

FACTS: Two transfers of shares were executed by Mr Rose on 30 March 1943: One by gift to his wife and the other to trustees to be held on trust for his wife and son.

The transfers needed to have been effected before 10 April 1943 if estate duty was to be avoided on Mr Rose’s death in 1947. The transfers and share certificates were delivered to the company registrar but were not registered until 30 June 1943. Legal title to the shares did not therefore pass until 30 June 1943 and so after the key date of 10 April 1943

ISSUE: Could equity intervene and hold that the equitable title had passed to the transferees prior to 10 April 1943 to avoid the payment of estate duty?

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that no estate duty was payable. The transfers were effective in equity when Mr Rose had delivered the correct transfer documentation to the Company registrar on 30 March 1943, before the crucial date of 10 April 1943.

This case established that Mr Rose held the legal title on **constructive trust** for the recipients (pending registration of legal title). At this point, the intended transferees had the equitable interest. They were found to hold the equitable interest because:

1. The **correct method of transfer** had been used
2. The transferor had done **everything within his own power** to effect the transfer (when he sent the documentation to the Company registrar)
3. The documentation ended up **in the hands of the person capable of effecting the legal transfer** (in this case, the company’s Registrar)

If a man purporting to transfer property executes documents which are not apt to effect that purpose, the court cannot then extract from those documents some quite different transaction and say that they were intended merely to operate as a declaration of trust, which ex facie they are not. If, however, a document is apt and proper to transfer the property – is, in truth, the appropriate way in which the property must be transferred – it does not follow from the earlier statement that, as a result, either during some limited period or otherwise, there may not arise, for the purpose of giving effect to the transfer, some trust. Thus, as the phrase “transfer the shares” must be taken to mean a transfer of all rights and interests in them there can be nothing contrary to the law in a man saying that so long as, pending registration, the legal estate remains in the donor, he is, by the necessary effect of his own deed, a trustee of that legal estate.

The deceased executed a transfer of shares to his wife in an unlimited company on March 30, 1943, and the transferee agreed to take the shares; the transfer was in consideration of the transferor's love and affection for the transferee. The transfer was not registered by the company until June 30, 1943. According to the articles of the company, the directors had unlimited authority to reject transfers of shares. The transferor died on February 15, 1947, and the question was whether the gift escaped estate duty or whether duty was payable by virtue of the [Finance Act, 1894 s.2(1)(c)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBA8B68607FA411E48FD487885805EEF3/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=329090e5f67d493394523a1a51de2822&contextData=(sc.Default)) and amending Acts. The relevant date before which the disposition had to be made was April 10, 1943.

Held, in so far as under the regulations of the company there was a gap of time between the execution of a transfer and the vesting of the legal estate in the transferee, the deceased was during that time a trustee of all his interest in the shares transferred; therefore, the transferee was the beneficial owner of the shares before the relevant date, and no estate duty was payable, although the transfer was registered after that date; _[Rose, Re [1949] Ch. 78, [1948] 11 WLUK 14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8F9F0880E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=329090e5f67d493394523a1a51de2822&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Milroy v Lord 45 E.R. 1185, [1862] 7 WLUK 110](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICAC08CE0E57211DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=329090e5f67d493394523a1a51de2822&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.
