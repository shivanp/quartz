# Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17

What were the unusual facts in Stack that prompted the House of Lords to award Ms Dowden a 65% share and Mr Stack a 35% share in a home that they owned as legal joint tenants?

The couple were in a relationship for 27 years and raised four children together. Whilst they purchased their shared home in joint names and both contributed (albeit unequally) to the deposit and mortgage, they otherwise kept their finances rigidly separate.

Throughout their relationship they kept separate bank accounts and made separate savings and investment transactions. They maintained financial independence throughout their relationship.

This was held to be indicative that they did not intend a beneficial joint tenancy or to have equal shares in the house.

## Summary

Where a property was conveyed into the joint names of a cohabiting couple without any explicit declaration of their respective beneficial interests, the starting point where the property had to be divided upon the breakdown of the relationship was that where there was joint legal ownership, there was also joint beneficial ownership. The onus was upon the person seeking to show that the parties intended their beneficial interests to be different from their legal interests and in what way.

## Abstract

The appellant (S) appealed against an order ( _[[2005] EWCA Civ 857, (2006) 1 F.L.R. 254](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB85C1C41E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50a7feb2ad714fd7a453afd22f614499&contextData=(sc.Search))_ ) specifying the division of the net proceeds of sale of the home he had shared with his former partner (D) and their children.

D and S had purchased the house in their joint names using the then current land registry form, which contained no declaration of trust but contained a declaration that the survivor could give a good receipt for capital money arising from a disposition of the property. The purchase was funded by the sale of their previous property, which had been in D's sole name, plus savings in D's name, and a mortgage held in both names. S paid the mortgage interest and endowment policy premiums, while together they paid off the capital, with D contributing a greater proportion. When they bought the house, D and S had been cohabiting for 18 years and had four children. Nearly all aspects of their respective finances had been kept separate. Nine years after purchasing the house, their relationship broke down and they agreed a court order that excluded S from the house and required D to pay S for the cost of his alternative accommodation. S then successfully sought a declaration that the house was held upon trust by the couple as tenants in common in equal shares and an order for its sale. D appealed and the Court of Appeal ordered that the net proceeds be divided 65 per cent to her and 35 per cent to S on the basis that the declaration as to the receipt for capital money in the transfer document could not be taken as an express declaration of trust, nor could it infer an intention that the beneficial ownership be equal, because there was no evidence that either of them had understood the declaration to carry such significance. The issues were whether a conveyance into joint names established a prima facie case of joint and equal beneficial interests and whether the Court of Appeal had been correct to overrule the judge's order that D compensate S for the cost of his accommodation.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(Lord Neuberger dissenting on the issue of accommodation payments)

(1) The starting point where there was joint legal ownership was joint beneficial ownership. The onus was upon the person seeking to show that the parties intended their beneficial interests to be different from their legal interests and in what way. Context was everything, and each case would turn on its own facts. Many more factors than financial contributions could be relevant to intention, and the court gave a non-exhaustive list. Cases in which the joint legal owners were to be taken to have intended that their beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests would be very unusual. Accordingly, it was for D to show that the common intention when they bought the house was that she and S should hold the property otherwise than as joint beneficial tenants, and there were, on the evidence, many factors for her to rely on. The fact that she and S had lived together for such a long time and had children together, yet had kept their affairs rigidly separate, was strongly indicative that they did not intend their shares, even in the property that was put into their joint names, to be equal, and she had made good her case for a higher share, _[Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] A.C. 777, [1969] 4 WLUK 46](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1E6A7910E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50a7feb2ad714fd7a453afd22f614499&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered, _[Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546, [2005] Fam. 211, [2004] 5 WLUK 99](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I15C110D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50a7feb2ad714fd7a453afd22f614499&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied and _[Walker v Hall [1984] Fam.

(2) In determining the issue of payments from D to S for his alternative accommodation, the criteria laid down in the [Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I226080B0E44F11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50a7feb2ad714fd7a453afd22f614499&contextData=(sc.Search)) were to be applied in preference to cases pre-dating that regime. The judge at first instance had erred in failing to apply those criteria and the Court of Appeal had been correct to quash his order in this respect.

(3) (Per Lord Neuberger) Although the judge's reason for ordering D to pay S's accommodation costs had been weak, partly because he had not been referred to the 1996 Act, a proper exercise of the court's power under [s.14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I226821D0E44F11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=50a7feb2ad714fd7a453afd22f614499&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the Act would, in the circumstances, have been to order the compensation at the level the parties had originally agreed.
