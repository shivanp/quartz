A joint and several covenant was entered into by a principal debtor and his surety that the principal would pay a sum of money by three instalments, with interest, on three specified days. The first instalment was duly paid, but before the second instalment became payable the surety became bankrupt. The creditor was allowed by the commissioner to be admitted to claim against bankrupt's estate in respect of the amount of the two unpaid instalments and interest: Held the claim was properly admitted as upon a contingent liability under 1849 Act, s 178 (repealed)
