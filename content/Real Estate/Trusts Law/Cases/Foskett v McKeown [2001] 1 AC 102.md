# Foskett v McKeown [2001] 1 AC 102

## Summary

M used GBP 20,440 that he had fraudulently obtained from F and other purchasers of Portuguese land to pay 40 per cent of the insurance premiums on his life and subsequently committed suicide. F appealed against a decision that the purchasers were entitled only to the refund of the premiums together with interest and not to a proportionate share of the policy's proceeds of approximately GBP 1 million. The beneficiaries, M's children, cross appealed claiming that the disputed premium payments had not affected the insurance policy. The court held that the purchasers had a proprietary right to receive a proportion of the policy fund.

## Abstract

M controlled a company that obtained money from a number of prospective purchasers to acquire and develop land in the Algarve in Portugal. Although the land was purchased, the development did not take place and the funds were found to have been dissipated. In the meantime M had insured his life for GBP 1 million and subsequently committed suicide. F and 219 other investors in the Portuguese land development discovered that M had used GBP 20,440 of their investment monies to pay 40 per cent of the insurance premiums on his life policy and claimed a proportionate share of the policy's proceeds. F appealed against a decision that the purchasers were entitled only to the refund of the premiums together with interest. The beneficiaries, M's children, cross appealed claiming that (1) the insurance policy would have paid out the whole sum as a result of the first two premiums that M had paid from his own resources and therefore the disputed premium payments had not affected the insurance policy, and (2) the purchasers had already been recompensed by obtaining the land, shares in the company, and a settlement of GBP 600,000 from the bank from which the moneys had been dissipated.

Held, allowing the appeal (Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of Craighead dissenting) and dismissing the cross appeal, that the purchasers had a proprietary right to receive 40 per cent of the policy fund. The equitable interests of the purchasers were directly traceable into the policy moneys and the court had no discretion in the matter. There was no question of resulting or constructive trusts, nor fairness and reasonableness, just the straightforward enforcement of property rights. With regard to the cross appeal, what the purchasers had received was a remedy from different proceedings and they had been put to no election in relation to it. This was not an action for damages where the loss could be mitigated by recovery elsewhere and no adjustment was therefore necessary.
