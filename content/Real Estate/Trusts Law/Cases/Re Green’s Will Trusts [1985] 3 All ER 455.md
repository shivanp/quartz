# Re Greenâ€™s Will Trusts [1985] 3 All ER 455

A gift for the prevention of cruelty to animals is prima facie charitable and will be valid if it vests within a period permitted by the rule against perpetuities, which may be any proper period unambiguously identified in the instrument creating the gift. Notwithstanding certification by the Air Ministry that her son was missing in action, presumed dead, during the second World War, the testatrix directed that the residue of her will be invested on trust to accumulate capital and income for her son absolutely, provided that if he should fail to claim the estate by January 1, 2020, the trustees of the will should establish a charitable foundation for the benefit of cruelly treated animals. Following the death of the testatrix her trustees sought declarations that her son had predeceased her, and that the proposed gift to the charitable foundation was a valid gift. The next of kin contended that the codicil to the will had not specified "a number of years" but a period, which could only become a number of years by calculation.

Held, that (i) a trust for the relief of cruelty to animals was clearly prima facie charitable; (ii) a period is sufficiently specified for the purposes of the [Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA114E3D0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=bfceab36e5594f2fbb99aeede75a9b1f&contextData=(sc.Default)) if it is made unambiguously clear what that period is to be; (iii) on the true construction of the will the gift vested within the perpetuity period and was therefore valid; (iv) although the court would always try to give effect to the intentions of the testatrix, the court was entitled to take a different view from her as to the probability that the son was still alive, and accordingly was entitled to, and would, presume his death in 1943. The trustees would therefore be permitted to deal with the estate on the footing that the son had predeceased the testatrix.
