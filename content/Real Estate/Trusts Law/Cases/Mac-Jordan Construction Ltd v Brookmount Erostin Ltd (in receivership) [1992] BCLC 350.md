# Mac-Jordan Construction Ltd v Brookmount Erostin Ltd (in receivership) [1992] BCLC 350

## Abstract

M, a builder, appealed against the rejection of his request for an order to make BE, an insolvent property developer, comply with a contractual obligation to establish a retention fund agreed before BE became insolvent.

Held: Appeal dismissed. The bank's floating charge over BE took priority over M's unsecured claim even though the bank already had express notice of the terms of the contract between M and BE, _[De Mattos v Gibson 45 E.R. 108, [1859] 5 WLUK 112](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I40EFBF50E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=054bad203ae04dd69496d6b91704eb3f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Swiss Bank Corp v Lloyds Bank Ltd [1979] Ch. 548, [1978] 5 WLUK 43](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC721B231E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=054bad203ae04dd69496d6b91704eb3f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. M's claim to have an equitable interest in BE's assets was rejected because there were no identifiable assets to which M's contractual rights applied and the banks' floating charge did not hinder M benefiting from that right until the charge crystallised. Once that event had occurred the bank's claim had priority. BE's failure to appropriate and set aside the fund did not give M equitable rights in the bank's floating charge

**FACTS**: In _Mac-Jordan_ the defendant employed the plaintiff to construct a building. They agreed that the defendant would:

- pay the plaintiff as the work progressed.
- retain 3% of each payment.
- establish a separate fund in respect of the retained sums.
- hold the fund on trust for the plaintiff until the work was completed.

The defendant retained 3% from each payment but failed to establish a fund representing those sums. The defendant became insolvent. The issue was whether the defendant was a trustee for the plaintiff, giving the plaintiff proprietary rights over the defendant’s bank account. If not, the plaintiff would merely rank as an unsecured creditor.

**HELD**: The defendant was not a trustee for the plaintiff.

Scott LJ held that the plaintiff was unable to establish a trust because the defendant had not established a separate fund. He said that ‘there were, and are, no identifiable assets impressed with the trusts applicable to the retention fund.’

He rejected an argument that the defendant held the sum credited to its bank account on trust for the plaintiff on the ground that the defendant had never agreed to create a trust of its bank account. It had agreed to create a trust of a separate fund, but the fund itself was never actually established. In short, there was no trust because there was no trust property. The defendant had breached its contractual obligation to create the fund. But this only gave rise to a personal right to sue the defendant for the money.
