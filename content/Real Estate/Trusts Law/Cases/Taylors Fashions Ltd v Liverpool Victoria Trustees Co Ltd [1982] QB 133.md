# Taylors Fashions Ltd v Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd [1982] QB 133

Tenants of two adjoining shops claimed specific performance of options to renew in their leases which the landlord disclaimed for lack of registration under the Land Charges Act 1925. Both tenants had carried out substantial improvements in reliance on the option.

Held, options are registrable, following _[Beesly v Hallwood Estates Ltd [1961] Ch. 105, [1960] 11 WLUK 89](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I73033B20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a5958cbf11f646edb58fdcc37684f218&contextData=(sc.Default))_ . However, the doctrine of acquiescence or equitable estoppel will bind the landlord if it would be "dishonest or unconscionable" for him to argue otherwise: per Buckley L.J. in _[Shaw v Applegate [1977] 1 W.L.R. 970, [1977] 2 WLUK 203](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA74B0FB0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a5958cbf11f646edb58fdcc37684f218&contextData=(sc.Default))_ . In Taylor's case the landlord had arrived on the scene after the work had been done and it was not possible to say that the works would not have been done had the tenant known that the option was void: specific performance refused. In Old's case the landlord had encouraged the tenant to carry out works, to take another lease of adjoining premises and had fixed the value of the freehold with the burden of the option: specific performance granted.

Per curiam, it is not an essential element of this category of estoppel that the party estopped, although he must have known of the other party's belief, must have known that that belief was mistaken.
