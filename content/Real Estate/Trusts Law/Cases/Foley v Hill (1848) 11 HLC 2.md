# Foley v Hill (1848) 11 HLC 2

The House of Lords held that the relation between a banker and a customer, who paid money into the bank, was the ordinary relation of a debtor and a creditor with a superadded obligation arising out of the banker's custom to honour the customer's drafts. That relation was not altered by the banker's agreement to allow the interest on the balances in the bank.
