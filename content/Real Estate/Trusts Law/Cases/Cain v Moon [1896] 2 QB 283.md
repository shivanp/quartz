# Cain v Moon [1896] 2 QB 283

A person, not in contemplation of death, gave a deposit note to her mother to take care of for her. Later, the note having remained all the time in the motherâ€™s possession, the donor, who was then in contemplation of death, gave the note absolutely to the mother in case she should not recover. The donor died a few days afterwards.

The Divisional Court held that for an effective donatio mortis causa, three things had to combine:  
(i) the gift or donation had to be made in contemplation, though not necessarily in expectation of death;  
(ii) there had to be delivery to the donee of the subject-matter of the gift; and  
(iii) the gift had to be made under such circumstances as to show that the thing was to revert to the donor in case he had to recover.

In the instant case, there was a sufficient delivery for the purpose of an effective donatio mortis causa by changing the character in which the mother already held possession of the note.
