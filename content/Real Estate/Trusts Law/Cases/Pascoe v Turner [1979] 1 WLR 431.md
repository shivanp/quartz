# Pascoe v Turner [1979] 1 WLR 431

FACTS: The claimant and the defendant started living together as man and wife in 1964. They lived in the claimant’s house. In 1973, their relationship broke down. The claimant, who was having an affair with another woman, moved out of the house. He told the defendant: ‘The house is yours.’ He repeated this statement many times.

In reliance on this statement, the defendant made various repairs and improvements to the house. She also redecorated and purchased new carpets, curtains and furniture. In total, the defendant spent £700 (of her £1,000 savings) on the house and its furnishings. The claimant never transferred the house to the defendant.

In 1976, the claimant initiated proceedings to recover possession of the house from the defendant. By way of counterclaim, the defendant made a proprietary estoppel claim against the claimant.

HELD: The claimant had made an assurance to the defendant that the house was hers and the defendant acted to her detriment in reliance on that assurance.

Accordingly, the defendant had established an equity by way of proprietary estoppel. The most appropriate way to satisfy the equity was to order the claimant to transfer the house to the defendant. Thus, the defendant was entitled to the house.
