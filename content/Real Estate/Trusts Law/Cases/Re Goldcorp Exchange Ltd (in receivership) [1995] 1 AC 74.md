# Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd (in receivership) [1995] 1 AC 74

## Abstract

K, receiver of gold dealer Goldcorp Exchange (G), appealed from a decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal ([1993] 1 N.Z.L.R. 257) that certain unrepresented non-allocated claimants (UNC) were entitled to gold bullion stored by G as against the chargee, the Bank of New Zealand. UNC had purchased gold "for future delivery" from G, whose brochures promised that purchasers' non-allocated located gold would be stored free and could be claimed on notice.

Held: Appeal allowed. The purchase contract itself did not transfer title to purchasers because the goods were unascertained. Although G's brochures promised that purchasers would have title to gold held in storage, a trust did not arise either when the purchase contract was signed or subsequently when G bought the gold. It was contrary to policy and logic to imply a fiduciary duty where all that existed was breach of contract. Knights v Wiffen (1869-70) L.R. 5 Q.B. 660 , Simm v Anglo-American Telegraph Co (1879-80) L.R. 5 Q.B.D. 188 , Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd [1986] P.C.C. 121 and MacJordan Construction Ltd v Brookmount Erostin Ltd (1992) B.C.L.C. 350 considered. The argument that equity required the court to grant restitution of the purchase moneys was rejected.
