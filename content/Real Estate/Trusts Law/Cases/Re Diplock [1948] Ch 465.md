# Re Diplock [1948] Ch 465

A testator's next of kin challenged the executor's payment of a sum of money to a charity on the ground of a mistake as to the construction of the will. Before that intimation had been received, the charity withdrew a part of that sum from its banking account and placed it on deposit at a savings bank. The charity, after the receipt of the intimation, withdrew the balance and placed it on deposit on the same bank. The Court of Appeal, Civil Division held that the accounts had treated the banking account and the savings bank deposit account as a conglomerate mass and had attributed slices of them to the various special funds. There had been nothing to show that the charity had definitely attributed any particular bank moneys to any particular account. Thus, it had been impossible to treat any item held by the charity as identifiable wholly or in part with the testator's money.
