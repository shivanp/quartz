# Milroy v Lord (1862) 31 LJ Ch 798

FACTS: The settlor intended to transfer shares to Lord to be held on trust for the Claimants. The settlor completed a voluntary deed but did not comply with the correct method for the transfer of legal title in the shares to Lord as trustee.

In order to transfer legal title to the shares and properly constitute the trust, it was necessary to complete the appropriate transfer form and send it to the company registrar who would then register the new owner. Instead, the settlor simply handed the share certificates to Lord (i.e. the intended trustee). The settlor died several years later and there was a dispute as to the ownership of the shares.

HELD: The trust was not constituted, despite the settlorâ€™s intention to create one, as legal title to the shares had not vested in Lord. The settlor had not completed the process of transferring legal title and Equity would not treat him as if he had.

The settlor executed a voluntary deed purporting to assign his shares in a bank to the trustee, to be held by him for the benefit of the plaintiffs. The trustee held a general power of attorney authorising him to transfer the shares, and the settlor gave him a further power of attorney to receive the dividends on his shares in the bank. The Court of Appeal in Chancery held that no valid trust of the shares had been created in the trustee, for although he held a power of attorney under which he might have vested the shares in himself, he had not done so, and had not bound to do so without directions from the settlor, since he held the power only as an agent for the settlor. Therefore, the disposition of the shares had failed as being an imperfect voluntary gift.
