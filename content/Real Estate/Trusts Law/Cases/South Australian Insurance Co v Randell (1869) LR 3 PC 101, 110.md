# South Australian Insurance Co v Randell (1869) LR 3 PC 101, 110

A bailment on trust implies that there is reserved to the bailor the right to claim a redelivery of the property deposited in bailment. Whenever there is a delivery of property on a contract for an equivalent in money, or some other valuable commodity, and not for the return of the identical subject-matter in its original or an altered form, this is a transfer of property for value; it is a sale and not a bailment.  

  

Corn was deposited by farmers with a miller, to be stored and used as part of the current consumable stock or capital of the miller’s trade, and was by him mixed with other corn deposited for the like purpose, subject to the right of the farmers to claim at any time an equal quantity of corn of the like quality, without reference to any specific bulk from which it was to be taken, or in lieu thereof the market price of an equal quantity, on the day on which he made his demand, with a small charge for general purposes: Held such a transaction amounted to a sale by the farmer to the miller, and was not a bailment of the corn.

Whether there is a delivery of property on a contract for an equivalent in money, or some other valuable commodity, and not for the return of the identical subject-matter in its original or an altered form, this is a transfer of property for value, it is a sale and not a bailment, where, therefore, corn was deposited by farmers with a miller, to be stored and used as part of the current consumable stock or capital of the miller’s trade, and was by him mixed with other corn deposited for the like purpose, subject to the right of the farmers to claim at any time an equal quantity of corn of the like quality, without reference to any specific bulk from which it was to be taken, or in lieu thereof the market price of any equal quantity, on the day on which he made his demand, with a small charge for general purposes: Held such a transaction amounted to a sale by the farmer to the miller, and was not a bailment of the corn, and entitled the miller to claim in respect thereof upon a policy of insurance, against fire as for his own property, notwithstanding that such corn was not specifically insured, or described, as required by the conditions of the policy, as ‘goods held in trust and on commission,’ upon which condition the claim was resisted by the insurers.
