# Greasley v Cooke [1980] 1 WLR 1306

FACTS: In 1938, the defendant moved into the house of a widower to work as a maid. The widower had four children, including a son, Kenneth. In 1946, the defendant and Kenneth started to live together as man and wife. The widower died in 1948. The defendant was not paid any wages after his death. She did not seek alternative employment because Kenneth and his brother (who had jointly inherited the house) assured her that she could live in the house for the rest of her life. In reliance on this assurance, the defendant continued to look after the family who lived in the house until Kenneth’s death in 1975. In particular, she cared for Kenneth’s mentally ill sister, which was a ‘hard and unpleasant task’, for very many years. She was not paid for her services.

On Kenneth’s death, the family members who inherited the house commenced proceedings to recover possession from the defendant. The defendant counterclaimed, relying on proprietary estoppel.

HELD: Since the defendant had looked after the family for 27 years for no pay and on the faith of the assurances which Kenneth and his brother had made to her, she had established an equity by way of proprietary estoppel. The equity was satisfied by giving her a licence to occupy the house rent-free for the rest of her life.
