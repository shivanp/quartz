# Re Montaguâ€™s Settlement Trusts [1987] Ch 264

It is unlikely that there could ever be imputed knowledge in relation to imposing a constructive trust. In 1923 the future tenth Duke of Manchester assigned to trustees chattels to which he was absolutely entitled in remainder expectant on the death of his father, the ninth Duke, on trusts that the trustees should make inventories of such chattels as in their absolute discretion they should consider suitable for inclusion in the settlement and to hold the residue in trust for the tenth Duke absolutely. After the death of the ninth Duke, no inventory was made, and the trustees delivered certain of the chattels to the tenth Duke and many were sold. After the death of the tenth Duke the eleventh Duke claimed that the trustees had acted in breach of trust, and that as constructive trustee, so had the tenth Duke with the result that the Dowager Duchess now held the chattels as constructive trustee or as a volunteer.

Held, it was unlikely that knowledge could ever be imputed in relation to imposing a constructive trust. There was no reason why the Duke's solicitor's knowledge of the meaning of the clause allowing release of the chattels should be imputed to the Duke. Even if he had understood the clause, there was no evidence that he remembered it at the time of receiving the chattels. It could not be said that his conscience was affected and that there was a duty on him to make inquiry. Accordingly, although the trustees had transferred the chattels in breach of trust, the Duke had not received them as constructive trustee.
