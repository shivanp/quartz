# Le Foe v Le Foe [2001] 2 FLR 970

A husband and wife, D and M, both had equitable interests in their matrimonial home. Whereas D had originally assumed responsibility for the mortgage repayments while M paid for other domestic expenditure, M subsequently used an inheritance to pay off a large part of the mortgage debt and used the premises for a bed and breakfast business which met most of the mortgage repayments from then on. Subsequently, unbeknown to M, D took out a large mortgage over the house with W, fraudulently representing that he was separated from M and that he had a large annual personal income. D failed to meet the repayments on this mortgage. W sought possession of the matrimonial home and the question arose as to whether M could resist the repossession proceedings.

Held, granting W an order for sale of the matrimonial home, that M's contributions supported the inference that D and M had intended M to have a 50 per cent share in the matrimonial home, _[Lloyds Bank Plc v Rosset [1991] 1 A.C. 107, [1990] 3 WLUK 428](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE21B0510E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2148087939c0452fad7a9072dbf303d8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. M was in actual occupation of the home in terms of the [Land Registration Act 1925 s.70(1)(g)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39ECF620E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2148087939c0452fad7a9072dbf303d8&contextData=(sc.Default)) at the time W's mortgage was completed but she was bound by that part of the remortgage proceeds that had been used to discharge the previous mortgage as she had consented to the repayment. However, the possession order would be stayed pending an order for sale as part of separate ancillary relief proceedings. It was inequitable to disregard the extent of D's fraud, so that on sale the proceeds would be split between D and M, with D's portion bearing the outstanding remortgage debt.
