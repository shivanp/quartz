# Walsh v Singh [2009] EWCA 3219 (Ch)

## Summary

The claimant was unable to prove that she had been promised a beneficial interest in property bought by her then partner, sufficient to establish a constructive trust, express or implied, in her favour. Although she had given up her career to run an equine business from the property, she had done so because she wanted to rather than because she expected a beneficial share in the property.

## Abstract

The claimant (W) sought a declaration that she had a beneficial interest in a residential property owned by the first defendant (S) and, alternatively, a quantum meruit based on unjust enrichment.

W and S had entered into a relationship and were engaged to be married. In the course of their relationship S bought a property for which he paid the entire purchase price. It was the parties' intention to set up an equine centre on the property. S believed that establishing an equine centre would enhance the land's planning prospects. To that end, the parties also purchased surrounding fields and a paddock. W contributed towards the purchase price of those properties by way of loan extended to S. W decided to leave her career in order to pursue the development of the equine business. The business was, at all material times, S's business and the losses it actually made were on his account. After the breakdown of the relationship, W claimed that she had been promised, on at least two occasions, a half share in the equity of the property.

W submitted that

(1) she was entitled to a share in the property as a result of an express bargain trust or, alternatively, an implied bargain constructive trust. She argued that she had rendered S significant assistance: searching for appropriate properties, researching the legal history and planning potential of the actual property and carrying out and supervising renovation works. She contended that she would never have given up her career at the Bar to pursue the equine business unless she had been reassured that half the property would be hers;

(2) alternatively, she was entitled to a quantum meruit based on unjust enrichment, to reflect the value of her contributions to the equine project.

## Held

Judgment for defendants.

(1) There was no doubt that W gave assistance in all the ways she suggested. But she did not do so alone and the significance of her contributions was not as great as she made out. Nevertheless, her contributions were significant and would be sufficient to give rise to a constructive trust or an estoppel if the necessary common intention coupled with detrimental reliance could be established. However, it was not possible to accept, without more, that W had been promised half of the property or that she was encouraged to believe that she would have a share in it at the time of its purchase or subsequently. S said nothing which might reasonably have been taken as promising W a beneficial interest in the property. He saw its purchase as an investment opportunity rather than as an exclusive place to live. The exploitation of that opportunity would need paying for, and he was, as W knew, the only candidate for that purpose. Although she had given up her career at the Bar, her decision was born of a joint volition. It suited S to have her on the premises running the business and it suited W to be there because she preferred to be working with horses than to be at the Bar. Ultimately, she chose to devote herself to the equestrian business in the context of a long-term relationship and intended marriage rather than upon the strength of any belief that she had or would one day acquire a beneficial interest in the property. Much of W's evidence in support of her case rested upon the perception that she had been living with S as man and wife. However, the rights of the parties had to be judged by reference to principles of law which did not readily fit the general perception of what was fair and reasonable between spouses. Accordingly, on the strength of the evidence there was no constructive trust in relation to the property.

(2) W made her contributions to the equine project voluntarily rather than on some expectation that she would be rewarded. Her claim, in any event, would face intractable difficulties when it came to evaluating the extent of any enrichment. Such an evaluation would require the court to enter into a highly undesirable analytical process which it would not be able to undertake satisfactorily in the context of a domestic relationship. Finally, the legal floodgates would be opened if dashed expectations of a long-term domestic relationship opened the door to unjust enrichment claims.
