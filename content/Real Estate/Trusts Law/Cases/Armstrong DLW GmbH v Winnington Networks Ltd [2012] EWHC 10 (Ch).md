# Armstrong DLW GmbH v Winnington Networks Ltd [2012] EWHC 10 (Ch)

In Armstrong, the defendant was offered the opportunity to purchase property. As the defendant had not had previous dealings with the seller, it implemented its ‘know your client’ (KYC) procedure. It emailed the seller and asked it to provide information to prove its ownership of the property. The seller replied to the email but did not include the information, which was ‘inherently suspicious and should have set alarm bells ringing’.

Nevertheless, the defendant made a conscious decision not to follow its KYC procedure: it purchased the property from the seller and sold it on. Inevitably, the seller had stolen the property from the claimant. The claimant brought an action against the defendant for knowing receipt.

Morris QC held that the seller held the property on constructive trust for the claimant (because it had stolen it from the claimant). The sale to the defendant was a breach of that trust. The defendant’s knowledge rendered its receipt unconscionable:

> this was not just a case where the defendant failed to make inquiries that should have been made, but rather was a case where the relevant inquiries were made, but not followed through by awaiting a response to those inquiries. [The defendant] deliberately and consciously chose to take the risk that the [property] did not belong to [the seller] … [The defendant’s] knowledge fell within, at least, Baden type (3), because [the defendant] wilfully and recklessly failed to make such further inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would have made in the circumstances[.]

## Summary

A trader in carbon emission allowances was liable for knowing receipt of trust property or in restitution where it had bought allowances knowing that the vendor might not have title to or authority to sell them but went ahead with the transaction, deliberately closing its eyes to that risk and failing to make the inquiries that an honest and reasonable person would have made.

## Abstract

The claimant company (C) made a claim against the defendant company (W) in restitution or knowing receipt following the fraudulent transfer of certain carbon emission allowances known as EUAs.

C operated two factories in Germany both containing power plants which emitted carbon dioxide. They were installations and C was the operator of them for the purposes of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme established pursuant to [Directive 2003/87](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBF7DBCFFE46047FCA19391A874C1D900/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default)). As the operator, C had been credited with EUAs which were held in an account with the German registry. EUAs were entirely electronic and only existed online in national registries. Trading in EUAs was carried out by transferring them to and from different registry accounts in different Member States. W, which traded in EUAs, was contacted by an individual representing a company (Z) in Dubai offering to sell EUAs. C's user name and password were then obtained by fraud and used to transfer EUAs from C's account with the German registry to W's account with the United Kingdom registry. W sold the EUAs and paid Z for them. C claimed that it had a proprietary restitutionary claim against W in respect of the EUAs, or a personal restitutionary claim to recover their value on the basis of unjust enrichment, or a claim based on W's knowing receipt of the EUAs or their traceable proceeds.

C submitted that W had shut its eyes to the obvious possibility of fraud or at least knew of such circumstances as would indicate to an honest and reasonable man that the transaction was probably improper.

## Held

Judgment for claimant.

(1) An EUA was property at common law, _[National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth [1965] A.C. 1175, [1965] 5 WLUK 32](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0AA43790E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. It was a form of intangible property, _[Celtic Extraction Ltd (In Liquidation), Re [2001] Ch. 475, [1999] 7 WLUK 312](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I83963E11E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied and _[Swift v Dairywise Farms Ltd (No.1) [2000] 1 W.L.R. 1177, [1999] 11 WLUK 511](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC70EED80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered (see paras 50, 58-61 of judgment).

(2) Where legal title remained with the claimant, a proprietary restitutionary claim at common law was available in respect of receipt by the defendant of a chose in action or other intangible property, _[Trustee of the Property of FC Jones & Sons (A Firm) v Jones [1997] Ch. 159, [1996] 4 WLUK 266](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDE8B3220E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Foskett v McKeown [2001] 1 A.C. 102, [2000] 5 WLUK 521](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA89140C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. If there was a proprietary restitutionary claim, then there was no claim for restitution based on unjust enrichment, _[Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd [1991] 2 A.C. 548, [1991] 6 WLUK 47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE12EA941E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and Foskett applied (paras 83, 88-95).

(3) Bona fide purchase for value without notice was a defence to a proprietary restitutionary claim, Lipkin and Foskett applied. The types of knowledge relevant to the bona fide purchaser defence were also relevant for determining whether it was unconscionable for the recipient of trust property to retain it, _[Baden v Societe Generale pour Favoriser le Developpement du Commerce et de l'Industrie en France SA [1993] 1 W.L.R. 509, [1983] 4 WLUK 133](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6D7A4CC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))[Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele [2001] Ch. 437, [2000] 6 WLUK 317](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6EBA46D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Niru Battery Manufacturing Co v Milestone Trading Ltd (No.1) [2003] EWCA Civ 1446, [2004] Q.B. 985, [2003] 10 WLUK 618](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0D51CB60E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered (paras 99-101, 123, 131-132).

(4) When the third party fraudster gained control of the EUAs in C's account he became a constructive trustee of them, so that C's claim lay in knowing receipt, _[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC [1996] A.C. 669, [1996] 5 WLUK 343](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF83E7B00E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e4a2c3f1be3f4011ae1a052c34d35518&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied (paras 275-277).

(5) W's knowledge of the relevant circumstances was such as to render its receipt of the EUAs unconscionable. It was aware that Z might not have title to or authority to sell the EUAs but went ahead with the transaction, deliberately closing its eyes to that risk and failing to make the inquiries that an honest and reasonable person would have made (paras 278-285).

(6) If legal title to the EUAs remained vested in C then it had a good proprietary restitutionary claim. W's defence of bona fide purchaser without notice was defeated by the knowledge which it had for the purposes of knowing receipt. If change of position could be a defence to a proprietary restitutionary claim W did not act in good faith (paras 287-289).

(7) C's claim succeeded and it was entitled in principle to a money judgment in an appropriate sum (para.290).
