# Thorner v Major [2009] UKHL 18

FACTS: The claimant, David, worked on his cousin’s, Peter’s, farm for almost 30 years without payment. Peter and David were part of a community of farmers who were ‘taciturn and undemonstrative men’ and who communicated obliquely and allusively. In particular, Peter was a man of very few words who only communicated in an indirect manner. For example, if Peter said to David, ‘what are you doing tomorrow?,’ he meant (and David would understand him to mean) ‘would you come and help on the farm tomorrow?’

On Peter’s death, David brought a proprietary estoppel claim, alleging that Peter had made an assurance that he would give David the farm by his will.

The principal issue was whether David could establish the alleged assurance given that Peter had never explicitly said that he would give the farm to David.

David particularly relied on two features to establish the assurance:

- In 1990 Peter gave David documents relating to two assurance policies on Peter’s life. He said to David: ‘That’s for my death duties.’
- On various occasions, Peter mentioned features of the farm which were only relevant to a person who was to have a continuing involvement with the farm (because they had no other relevance at the time they were mentioned.)

HELD: The House of Lords reinstated the decision of the trial judge that, in light of the context, the features relied on by David amounted to an assurance by Peter that he would give the farm to David by his will. David’s claim was successful, and he was awarded the farm. The following features of the judgments are worth noting:

- The assurance need not be explicit. It can be inferred from indirect statements.
- The relevant assurance must be ‘clear enough’ and whether it is clear enough ‘is hugely dependent on context.’ (Lord Walker conceded that this is ‘a thoroughly question-begging formulation’.)
- The task of the court is to ascertain how the defendant’s words would have been reasonably understood by the claimant in the context in which they were spoken. Since David and Peter belonged to the same community of taciturn, undemonstrative men, ‘they were well able to understand one another.’

Lord Rodger neatly summarised the court’s approach:

> “It is sufficient if what Peter said was ‘clear enough.’ To whom? Perhaps not to an outsider. What matters, however, is that what Peter said should have been clear enough for David, whom he was addressing and who had years of experience in interpreting what he said and did, to form a reasonable view that Peter was giving him an assurance that he was to inherit the farm and that he could rely on it.”

## Summary

The Court of Appeal had been wrong to reverse a trial judge's decision that a sufficient assurance had been made by a landowner to his nephew to support the operation of proprietary estoppel so as to enable the nephew to inherit his uncle's land. The judge's findings of fact had not been open to challenge in the Court of Appeal, and there had been insufficient reason for that court to reverse them. The court considered the operation of proprietary estoppel generally and the necessary character or qualities that an assurance must have in order to be relied upon as proprietary estoppel.

## Abstract

The appellant (D) appealed against a decision (_[[2008] EWCA Civ 732](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I80D7026048C311DD915595BD2E222939/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1077616a91b94b7d8e83dd0205811508&contextData=(sc.Default))_) that proprietary estoppel could not operate in his favour so as to entitle him to inherit the estate of his deceased uncle (P).

At the time of his death in 2005, P had owned a farm of substantial value and also had considerable savings. He had made a will in 1997 leaving the residue of his estate, including his farm, to D but had subsequently destroyed the will and died intestate. D had worked at P's farm for no remuneration from 1976 onwards, and by the 1980s, he had come to hope that he might inherit the farm. No express representation had ever been made, but D relied on various hints and remarks made by P over the years, which he claimed had led him to believe that he was to inherit the farm. In 1990, P had handed D a bonus notice relating to two policies on P's life, saying “that's for my death duties”. It was D's case that at that point his hope had become an expectation. The judge at first instance had found that D had the benefit of proprietary estoppel because he had reasonably understood P's words and acts as an assurance that he would inherit the farm and that P had intended them to be understood in that way. The Court of Appeal had reversed that decision, finding that there had been no clear and unequivocal intention on the part of P and that there was no basis to construe P's statements as a definite assurance rather than a statement of present intention. The issues for the instant court were  
(i) the character or quality of the representation or assurance made to D;  
(ii) whether, if the other elements for proprietary estoppel were established, D must fail if the land to which the assurance related was inadequately identified or had undergone a change during the period between the giving of the assurance and its eventual repudiation.

D submitted that the Court of Appeal had been wrong to apply the “clear and unequivocal” test because it was not relevant to proprietary estoppel.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) To establish a proprietary estoppel, the relevant assurance had to be clear enough. What amounted to sufficient clarity depended on context, _Walton v Walton unreported_applied. There was some authority for the view that the "clear and unequivocal” test did not apply to proprietary estoppel, especially in Treitel, Law of Contract (12th edn. 2007) and at least the two earlier editions, and in _[Jones v Watkins [1987] 11 WLUK 299](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5DE74FC0F93811E08A4FB9BBBB2DE25A/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1077616a91b94b7d8e83dd0205811508&contextData=(sc.Default))_, Jones applied. There was a degree of unreality in making a distinction between the meaning of written words and the meaning of spoken words because in cases of the instant type, a judge's conclusion as to the meaning of spoken words would be inextricably entangled with his factual findings about the surrounding circumstances. In the instant case, the Court of Appeal had concentrated too much on the significance of the 1990 incident regarding the bonus notices and had not given sufficient weight to the advantage that the trial judge had had in seeing and hearing the witnesses. The 1990 incident had marked the transition from hope to expectation, but it had not stood alone, and the evidence had demonstrated a continuing pattern of conduct by P for the remaining 15 years of his life. It was not helpful to try to break that pattern down into discrete elements. There had been insufficient reason for the Court of Appeal to reverse the trial judge's careful findings and conclusion.

(2) Proprietary estoppel had to relate to identified property (usually land) owned or about to be owned by the defendant. The trial judge had made a clear finding of an assurance by P that D would become entitled to the farm. Both P and D knew that the extent of the farm was liable to fluctuate as development opportunities arose and tenancies came and went. There was no reason to doubt that their common understanding had been that P's assurance related to whatever the farm consisted of at P's death, Walton applied and _[Layton v Martin [1986] 2 F.L.R. 227, [1986] 1 WLUK 241](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6FAFCC90E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1077616a91b94b7d8e83dd0205811508&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Basham (Deceased), Re [1986] 1 W.L.R. 1498, [1986] 5 WLUK 173](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7019AFC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1077616a91b94b7d8e83dd0205811508&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
