# Polly Peck International plc v Nadir (No 2) [1992] 4 All ER 769

## Summary

Prior to the establishment of liability, the court will not grant a Mareva injunction which will interfere with the normal course of business, particularly where the cause of action is speculative.

## Abstract

P company brought an action against N, its erstwhile chief executive. P had become insolvent owing £550m. One of the defendants was the Central Bank of Northern Cyprus, who it was alleged had acted in breach of their judiciary duty in moving certain funds. The case pleaded was one of constructive trust in respect of £45m with a tracing claim in respect of £8.9m at the bank's account in London. P's administrators sought Mareva relief and an injunction to protect the £8.9m. The judge granted the Mareva injunction.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the court would not grant a Mareva injunction before liability was established if the injunction would interfere with the course of business, particularly where the cause of action was speculative;

(2) where liability as a constructive trustee was sought to be imposed on the basis of a misapplication of trust property, something amounting to dishonesty or want of probity had to be shown;

(3) where liability was on the basis of receiving and dealing with trust property, it had to be shown at the least that the defendant had knowledge that the funds were trust funds and that they were being misapplied (dictum in _Baden v Societe Generale du Commerce SA [1983] B.C.L.C. 325, [1983] 1 WLUK 9_ considered).
