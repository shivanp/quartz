# King v Dubrey [2015] EWCA Civ 581

It was argued that an elderly woman had made a deathbed gift of her home to her nephew 4-6 months before she died. She was also attempting to gift the home to him in a number of invalidly executed wills.

The Court of Appeal held that she had no reason to anticipate dying immediately. The gift had not been made in contemplation of death. Moreover, the fact that she had made subsequent wills was inconsistent with the idea that she had already disposed of her property.

## Summary

The case of _[Vallee v Birchwood [2013] EWHC 1449 (Ch), [2014] Ch. 271, [2013] 6 WLUK 116](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I155F72F0CF0111E2951396BAEF0308DF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=628aeaf890b64feca367f361de212fe7&contextData=(sc.Search))_ had been wrongly decided. In order for a donatio mortis causa to be established, a donor had to be contemplating his own death. However, that requirement was not satisfied in a situation where an elderly donor was approaching the end of his natural life span, but did not have a reason to anticipate death in the near future from a known cause.

## Abstract

Seven animal charities appealed against a decision (_[[2014] EWHC 2083 (Ch), [2014] W.T.L.R. 1411](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC0FF9EA0020411E482058881889440AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=628aeaf890b64feca367f361de212fe7&contextData=(sc.Search))_) that an aunt had transferred her house to her nephew by a donatio mortis causa. Alternatively, they appealed against a decision that the nephew was entitled to recover £75,000 against the aunt's estate as reasonable financial provision.

In March 1998, the aunt had made a will, leaving a number of modest legacies to friends and relatives and leaving the bulk of her estate to the seven charities. By 2007, the aunt was frail and elderly and the nephew went to live with her. Around November 2010, she presented the nephew with the title deeds to her house, saying: "This will be yours when I go". He claimed that her use of the words and the way she looked at him made it clear that she knew her health was failing and that her death was approaching. He took the deeds from her and put them in his wardrobe. The aunt died in April 2011. During the six months before her death, she signed three separate documents, purporting to leave her property to the nephew. None of the documents complied with the requirements of the [Wills Act 1837 s.9](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF8CB1280E44711DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=628aeaf890b64feca367f361de212fe7&contextData=(sc.Search)). The will of 1998 therefore took effect, but the court found that the aunt had effected a donatio mortis causa whereby her house had passed to him on her death. The judge held that if he was wrong about the donatio mortis causa, the nephew had a good claim against his aunt's estate under the [Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I604D2DF1E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=628aeaf890b64feca367f361de212fe7&contextData=(sc.Search)). He quantified that claim at £75,000.

The charities submitted that (1) the case of _[Vallee v Birchwood [2013] EWHC 1449 (Ch), [2014] Ch. 271, [2013] 6 WLUK 116](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I155F72F0CF0111E2951396BAEF0308DF/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=628aeaf890b64feca367f361de212fe7&contextData=(sc.Search))_ had been wrongly decided and there had been no effective donatio mortis causa; (2) if there had been no donatio mortis causa, the judge's award under the 1975 Act was excessive.

## Held

Appeal allowed in part.

(1) The doctrine of donatio mortis causa in English law was an anomaly. It enabled a deceased to transfer property without complying with any of the formalities of s.9 of the 1837 Act or the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.52](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38DB8620E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=628aeaf890b64feca367f361de212fe7&contextData=(sc.Search)). There was a need for the strictest scrutiny of the factual evidence and the courts should not allow the doctrine to be used as a device to validate ineffective wills.

Considerable caution was required because what a person said to those who were ministering to him in the last hours of his life might be a less reliable expression of his wishes than a carefully drawn will, prepared with the assistance of a solicitor and in the absence of beneficiaries. There were no such safeguards during a deathbed conversation. It was therefore important to keep donatio mortis causa within its proper bounds and resist the temptation to extend the doctrine to an ever wider range of situations. It was clear from the authorities that there were three requirements of a valid donatio mortis causa:  
(a) the donor had to contemplate his impending death;  
(b) the donor had to make a gift which would take effect only when his contemplated death occurred;  
(c) the donor had to deliver dominion over the subject matter of the gift to the recipient.

In Vallee v Birchwood, the first requirement was not satisfied. The donor, like many elderly people, was approaching the end of his natural life span, but he did not have a reason to anticipate death in the near future from a known cause. For that reason, that case had been wrongly decided, Vallee v Birchwood overruled (see paras [51-57, 60](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment). When the aunt had the crucial conversation with her nephew, she was 81 and it was obvious that most of her life was behind her, but there was no evidence that she was suffering from any specific illness. It could not be said that she was contemplating her imminent death at the relevant time. There was no reason why she should not have gone to her solicitors and made a new will. If she had taken that course, the solicitors would have ensured that she understood the consequences of the new will. Upholding the donatio mortis causa claim would bypass all of the safeguards provided by statute.

The first requirement of the donatio mortis causa doctrine was not satisfied. The second requirement was not satisfied either because the words used by the aunt were more consistent with a statement of testamentary intent than a gift which was conditional upon her death within a limited period of time. Further, the ineffective documents which the aunt signed indicated that she was trying to dispose of her assets by means of a will. They were inconsistent with the proposition that she had disposed of her assets by means of a donatio mortis causa. There had been no donatio mortis causa (paras [67-75](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(2) In relation to the nephew's claim for reasonable financial provision, the judge had taken account of all of the relevant factors. Evaluation of those factors was a matter for the first instance court. The judge had not made an error of law or arrived at a figure outside the permissible bracket. The instant court would not intervene (paras [77-82](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
