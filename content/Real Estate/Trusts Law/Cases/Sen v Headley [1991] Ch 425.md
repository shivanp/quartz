# Sen v Headley [1991] Ch 425

**FACTS:** A man dying from terminal cancer told his friend that his house was hers, giving her the keys to a steel box which contained the title deeds to the house.

**HELD:** The Court of Appeal held that there was a valid DMC of the house by constructive delivery of the title deeds via the keys to the steel box. The fact that she had keys to the house would not alone be enough, as this represents a right of access rather than ownership.

The doctrine of donatio mortis causa can apply to a gift of land. P and the deceased lived together as man and wife between 1954 and 1964. Thereafter they remained on close terms, the deceased continuing to be treated as a member of the family. In 1986 the deceased was diagnosed as having inoperable cancer. While in hospital, the deceased told P that the house was hers, and that she would find the deeds in a steel box to which she had the keys. The deceased died three days later. P bought an action against the deceased's estate, claiming to be entitled to the house on the basis of a valid "donatio mortis causa". The judge held that there could not be a valid donatio of land.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the doctrine applied to a gift of land if the gift was made in the contemplation of death, if it was made on condition that it was to be absolute on the donor's death, and there was delivery of the essential indicia of title (_[Birch v Treasury Solicitor [1951] Ch. 298, [1950] 11 WLUK 77](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I74B09D00E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8eb35bd32d9a4791b9e153dc5fc2d876&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
