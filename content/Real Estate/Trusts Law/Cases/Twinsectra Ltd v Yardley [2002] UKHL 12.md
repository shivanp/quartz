# Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12

#key-case

## Summary

Money held in the client account of a solicitor, S, was paid in breach of an undertaking to L, another solicitor, who paid it to his client, Y, who misused part of it. Although the money had been held on trust, L had not been guilty of dishonest assistance because he had honestly believed that the money was at Y's disposal and that any breach of undertaking was a matter between S and Y.

## Abstract

L, a solicitor, appealed against a finding of the Court of Appeal ([1999] Lloyd's Rep. Bank. 438) that he had dishonestly assisted in a breach of trust. L had acted for Y in the negotiation of a loan from T to Y, but had had no direct dealings with T. Another solicitor, X, who had also acted for Y, had given an undertaking to T in the following terms:

> "The loan moneys will be retained by us until such time as they are applied in the acquisition of property on behalf of our client. The loan moneys will be utilised solely for the acquisition of property on behalf of our client and for no other purposes".

Upon being assured by Y that he would use the loan money in the acquisition of property, X released the money to L, who paid it to Y, who in turn used a large part of it other than in the acquisition of property. The loan was not repaid and T issued proceedings against all the parties involved. T argued that the payment by X to L in breach of the undertaking amounted to a breach of trust in which L had dishonestly assisted.

Held, allowing the appeal (Lord Millett dissenting on the issue of dishonest assistance), that

(1) the money had been subject to a trust in T's favour. The terms of the trust were contained in the undertaking, whose effect was to provide that the money in X's client account should remain vested in T until it was used in the acquisition of property. The trial judge had erred in concluding that the words “the acquisition of property” rendered the undertaking too vague. A power would be sufficiently certain if the court was able to say that a particular application of the relevant money did or did not fall within its terms. In the instant case, there was no dispute that the money had not been used in the acquisition of property, _[Baden's Deed Trusts (No.1), Re [1971] A.C. 424, [1970] 5 WLUK 18](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6D7B1010E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8c444057fba3461eab00e1b9c09674c0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The trial judge had also erred in considering whether there had been an intention to create a trust. Whether a trust was created and the terms of the trust depended on the interpretation of the undertaking and any lack of intention on T's part to create a trust was irrelevant, and

(2) to justify a finding of dishonest assistance, the defendant had to have had a dishonest state of mind, in other words an awareness that he was transgressing ordinary standards of honest behaviour. In the instant case, L had believed that the money was Y's to do what he wanted with it; he had also believed that whether Y's use of the money would be contrary to the assurance that he had given to X and whether it would place X in breach of the undertaking were matters between him and X. L may have been wrong and misguided, but he had not been dishonest, _[Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 A.C. 378, [1995] 5 WLUK 382](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9062CDB1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=8c444057fba3461eab00e1b9c09674c0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
