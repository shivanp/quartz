# Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378

FACTS: The claimant airline appointed a company to sell tickets for its flights. The company agreed to hold the proceeds from the sale of the tickets on trust for the claimant. In breach of trust, the company applied the proceeds for its own purposes. The company went insolvent.

The defendant was the company’s managing director and principal shareholder. The claimant sued him for dishonest assistance.

HELD: The defendant was liable. He knew that the proceeds from the sale of the tickets were held on trust. And he caused the company to apply them for its own purposes and in breach of its duty to the claimant.

Lord Nicholls observed (at 389) that honest people do not misappropriate or misapply other people’s property, nor do they assist others to do so.

Where a third party dishonestly assists a trustee to commit a breach of trust, the third party is liable to the beneficiary for the loss occasioned by the breach even if the third party has not received any trust property and the trustee has not actually been dishonest. P appointed BLT as its agent. D was the managing director and principal shareholder of BLT. The agreement provided that BLT was to hold money on trust for P. In breach of trust, BLT used the money for its own purposes and did not pay it to P. BLT became insolvent and P commenced proceedings against D to recover the money. The judge found D liable as constructive trustee. The Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam reversed the decision on the basis that it had not been established that the company had been dishonest.

Held, allowing P's appeal, that D had dishonestly assisted the company to commit a breach of trust and so was liable to P regardless of the fact that there had been no dishonesty on the part of BLT and that D had not received the money himself. Honesty in this context was to be judged objectively; it equated to conscious impropriety or a reckless disregard of the rights of others rather than mere negligence or oversight. D had caused BLT to use money for its own purposes when he knew it was not entitled to do so. That amounted to dishonesty making D liable to P as a constructive trustee ( _[Barnes v Addy (1873-74) L.R. 9 Ch.
