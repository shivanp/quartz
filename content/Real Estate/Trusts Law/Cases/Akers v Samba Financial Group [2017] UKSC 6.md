# Akers v Samba Financial Group [2017] UKSC 6

## Summary

A transfer of shares held on trust, made after the commencement of the relevant company's winding-up, did not amount to a void disposition under the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.127](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6CD9101E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=69d38370e52f4617881796c0426e5e8f&contextData=(sc.Default)). The natural meaning of "disposition" in the context of s.127 was a transfer by a disponor to a disponee of the relevant property. In the instant case, that was the beneficial interest in the shares, and only the legal title to the shares had been transferred.

## Abstract

An appeal was brought against a decision concerning a disputed transfer of shares.

The respondents were a Cayman Islands company (S) and its joint liquidators. S's owner (X) had, in six transactions, declared himself a trustee of certain Saudi Arabian shares for S's benefit. Winding-up proceedings were commenced in the Cayman Islands against S on 30 July 2009; the English Companies Court had recognised those proceedings as a foreign main insolvency proceeding. On 16 September 2009, X transferred all the Saudi Arabian shares to the appellant bank, purporting thereby to discharge personal liabilities which he had towards the appellant. The liquidators considered that the disposition deprived S's creditors of the shares and claimed that the disposition was void under the [Insolvency Act 1986 s.127](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6CD9101E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=69d38370e52f4617881796c0426e5e8f&contextData=(sc.Default)). It was common ground that the law of Saudi Arabia, where the shares were sited, did not recognise the institution of a trust or a division between legal and equitable proprietary interests.

The issue was whether the share transfer was a disposition of property within the meaning of s.127.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

Where a trust existed, the legal and beneficial interests were distinct, and what affected the former did not necessarily affect the latter. Where an asset was held on trust, the legal title remained capable of transfer to a third party, although that undoubted disposition might be in breach of trust. But the trust rights, including the right to have the legal title held and applied in accordance with the terms of the trust, remained. They were not disposed of. They continued to be capable of enforcement unless and until the disposition of the legal title had the effect under the lex situs of the trust asset of overriding the protected trust rights. If the trust rights were overridden, it was not because they had been disposed of by virtue of the transfer of the legal title. It was because they were protected rights that were always limited and in certain circumstances capable of being overridden by virtue of a rule of law governing equitable rights, protecting in particular (under common law) bona fide third-party purchasers for value. In those circumstances, s.127 was neither aimed at nor apt to cover the present situation. It addressed cases where assets legally owned by a company in winding-up were disposed of. The holder of interests such as S's did not need protection on the lines of s.127 to protect its property or to protect or enforce its interests. X disposed of his legal interest in the shares. That involved him in a breach of trust. But it did not involve any disposition of S's property. S's property, whether it consisted of an equitable proprietary interest or personal rights to have the shares held for its benefit, continued, despite the disposal of the legal title, unless and until that disposal overrode it. If the disposal overrode S's interest as regards a third-party transferee of the legal title such as the appellant, that was not because of any disposal of S's interest. It was because S's interest was always limited in that respect. The natural meaning of "disposition" in the context of s.127 was a transfer by a disponor to a disponee of the relevant property (here the beneficial interest). There was no basis for extending s.127 to cover three-party situations where legal title was held and disposed of to a third party by a trustee, and the beneficiary's beneficial interest either survived or was overridden by virtue of the disposition of the legal title to the third party. The law regulated, protected and circumscribed beneficial interests under a trust in a manner which was separate from and outside the scope of s.127 (see paras [51, 53-56](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).
