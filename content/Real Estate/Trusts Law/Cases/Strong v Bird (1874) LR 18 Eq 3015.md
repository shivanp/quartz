# Strong v Bird (1874) LR 18 Eq 3015

**FACTS**: Bird had borrowed money from his step-mother. He had agreed to repay her by instalments. He paid two instalments, but she then orally agreed to forgive the debt. An oral release of debt is ineffective at law, and so on her death Bird still owed her estate the money. On her death, Bird was appointed executor of her estate.

**HELD:** The debt was released at common law by Bird's appointment as executor because, as the legal owner of the estate, he was both creditor and debtor. But this did not prevent equity from enforcing the debt.

However, Jessel MR held that equity would not enforce the debt if the creditor appointed the debtor as their executor and had manifested an unchanged intention during their lifetime to forgive the debt.

A testatrix lent a sum of money to her stepson. She later verbally forgave him the debt. She also appointed him as her executor. The English Court held that the appointment of the stepson as executor had released the debt at law, and any claim in equity had been rebutted by evidence of a continuing intention on the part of the testatrix to give.
