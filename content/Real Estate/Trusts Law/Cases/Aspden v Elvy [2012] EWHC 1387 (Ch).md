# Aspden v Elvy [2012] EWHC 1387 (Ch)

## Summary

The claimant had a 25 per cent interest in a barn owned by the defendant, a woman with whom he had previously cohabited, by virtue of substantial contributions which he had made to its conversion.

## Abstract

The claimant (X) brought proceedings against the defendant (E) alleging that he was entitled to a beneficial interest in a converted barn on the basis of a constructive trust and/or proprietary estoppel.

X and E had met in 1985. From 1986, they lived together in a farm bought by X until their separation in late 1995 or early 1996. The parties remained in contact: they had two children together, and E ran a cattery and kennel business from the premises. The farm premises included a derelict barn with planning permission for conversion to a dwelling. By a transfer dated January 2006, X transferred the barn to E, who became the registered proprietor. The barn was converted to a house between 2006 and 2009. It was now worth around £400,000. It was common ground that X had made a substantial financial contribution to the cost of the conversion works.

X argued that he had contributed to those works pursuant to a common intention that the parties would marry and cohabit as a family or a belief on his part that that was the position. E denied that that was the case and argued that the payments made by X constituted gifts which recognised her contributions to the family.

## Held

Judgment for claimant.

E had become the legal and equitable owner of the barn in January 2006. The transfer of the barn by X was and was intended to be an outright transfer of his legal and beneficial interest in it; there was nothing in his words or conduct that would justify the inference that there was any common intention that he should retain any interest in the barn. The evidence indicated that X's financial contribution towards the conversion was between £65,000 and £70,000. There had been no express discussions that X should obtain an interest in the barn. Thus, in order to succeed in establishing an implied trust he had to show that the common intention was that he should have an interest as a result of the substantial contributions, both in financial and in physical terms, that he had made to the works. E's contention that the contributions were intended as gifts could not be accepted: the money involved represented a very substantial part of X's assets at the time. If they were intended as gifts, he would in effect have left himself with nowhere to live except the caravan in which he had been staying; X did hope and expect to be able to live in and have an interest in the barn when it was complete, and E was fully aware of that. The proper inference from the whole course of dealing was that there was a common intention that X should have some interest in the barn as a result of the very substantial contributions made to the conversion works, _[Bernard v Josephs [1982] Ch. 391, [1982] 3 WLUK 326](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I73F8BEB0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=209872099f9b4bf498f636f06721f0c0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.

A fair assessment of that interest was 25 per cent. X's claim based on proprietary estoppel would result in the same outcome. There were no express representations but E stood by and encouraged X to carry out the work and invest £65,000 to £70,000 in it knowing that the investments were not intended to be gifts and that X did hope and expect to be able to live in and have an interest in the barn. In those circumstances, an equity arose. The valuation of the equity required justice to be done having regard to the proportionality between the expectation and the detriment; a 25 per cent share in the barn satisfied that test (see paras [118-119, 122-125, 128-129](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).
