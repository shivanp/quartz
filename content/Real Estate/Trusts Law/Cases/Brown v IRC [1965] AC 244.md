# Brown v IRC [1965] AC 244

Interest on clients' money which a solicitor deposits in his own name in a bank deposit account belongs to the client and so is not the solicitor's income and cannot support a claim by him for earned income relief. A solicitor made a practice of depositing in a deposit account with a bank in the firm's name GBP 5,000 of his client's account whenever it was in credit to more than that amount and appropriating the interest on the deposit account. He also accepted deposits with himself at a low rate of interest, and lent them out at a higher rate to clients of the firm and kept the difference between the interest he paid and that he received. On a claim by him for earned income relief on the profits so made, held that the interest on the deposit account with the bank belonged to the clients and the claim failed.
