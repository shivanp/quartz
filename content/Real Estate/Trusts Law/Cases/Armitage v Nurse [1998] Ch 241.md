# Armitage v Nurse [1998] Ch 241

Held, that a clause in a settlement providing that a trustee was exempted from liability for loss or damage to the fund or its income "unless such loss or damage shall be caused by his own actual fraud" could validly exclude liability for gross negligence. For a trustee to be guilty of fraud, there had to be a fraudulent intention and proof of dishonesty, _[Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337, [1889] 7 WLUK 3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I985F4990E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5db8fe4cba164ddfa44a182d7711e9bc&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, so that even if trustees deliberately committed a breach of trust, if they did so in good faith, honestly believing that they were acting in the best interests of the beneficiary, there could be no fraud. Provided a trustee was not dishonest the clause exempted him from liability, even though he may have been idle, imprudent, careless or wilful in discharging his functions.

A clause purporting to exclude liability for everything except actual fraud was not repugnant or contrary to public policy. There was a core of obligations that beneficiaries had to be able to enforce against trustees in order to give effect to the trust, but these obligations did not include the duties of skill, care, prudence and diligence. Further, there was no distinction between negligence and gross negligence under common law so as to allow gross negligence to be equated with fraud.
