# Starglade Properties Ltd v Nash [2010] EWCA Civ 1314

FACTS: Larkstore Ltd held money on trust for the claimant as part of a broader commercial arrangement. Nash was Larkstore’s sole director. Nash knew that Larkstore was unable to pay its debts. He caused Larkstore to pay the trust money to Larkstore’s unsecured creditors.

He did so to ‘frustrate’ the claimant, because he considered that the claimant had unfairly imposed the commercial arrangement on Larkstore. Nash did not know that there was a trust. He believed that the claimant was an unsecured creditor of Larkstore. His object was to reduce the assets available for distribution in a winding up. The claimant sued Nash for dishonest assistance.

HELD: Nash was liable. He caused the company to misapply the trust property and he did so dishonestly.

Morritt C said that the ‘deliberate removal of the assets of an insolvent company so as entirely to defeat the just claim of a creditor’ was inconsistent with ‘ordinary standards of honest commercial behaviour.’

It did not matter that Nash was unaware that the arrangement between Larkstore and the claimant had given rise to a trust. Objectively, a trust had arisen and had been breached by Larkstore. Nash had assisted the breach of trust and was found to have done so dishonestly.

## Summary

In a claim alleging dishonest assistance in a breach of trust, the judge had erred in holding that the test to find dishonesty was whether a person had been guilty of conduct that all, as opposed to some, people would consider dishonest. The relevant standard was the ordinary standard of dishonest behaviour; it was irrelevant that there might be a body of opinion which regarded the ordinary standard as being too high.

## Abstract

The appellant company (S) appealed against a decision (_[Starglade Properties Ltd v Nash [2010] EWHC 148 (Ch), [2010] W.T.L.R. 1267](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I02DDB3320B0511DF8C00E9CD77FBE106/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b0ed0505e6884cab948c3f33874e6006&contextData=(sc.Default))_) to dismiss its claim alleging that the respondent former company director (N) had dishonestly assisted in a breach of trust.

A company (L) controlled by N had issued proceedings against a third party. L agreed to hold money obtained in the proceedings on trust for division between itself and S. By the time L received the money it was insolvent. N distributed the money on L's behalf to various creditors, excluding S. S issued proceedings against L, but N had L dissolved, and he was substituted for L as the defendant. S claimed restitution of its share of the money on the basis that N had dishonestly assisted L in a breach of trust. The judge found that N had wanted to frustrate S because he felt that it had taken unfair advantage of him. He found that N had discussed the enforceability of L's agreement with S with his solicitor and had asked if he could lawfully avoid paying S and prefer other creditors. He held that if N had been advised that that would be unlawful, he would not have gone ahead. The judge found that there had been a breach of trust and that N had assisted in its commission. However, holding that the test for dishonesty was whether the defendant had been guilty of conduct that all normal people would regard as dishonest, he concluded that the test had not been met. He held that, the legal position on preferring creditors not being generally known, there was not a general view on what was dishonest in that situation, so N's conduct did not transgress generally accepted standards of commercial behaviour.

S argued that (1) the judge's view that the standard of honesty concerned what all, as opposed to some, normal people would regard as dishonest was wrong; (2) the judge had failed correctly to apply the law on dishonesty to the facts.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) The relevant standard was the ordinary standard of honest behaviour. Just as the subjective understanding of the person concerned as to whether his conduct was honest was irrelevant, so also was it irrelevant that there might be a body of opinion which regarded the ordinary standard of honest behaviour as being set too high. Ultimately, it was for the court to determine what that standard was and to apply it to the facts of the case, _[Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12, [2002] 2 A.C. 164, [2002] 3 WLUK 573](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF41FF00E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b0ed0505e6884cab948c3f33874e6006&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed, _[Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 A.C. 378, [1995] 5 WLUK 382](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9062CDB1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b0ed0505e6884cab948c3f33874e6006&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Barlow Clowes International Ltd (In Liquidation) v Eurotrust International Ltd [2005] UKPC 37, [2006] 1 W.L.R. 1476, [2005] 10 WLUK 204](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6F7A1460E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b0ed0505e6884cab948c3f33874e6006&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered (see paras [25, 28-29, 32](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The judge's conclusion had related to the honesty of whether a director could prefer some creditors over others and he had considered that that might depend on the advice received. That was the wrong question. N's concern had not been to prefer some creditors over others but, as the judge had found, to frustrate S. N had known that L was insolvent but that L's obligation to S was binding. He could only frustrate S by leaving it to pursue its remedy against an insolvent company without assets. He could only remove L's assets by paying its other creditors. That was what he had done. He could not be protected from the course of that conduct by the solicitor's advice. He had not asked the solicitor or been advised as to the legality or otherwise of the payments actually made. The judge had never considered whether N's conduct in seeking to frustrate S had been dishonest. The deliberate removal of the assets of an insolvent company so as to entirely defeat the just claim of a creditor was not in accordance with the ordinary standards of honest commercial behaviour. Nor could a person in N's position have thought otherwise, notwithstanding a lack of understanding as to the legal position. N's assistance of the breach of trust had been dishonest (paras [34-35, 39-40](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). (3) It would be of concern if the concept of dishonesty for the purposes of civil liability differed to any marked extent from that concept as understood in the criminal law, TanTwinsectraBarlow Clowes_[Abou-Rahmah v Abacha [2006] EWCA Civ 1492, [2007] 1 All E.R. (Comm) 827, [2006] 11 WLUK 139](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFA3B6880707A11DB941BDB22558C2F6B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b0ed0505e6884cab948c3f33874e6006&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[R. v Ghosh (Deb Baran) [1982] Q.B. 1053, [1982] 4 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I472988A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b0ed0505e6884cab948c3f33874e6006&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. It was therefore important that the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) should revisit the issue (paras [42-44](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
