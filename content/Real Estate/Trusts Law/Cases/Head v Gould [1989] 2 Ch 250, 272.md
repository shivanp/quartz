# Head v Gould [1989] 2 Ch 250, 272

The Chancery Division held:

(i) where one of two trustees by whom a breach of trust was committed was a solicitor, that solicitor could not be required to indemnify his co-trustee where that co-trustee had himself been an active participator in the breach of trust and had not participated in it merely in consequence of the solicitor&#x2019;s advice and control; and

(ii) in order to make a retiring trustee liable for a breach of trust committed by his successor, it should be proved that the very breach of trust was not merely the outcome of or rendered easy by the retirement and new appointment, but was contemplated by the former trustee when the retirement and appointment took place.
