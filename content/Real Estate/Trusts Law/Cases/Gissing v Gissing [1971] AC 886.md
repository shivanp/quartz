# Gissing v Gissing [1971] AC 886

Where the matrimonial home was conveyed into the name of one spouse only and there was no agreement or understanding or expression of intention that the other spouse, though she had contributed, should have a beneficial interest therein, the law of trust would apply to resolve the entitlement of each spouse. The respondent made no direct contribution towards the purchase of the matrimonial home. She, however, spent her own money on furniture, improvement of the lawn and the family's clothes. The parties got married in 1935, purchased the house in 1951 and the respondent obtained a decree absolute in 1966.

Held, that it was not possible to draw an inference that there was any common intention that the respondent should have any beneficial interest in the matrimonial home.
