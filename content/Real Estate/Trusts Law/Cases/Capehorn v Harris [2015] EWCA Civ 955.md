# Capehorn v Harris [2015] EWCA Civ 955

## Summary

A judge's decision concerning the beneficial ownership of a family home was overturned because she had elided the two-stage analysis necessary to determine whether a common intention constructive trust had arisen between the unmarried cohabitees.

## Abstract

The court was required to determine whether the respondent (H) had acquired a beneficial interest in property owned by the appellant (C).

C and H had lived together for 20 years. C took over H's frozen food business after he was made bankrupt. Ten years after the beginning of their relationship, C purchased a property (Sunnyside). The property was purchased with an interest-only mortgage in C's sole name, and the deposit came from her business earnings. She later purchased another property (Beaumont). H set up his own company. The relationship between the parties began to break down. C asserted that she had agreed to transfer her business to H's company in exchange for a weekly payment of £750. She moved out of Sunnyside, and H continued to live, and run the frozen food business, there. H paid C £750 per week for several years. He asserted a beneficial interest in Sunnyside. The judge concluded that there was no agreement that H should have a beneficial interest in Sunnyside, but she concluded that by reason of H's contribution to the business, he had acquired a beneficial interest of 25 per cent. She also found that H held the issued shares of the company on trust for himself and C with a 65:35 split in his favour.

## Held

Appeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed.

(1) In relation to unmarried cohabitees, where an asset was owned in law by one person, but another claimed to share a beneficial interest in it, a two-stage analysis was necessary to determine whether a common intention constructive trust had arisen. First, the person claiming the beneficial interest had to show that there was an agreement that he should have a beneficial interest, even if there was no agreement as to the precise extent of that interest. Second, if such an agreement could be shown to have been made, but there was no agreement on the extent of the interest, the court could impute an intention that the person was to have a fair beneficial share in the asset, _[Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546, [2005] Fam. 211, [2004] 5 WLUK 99](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I15C110D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7567cb3f7e2d4d809efcbc64ed6e5427&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Stack v Dowden [2005] EWCA Civ 857, [2006] 1 F.L.R. 254, [2005] 7 WLUK 317](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB85C1C41E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7567cb3f7e2d4d809efcbc64ed6e5427&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53, [2012] 1 A.C. 776, [2011] 11 WLUK 241](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I89AC8D700ADE11E1ACE2AD2704BF921B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7567cb3f7e2d4d809efcbc64ed6e5427&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The court was not entitled to impute an intention to the parties at the first stage in the analysis; an actual agreement had to be found to have been made (see paras [16-17](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment). (2) The judge had erroneously elided the two stages. She had imputed an intention to the parties for the first stage of the analysis rather than identifying an actual agreement that H should have any beneficial interest in Sunnyside. No actual agreement to that effect had ever been made between the parties. C was the sole legal and beneficial owner of Sunnyside and Beaumont. H had no valid claim to a beneficial interest in either of those properties (paras [18-23](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). (3) H was the sole legal and beneficial owner of the shares in the company, and C had no beneficial interest in them. She had sold the business to H's company in 2007 in return for a payment by H of £750 per week. The company was the sole owner of the business, and C had no beneficial interest in the business or the company. The payment of £750 per week was agreed to last while H was in occupation of Sunnyside or until the interest-only mortgage expired in 2019, whichever was sooner. There was a strong probability that Sunnyside would have to be sold by C in 2019 in order to repay the mortgage, as contemplated by the parties (paras [24, 26, 28](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
