# Re Macadam [1946] Ch 73

A testator who died in 1922 directed that, in the event (which happened) of his pre-deceasing his brother, his trustees should be bound to accept, in satisfaction of the amount due to him, at the date of his death, under a partnership contract with his brother, shares in a limited company to be formed for the purpose of acquiring the business. The company was formed in 1926. A summons was taken out by the two trustees of the will, who had been duly appointed directors of the company in 1941 and 1944 respectively, to determine whether they were liable to account to the estate for remuneration received by them from the company in respect of the office of director. The Chancery Division held that although the remuneration was for services as directors of the company, the opportunity to obtain that remuneration was gained as a result of a discretion vested in the trustees, and they were liable to account to the trust estate for the sums received by them as remuneration for those services.
