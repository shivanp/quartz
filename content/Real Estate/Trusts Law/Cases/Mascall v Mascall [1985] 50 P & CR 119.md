# Mascall v Mascall [1985] 50 P & CR 119

The father handed the son the signed transfer deed and land certificate, which was sent by the son’s solicitors to the Stamp Office. The father and son quarrelled and the father wanted to revoke the gift. The transfer had not yet been registered and so legal title had not yet passed to the son.

Applying _Re Rose:_

1. The correct method of transfer had been used (a signed transfer deed).
2. The father had not done everything within his power to effect the transfer because he had not sent the transfer deed and land certificate to the Land Registry. Was giving them to the son enough?
3. The documentation had therefore not ended up in the hands of the person capable of effecting the transfer.

HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the gift was complete in equity and so could not be revoked by the father. The fact that the documents had not yet been sent to the Land Registry did not prevent the gift being complete in equity. By sending the documents to his son, the father had given the intended transferee everything he needed to complete the transfer for himself. The son could go on and have the property registered in his name.

This case is important because it extended the Re Rose principle to registered land. It also established that is not necessary for the transferor to send the documents to the person capable of completing the transfer. If the correct method of transfer has been used, the transfer will be irrevocable if the transferor puts the matter beyond their own control. By giving the documentation to the son, the father had put the matter beyond his own control and the gift was therefore irrevocable.

Where the owner of property intends to make a gift of that property, executes a transfer and sends the relevant documents to the Stamp Office, there is a completed gift in favour of the donee. In 1976 P bought a house in which he wished his daughter to live. The daughter did not comply with P's wish. Thereafter, P intended to sell the property. D, P's son, said he would buy it for GBP 9,000, the price P had paid for it. P said D could have the house and that he did not want D's money. The trial judge held that there was an intention from 1976 onwards on the part of P to let D have the beneficial use of the house. The house remained in P's name until 1981 when D persuaded P to transfer it into D's name. P instructed solicitors to deal with the matter and told them to avoid incurring any liability for “gift tax”. With that aim, it was decided that the house should be transferred to D for a consideration of GBP 9,000. P duly executed a transfer of the house to D. The transfer acknowledged receipt of the sum of GBP 9,000 by P. P gave D the land certificate relating to the house. D sent the transfer and land certificate to the Stamp Office. Thereafter, P and D quarrelled. P had the land certificate and transfer returned to him by the Stamp Office. D had not paid any sum to P for the house. P sought a declaration that the transfer was void and of no effect, and that he was not bound to transfer the house to D. The trial judge found for D.

Held, dismissing P's appeal, that P had done everything in his power to transfer the house to D. He had intended to do it. He had executed the transfer and handed over the land certificate. P was not obliged to register D's title at the Land Registry, that obligation lay upon D. The transfer and land certificate were documents belonging to D that P had no right to retain. In the circumstances there was in equity a completed gift in D's favour (_[Milroy v Lord 45 E.R. 1185, [1862] 7 WLUK 110](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICAC08CE0E57211DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=645dd0a77e0745ab90e1477ffd9de4d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ explained, _[Rose (Deceased), Re [1952] Ch. 499, [1952] 4 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8F993C20E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=645dd0a77e0745ab90e1477ffd9de4d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
