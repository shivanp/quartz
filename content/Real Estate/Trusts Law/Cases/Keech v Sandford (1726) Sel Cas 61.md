# Keech v Sandford (1726) Sel Cas 61

FACTS: A trustee held a commercial lease on the terms of a testamentary trust for a minor beneficiary. When the lease came to an end, the trustee attempted to renegotiate it on behalf of the beneficiary, but the lessor was not willing to re-let the property to the trustee in that capacity because the beneficiary was a minor. The landlord was, however, willing to assign the lease to the trustee personally and did so.

HELD: The beneficiary made a successful claim for breach of fiduciary duty. The trustee had exploited an opportunity which came to them as a result of their position. The rules are so strict that the trustee was held to be the ‘one person in the whole of mankind’ who was not entitled to the renewed lease. The trustee was therefore required to assign the lease to the beneficiary and account for the profits made.

The lease of a market was devised to a trustee for the benefit of an infant. Before the expiration of the lease, the trustee applied to the lessor for a renewal for the benefit of the infant. The lessor refused to renew for the infant for various reasons but granted a renewal to the trustee for himself. The Lord Chancellor's Court held that the trustee should assign the lease to the infant and account for the profits for if a trustee on the refusal to renew might have a lease to himself, few trust estates would be renewed to the cestui que use. Although there was no fraud in the instant case, the trustee should rather have let the lease run out than have had it renewed to himself.
