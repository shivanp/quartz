# Re Hallettâ€™s Estate (1880) 13 Ch D 696

The Court of Appeal, Civil Division, held that if money held by a person in a fiduciary character, though not as trustee, had been paid by him to his account at his bankers, the person for whom he held the money could follow it, and had a charge on the balance in the bankers' hands. If a person, who held money as a trustee or in a fiduciary character, paid it to his account at his bankers, mixed it with his money, and then drew out sums by cheques in the ordinary manner, the rule in Devaynes v Noble, Clayton's Case (1816) 1 Mer 572 did not apply. The drawer should be taken to have drawn out his own money in preference to the trust money.
