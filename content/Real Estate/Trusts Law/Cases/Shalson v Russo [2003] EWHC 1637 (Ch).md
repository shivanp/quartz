# Shalson v Russo [2003] EWHC 1637 (Ch)

## Summary

Where a party was fraudulently induced by another to lend money, a constructive trust in favour of the lender did not automatically arise and, since the contract was voidable, the lender could not advance a proprietary claim to the money entitling him to trace it into other assets before having rescinded the contract.

## Abstract

The part 20 claimant, M, claimed money judgments against R and an entitlement to trace USD 7.5 million through W, a bank under R's control, and into a valuable motor yacht. R had practised frauds on M and induced him to advance monies. Monies were paid by M into W's account with P, a Swiss bank. M claimed that the issuing of his Part 20 claim, following discovery of the fraud, amounted to an implied rescission of the loan contracts. M submitted that the effect of rescission was to revest in him the title to the money he had been induced to advance, carrying with it a right to trace it onwards. M submitted that even though W's current account with P was overdrawn at the time of payments in he was still entitled to trace through it because the account was in credit if deposit and current accounts were consolidated.

Held, giving judgment for M in part, that M's tracing claim failed. Following the discovery of R's fraud, M's issuing of a Part 20 claim evinced an intention to rescind the loan contracts. Rescission was effective to revest in M title to the money advanced, entitling him to trace it into assets into which it was subsequently applied, _[Banque Belge pour l'Etranger v Hambrouck [1921] 1 K.B. 321, [1920] 11 WLUK 26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6F0A89B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e6935dd6867a4e5ebacd04e22f4f3b97&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. However, it was only possible to trace into assets and not net assets. There was no justification for the suggested consolidation of accounts. The current account was in overdraft, a feature resulting in W incurring a liability to pay interest charges to P. The deposit accounts were in credit, but they were quite separate accounts held at other institutions, and were held not in the name of W but in that of P. All M's money had done was to reduce a liability, _[Box v Barclays Bank Plc [1998] Lloyd's Rep.
