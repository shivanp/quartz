# Re Good’s Will Trusts

In Re Good’s Will Trusts a trust to provide rest homes in Hull was found to be too specific to demonstrate a general charitable intention. The testator had created detailed plans relating to the management of the homes which the court found to be inconsistent with a general charitable intention.

There could therefore be no cy-près application of the funds when they transpired to be insufficient for the intended purpose.
