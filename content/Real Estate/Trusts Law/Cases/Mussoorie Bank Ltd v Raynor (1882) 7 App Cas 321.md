# Mussoorie Bank Ltd v Raynor (1882) 7 App Cas 321

The wife, by her will, gave to her son shares in the Delhi and London Bank. The wife died. The appellant bank instituted suits against the wife's executors to recover the sum it advanced to her upon the security of the shares. In the first suit, the appellant obtained a decree under which the bank's shares were attached. The second was a mortgage suit. The son successfully applied to set aside the decree. The appellant presented a petition for leave to appeal, which stated the mortgage suit and the effect of the High Court's decree therein, but it did not give the date of that decree. It was not true that the shares were attached under the decree in the mortgage suit.

The Privy Council held that any such petition was liable to be rescinded with costs if it contained any misstatement or any concealment of facts which ought to be disclosed. However, as there was no intention to mislead, the appeal would be allowed but without costs.
