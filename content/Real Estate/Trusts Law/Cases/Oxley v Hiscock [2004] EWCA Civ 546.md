# Oxley v Hiscock [2004] EWCA Civ 546

## Summary

In proceedings under the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 s.14, where there was no evidence of any discussion between the parties as to the extent of their respective beneficial interests in the proceeds of sale of a property, the court had to have regard to the whole course of dealing between them in relation to the property and decide what would be a fair share for each of them.

## Abstract

H appealed against a finding that his former cohabitee, O, was entitled to a half share in the proceeds of sale of the property in which they had lived together. O and H had had a relationship from the mid 1980s until 2001 but had never married. In 1986 O had purchased the council house in which she was living at a discount price under the "right to buy" provisions of the [Housing Act 1985](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60168D90E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b6fec69b6a6043249c982d144030b75f&contextData=(sc.Default)). H provided the whole purchase price of GBP 25,200, which was secured by way of a charge since the property was conveyed into O's sole name. In 1991 that property was sold and the property which was the subject of the current proceedings was purchased in H's sole name for GBP 127,000. GBP 30,000 of that sum was provided by way of a loan in H's name secured by mortgage, GBP 36,300 was contributed by O from the proceeds of sale of the previous property and GBP 60,700 was contributed by H, which included the GBP 25,200 due to him from the previous property. In 2001 the parties separated and the property was sold for GBP 232,000. From the proceeds H gave O the equivalent of her original investment in the property, in the region of GBP 36,300, but kept the remainder. O brought proceedings, arguing that she was entitled to a half share as the intention had always been that the property would be jointly beneficially owned. The judge found for O, holding that such an intention could be inferred from the parties' conduct. On appeal, H argued that the judge had taken the wrong approach and that O's share should be by way of resulting trust calculated solely on her actual financial contribution.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that the judge had taken the wrong approach and a fair division of the proceeds was 60 per cent to H and 40 per cent to O. The authorities in this area of law were to some extent unclear, and the judge had based her decision on a somewhat outdated and "artificial" approach in which the conduct of the parties throughout the relationship was used to piece together an inferred intention at the time the property was purchased. Where, as in the instant case, there was some evidence that the parties had intended some form of shared ownership but had not discussed in what proportion those shares should be, they were each "entitled to that share which the court considers fair having regard to the whole course of dealing between them in relation to the property". The judge had wrongly dwelt on conduct going towards intention instead of stepping back and looking at it from the point of view of overall fairness. Although O and H's cohabitation had involved a "classic pooling of resources", H's greater financial contribution had to be taken into account and an equal split would therefore not be fair.
