# Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (No 2) [1973] Ch 9

- Sachs and Megaw LJJ concluded that ‘relative’ should be defined as persons who ‘trace descent from a common ancestor.’  
- Stamp LJ adopted a narrower definition and defined it as meaning ‘next of kin.’ He considered this to be conceptually certain as the term has a specific legal definition in the intestacy context.

The more difficult issue which confronted the Court of Appeal was the question whether a discretionary trust requires both conceptual and evidential certainty. A discretionary trust clearly requires conceptual certainty, as the trustees cannot perform their obligations to survey the potential class of beneficiaries if they do not know how that class is defined.

However, as noted above, it is unnecessary to draw up a complete list of beneficiaries, so does this mean that evidential certainty is also unnecessary?  

The three judges gave quite different views on this point:

- Stamp LJ’s judgment involves a literal application of the is/is not test. He held that the trust would fail for uncertainty of objects if a person came forward of whom it was not possible to determine, as a matter of fact, whether they were or were not within the class. In other words, he concluded that evidential uncertainty renders a discretionary trust void.
- Megaw LJ disagreed with Stamp LJ. He concluded that a discretionary trust would be certain if it could be shown that a ‘substantial number’ of persons definitely fell within the class, even though it may be uncertain as to whether others fell within it or not. He indicated that what constitutes a substantial number depends on the facts of the case.
- Having noted that the class was conceptually certain, Sachs LJ considered that it is for an individual claimant (i.e., potential beneficiary) to prove that they are within the class. This is a question of evidence. Where a claimant does not prove themselves to be within the class, they are outside of it. It makes no difference to the validity of the trust whether they are proved positively to be outside the class or merely fail to prove that they are within the class. In both cases, that individual claimant is excluded from benefiting and the trustee need not consider them.

Sachs LJ’s approach is widely considered to be the most pragmatic. It provides a practical solution to the evidential (un)certainty problem and prevents discretionary trusts failing for uncertainty of objects.  

It also accords with the view of Brightman J at first instance that a trustee could only make distributions to a person who proved that they were within the class of beneficiaries.

A trust, like a power, is valid if it can be said with certainty that any given individual is or is not a member of the class of beneficiaries. A deed recited that a settlor would transfer to trustees shares in a company to form the nucleus of a fund for the benefit of its staff, their relatives and dependants. Cl.9(a) provided:

> “The trustees shall apply the net income of the fund in making at their absolute discretion grants to or for the benefit of any of the officers and employees or ex-officers or ex-employee of the company or to any relatives or dependants of any such persons in such amounts at such times and on such conditions (if any) as they think fit …”

The settlor's executors claimed payment of the fund to his estate, alleging that cl.9(a) was void. The trustees took out a summons, joining the executors as defendants, for determination of certain questions as to construction of the deed. Goff, J. held that the provisions of cl.9(a) constituted a power and not a trust and as such were valid.

On appeal the Court of Appeal upheld the decision in favour of a power but held that Goff, J. had applied the wrong test of validity, the correct test being that in _[Gulbenkian's Settlement Trusts (No.1), Re [1968] Ch. 126, [1967] 6 WLUK 3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB5ABBEC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6794b2ebfa7447e1ada587553062ef00&contextData=(sc.Default))_, decided after Goff, J.'s judgment, and so remitted the case to the Chancery Division for consideration on the validity of cl.9(a).

On appeal by the executors, the House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal, held that cl.9(a) constituted a trust and remitted the case to the Chancery Division for a decision on the clause's validity on that basis.

On the remitted hearing the question arose whether the test in _[Inland Revenue Commissioners v Broadway Cottages Trust [1955] Ch. 20, [1954] 7 WLUK 86](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC6ABB451E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6794b2ebfa7447e1ada587553062ef00&contextData=(sc.Default))_ still applied to ascertain the validity of a trust or whether the test was the same as applied in Gulbenkian to ascertain the validity of a power. Brightman, J. held that the effect of the House of Lords decision was to overrule the Broadway Cottages test and to make that in Gulbenkian apply equally to trusts as to powers, a trust was valid if it could be said with certainty that any given individual was or was not a member of a class of beneficiaries, and accordingly the clause was valid as a trust.

On appeal by the executors, held, dismissing the appeal, that in applying the test in Gulbenkian as to the validity of a discretionary trust, it was necessary to distinguish between conceptual uncertainty and evidential difficulty; if a candidate could not establish that he was a member, then he must be held not to be a member. There was no conceptual uncertainty attaching to the words “dependants” or “relatives”, and accordingly the clause was valid.
