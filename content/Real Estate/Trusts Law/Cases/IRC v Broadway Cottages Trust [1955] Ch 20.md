# IRC v Broadway Cottages Trust [1955] Ch 20

## Abstract

A trust for such members of a given class of objects as the trustees shall select is void for uncertainty unless the whole range of objects eligible for selection is ascertained or capable of ascertainment. Cl.1 of a settlement defined the objects of its powers and trusts by reference to a schedule in which the class defined comprised members who, it was common ground, were unascertainable at any given moment. It was therefore agreed that cl.4 declaring the trusts relating to the capital of the trust fund, the interests in which by cl.5 were absolute interests, was void for uncertainty. Cl.8 contained an imperative direction to the trustees to distribute the whole of the income from the trust funds among such members of the unascertainable class as they might in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion think fit. The taxpayers, who were some of the beneficiaries under the settlement, were trusts established for charitable purposes only. They applied to have their claims for exemption from income tax under the Income Tax Act 1918 s.37(1)(b) in respect of certain sums of money which they alleged to be their income in the years 1950-51 and 1951-52 determined by the Commissioners.

Held, the trust was not one which the court could control or execute; this objection could not be met by urging the improbability of assistance by the court ever becoming necessary; the court would not be executing the trust merely by ordering a change in the trusteeship; the "relations" cases were in a class by themselves and provided no assistance in the present case; it would not be possible here for the court to create an arbitrarily restricted trust to take effect in default of distribution by the trustees; the trusts were void for uncertainty. _[Morice v Bishop of Durham 32 E.R. 947, [1805] 3 WLUK 11](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I56B11810E57211DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=37f80822a0d34b4e984a9284d9bd4678&contextData=(sc.Default))_; _[Gestetner Settlement, Re [1953] Ch. 672, [1953] 4 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAE6A23E0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=37f80822a0d34b4e984a9284d9bd4678&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Ogden, Re [1933] Ch. 678, [1933] 3 WLUK 31](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I124B23F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=37f80822a0d34b4e984a9284d9bd4678&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
