# Claytonâ€™s Case (1816) 1 Mer 529

On the death of a partner in a banking-house, the surviving partners carried on the business without changing the firm, and they later became bankrupt. The Exchequer bills deposited with the partnership were sold in the deceased partner's life-time and the produce applied to the use of the house. The Rolls Court held that the deceased partner's estate was responsible in respect of the breach of trust, and it was not discharged by subsequent acts from which an inference might have been drawn of the creditor's adopting the surviving partners as his debtors.
