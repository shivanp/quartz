# Re Llewellin’s Will Trusts [1949] Ch 225

It is a general principle of equity that a trustee may not profit from his trust. Thus, if a trustee of shares in a company by virtue of the control over the company which those shares give him gets himself appointed to the post of director or managing director, then, although his remuneration is not paid to him in respect of the trust holding but in respect of the work he does as director or managing director, yet, because he gains that emolument by virtue of the trust holding, he is not entitled to retain the remuneration for his own benefit. But there is no rule of equity which says that a testator, if so minded, may not provide that his trustees can hold salaried offices in companies which the testator's estate controls and receive the emoluments attached to those offices without liability to account. Thus, where a testator by his will empowered his trustees to retain shares in a certain company for so long as they thought fit and to make such arrangements as they thought fit for their appointment as director or managing director, those offices being, under the terms of the articles, remunerated or potentially remunerated offices, it was held that the trustees were entitled to arrange with the company not only for their appointment as managing director and director of the company, but also for their remuneration in those capacities and, further, that they were entitled to retain that remuneration for their own benefit without being liable to account to the testator's estate.

Testator, who was a director of a company incorporated in 1927 for the purpose of carrying on a business which he had previously carried on as sole proprietor since 1882, by his will empowered his trustees

> ‘to make such arrangements with the said company … for the appointment of my said trustees or either of them or any other persons as a director or managing director of the said company in my place.’

Two of the trustees became directors after the death of the testator and a summons was taken out by them to determine whether they were accountable to the estate for remuneration received by them as directors: Held on the true construction of the will they were entitled to retain the remuneration without being accountable to the estate in respect thereof.
