# Trustee role

## Role

The role of trustee is fundamental to the existence of a trust.

The role will vary depending on the nature of the trust. However, the role of the trustee, at its core, is always to hold property for the benefit of others.

Trustees will usually be the legal owners of the trust property. They have all the rights and powers of the legal owner, while the beneficiary has the equitable and beneficial interest in that property. This is the property component of the trust.

The trustee must exercise the rights of legal ownership for the benefit of the beneficiary. They owe obligations to the beneficiary, which can be enforced personally against the trustee. This is the obligation component of the trust.

## Categories

The obligations of trustees must be determined on an individual basis, but it is possible to identify some broad categories of trust and comment on the core role of the trustee:

### Express Trusts

There are many different types of express trust, under which the obligations of trustees vary significantly. What they have in common is that the trust has been expressly created, meaning an obligation has been intentionally imposed upon the trustee.

We can break this category down further, considering how the role of trustee varies depending on the nature and purpose of the trust:

#### Testamentary and Other Family Trusts

Trusts are often set up in a will or for other family purposes. The trustee’s main role will be to comply with the terms of the trust, ensuring that the right payments are made to the right people at the right time. Sometimes these trusts will only last a short period of time, as once the trustee has distributed the entire trust fund, the trust comes to an end. In other cases, the trust will need to last for a longer period of time. A good example is a trust which has minor beneficiaries, which may well need to stay in play for many years. In such cases, the trustees will have more active management obligations. They will need to safeguard and invest the trust fund. The trustees of such trusts will generally be lay trustees, meaning they act voluntarily and are not paid.

#### Trusts for Commercial Purposes

There are many different commercial reasons for setting up a trust, meaning the role of trustee can vary significantly. It may involve minimal input from the trustee or may involve complex investment of the trust fund, such as with pension trusts and other investment funds. Such trusts are likely to have extensive rules relating to the administration of the trust and the trustee's will.

Such trusts will often have professional trustees. Unlike lay trustees, they are paid to perform their role. Because of the payment, and their greater expertise, professional trustees will be held to a much higher standard of care than lay trustees.

#### Charitable Purpose Trusts

Charity trustees have extensive obligations, many of which are specifically prescribed by statute. The extent to which the trustees are involved in the active, day to day, management of the charity will depend on the size of the charity. Small charities will usually be managed by the trustees themselves, while larger charities will have employees. In such cases, the role of trustees is more strategic than operational. They will be responsible for establishing and overseeing the structures put in place to ensure the charity operates in accordance with the terms of the trust and complies with charity law. Charity trustees are often lay trustees, but will be selected based on their particular skills and experience. Again, this is relevant when considering the standard of care to which they are held.

#### Bare Trusts

Bare trusts are not a completely separate category of trust. You can find examples of bare trusts in both the family and commercial context. A bare trust is a trust in which the trustee has very limited obligations. They simply hold the legal title to the trust property on behalf of adult beneficiaries, who have fully vested interests. The beneficiaries have [[Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav 115]] rights and can collapse the trust whenever they wish. All the trustee needs to do is distribute the trust property in accordance with the trust terms or the instructions of the beneficiaries.

### Trusts Arising by Operation of Law

#### Resulting and Constructive Trusts

Unlike express trusts, resulting and constructive trusts are imposed by law. They do not result from an express intention to impose an obligation upon the trustee (and may arise even if they have expressed a contrary intention). They arise to correct a wrong or unfairness and do not impose the same sorts of obligations on trustees. The proprietary component of the trust is key.

#### Statutory Trusts

Some trusts arise as a result of the operation of statute and impose extremely limited obligations on the trustee. A good example is trusts of land, which arise in any case where land is jointly held. Again, the focus here is on the proprietary component of the trust.

## Role of Trustee

### Voluntary

The obligations of a trustee are onerous, therefore as a general principle no one is required to accept the office of trustee. So, for example, just because a person is named as trustee in a will does not mean that they are required to take on that responsibility. They can refuse, and an alternative trustee will be appointed instead. It is a key principle of trust law that Equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee.

### Typically Unpaid

As the role of trustee is a voluntary position, it is traditionally unpaid. So trustees take on the responsibility of their role for no remuneration (although they are able to recover expenses). Professional trustees are, however, entitled to payment for their services. As we will see in this topic, they are held to a higher standard of care than lay trustees.

### Joint Office

 It is good practice for trusts to have more than one trustee. Where there are multiple trustees, they must act together. All trustees should take an active role in the trust, and failure to do so may result in them being liable for breach of trust. Where there has been a breach of trust, the trustees who are found to have committed a breach will be jointly and severally liable.

### Broad Powers Curtailed by Duties

Although the settlor has significant discretion as to the precise duties of a trustee, it is not possible to have a trust in which the trustees have no enforceable obligations at all. For the trust mechanism to work, there must be an obligation component.

A general duty to act honestly and in good faith, for the benefit of the beneficiaries, is common to all trusts. This is often described as the ‘irreducible core’ of trustee duties and is fundamental to the [[concept of a trust]].
