# Express trust formalities

## Trusts of Land

The formalities for declaration of a trust of land set out in s 53(1)(b) LPA 1925 are explored.

### Statute

> [!statute] s 53(1)(b) LPA 1925
> 
> A declaration of trust respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person who is able to declare such trust or by his will.

### Details

Although it is generally possible for a settlor to declare a trust without complying with any specific formalities requirements (see e.g., [[Paul v Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527]]) there are specific rules applicable to the declaration of trusts of land.

- “Manifested and proved”: s 53(1)(b) is an evidential requirement only. This means:
	- The declaration and the writing need not be contemporaneous. The order in which they take place is unimportant
	- The trust will be unenforceable unless and until s53(1)(b) is satisfied.
- “Some writing”: There is no prescribed form for the written evidence. All that is needed is something in writing which provides evidence of:
	- The settlor’s intention to create the trust, and
	- The terms of the trust.
- “Signed by some person who is able to declare such trust”: Although the signature will usually be that of the settlor, it is arguable that the trustee (being the legal owner) can also provide the written evidence.
	- This point is not settled, and it is preferable to seek directions from the court in situations where the trustee considers doing so.
- “By will”: Section 53(1)(b) expressly provides for the possibility that a trust of land is created by will.
	- As long as the will is validly executed i.e., complies with s 9 Wills Act 1837, this will be sufficient to satisfy s53(1)(b).

### Non-compliance with S 53(1)(b)

Non-compliance renders the trust unenforceable rather than void. This is crucial:

- An unenforceable trust exists from the moment it is declared, but the beneficiary cannot enforce their rights unless and until s53(1)(b) is satisfied.
- A void trust does not come into existence at all.

Once the trust becomes enforceable, the beneficiaries can enforce their rights in respect of the period between declaration and satisfaction of s53(1)(b).

> [!example]
> Consider a life interest trust of land which is declared in January but evidenced six months later, in June:
> 
> The life tenant is entitled to the income produced by the land between January and June. Once the trust becomes enforceable, the life tenant can sue to enforce this interest. The trustee can also be sued for any other breaches of trust between January and June.

### Unenforceable Trusts

We have considered the effect of time passing between declaration of the trust and satisfaction of s53(1)(b) LPA 1925, but what if those formalities are never satisfied?

As a basic rule, the answer is that the trust will simply not become enforceable. This gives the settlor a chance to change their mind about parting with beneficial ownership.

In cases involving a gratuitous self-declaration of trust over land, the settlor can simply choose not to create the signed, written evidence of the declaration. In the absence of any facts rendering it unconscionable for the settlor to deny the trust (such as [[proprietary estoppel]]) the beneficiary will not be able to assert any interest in the land.

In cases involving an intended transfer on trust:

- If the settlor changes their mind and makes no attempt to constitute it, the trust will not only be unenforceable under s53(1)(b) but also void for lack of constitution. Again, this is subject to any additional circumstances which may make it unconscionable for the settlor to deny the existence of the trust.
- If the settlor transfers legal title but does not comply with s53(1)(b) it would be prudent for the trustee to seek directions from the court as to their obligations.

## Constitution of Trusts

> [!defn]
> **Constitution** is the transfer of legal title from one party to another, which is necessary in order to make a transfer on trust or a gift binding. 

> The settlor must have done everything which, according to the nature of the property comprised in the settlement, was necessary to be done in order to transfer the property and render the settlement binding upon him.  
> Lord Justice Turner, [[Milroy v Lord (1862) 31 LJ Ch 798]]

A transfer on trust requires the legal title in the property to be vested in the trustees. This is known as ‘constituting’ the trust. Transfer of legal title is also required for a gift to be made from a donor to a donee.

A self declaration of trust does not require any movement of the legal title as legal title to the property is already vested in the settlor. This means that the trust is automatically constituted when the trust is declared.

| Scenario                  | Constitution rules?                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transfer on trust         | Constitution rules apply                                      |
| Gift                      | Constitution rules apply                                      |
| Self declaration of trust | Automatically constituted so no constitution rules necessary. |

### Testamentary Vs Lifetime Constitution

If a trust is created in a will (a testamentary trust) then constitution will take place via the will. After the death of the testator, their personal representatives must obtain legal title to the testator’s estate.

When they are ready to distribute the estate, the personal representatives must ensure that legal title is transferred to the recipients of any testamentary gifts and the trustees of any testamentary trusts. If the personal representatives have also been appointed as trustees, they will already have legal title and will now hold it in their capacity as trustees.

In a lifetime trust (also known as an *inter vivos* trust), legal title must be transferred using the correct method. The formalities for transferring legal title will vary according to the nature of the property in question.

### Transferring Legal Title

| Asset                                                             | Transferring title                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Registered land                                                   | Transfers must be made by deed under [s 52(1) LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/52) and registered with the Land Registry under [s 27 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/27). Legal title passes on registration of the new owner at the Land Registry.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Shares in a private company                                       | Transferred by the transferor signing a stock transfer form and sending it to the company. (It is also common for the company to require the share certificate or an indemnity in respect of the transferor’s ownership as part of this process.) Legal title passes when the transferee is registered in the company’s internal register of members. |
| Choses in action (e.g., debts and money in a bank account)        | Transferred by notice in writing to the debtor or to the bank (see [s 136 LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/136)). Legal title passes once notice has been received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Chattels (including physical cash)                                | May be transferred either (i) by deed of gift or (ii) by delivery of the chattel with evidence of the transferor’s intention to transfer it ([[Re Cole [1964] Ch 175]]).                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Cheques (and other bills of exchange) in favour of the transferor | May be transferred to a third party (i.e. someone other than the named payee) by the transferor endorsing the cheque by signing their name on the back according to the [Bills of Exchange Act 1882](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61). See e.g., [[Jones v Lock (1865) LR1 CH App 25]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Effect of Constitution

The effect of constitution is that the disposition is irrevocable.

Once a trust is constituted, the settlor ceases to have any beneficial or legal interest in the trust property (providing all other requirements for creating the beneficiary’s interest have also been satisfied). The trustee has legal title and holds it on trust for the beneficiary.

The same is true of gifts. Once the donee has legal title, the donor has no more rights to that property and cannot ask for it to be returned.

> [!example]
> Jamal asks Paul to hold some shares on trust for Sian. Jamal transfers legal title to Paul. Once Paul is registered as the shareholder, the trust is completely constituted and Jamal cannot revoke it.

> [!example]
> Ariana receives a watch from Tarek as a gift. Later they argue and Tarek tells Ariana to give it back. The gift was perfected on delivery. Tarek can’t change his mind so Ariana can keep the watch.

### Failed Constitution

If trust property is not vested in the trustees, the trust is incompletely constituted and is therefore void. In the case of a gift, if legal title has not passed to the donee the gift is imperfect and the donor can change their mind.

Usually no consideration is given in the creation of a trust and so the beneficiary of a trust and the recipient of a gift are both volunteers. Equity will not assist a volunteer by compelling the settlor/donor to transfer legal title to the trustee/donee. This is an example of the equitable maxim, ‘equity will not assist a volunteer’.

The leading case on constitution is [[Milroy v Lord (1862) 31 LJ Ch 798]] establishing that ‘equity will not perfect an imperfect gift’ or treat a failed gift as a self-declaration of trust.

### Rule in *Milroy V Lord*

Turner LJ at the Court of Appeal noted three methods of transferring property:

1. An outright gift
2. A transfer on trust
3. A self declaration of trust

He made clear that the transferor must do “everything necessary” to effect the intended disposition by following the correct method for transferring legal title. If they fail to do so, equity will not perfect the disposition or treat the transferor as having used one of the other methods.

If a donor intends to make a gift but fails to transfer legal title, they will not be treated as having made a self-declaration of trust. The transferor did not intend to take on the obligations of trusteeship and should not be treated as having done so.

Similarly, if a settlor fails to constitute a transfer on trust, they will not be interpreted as holding the trust property for the intended beneficiary. They did not intend to take on this obligation and will not be treated as having done so.

> [!example]
> Jamal asks Paul to hold some shares on trust for Sian. Jamal forgets to complete the stock transfer form and so Paul is not registered as the shareholder. Jamal dies and leaves the shares to Dhan as a gift in his will. The trust is void because it was imperfectly constituted. Dhan will receive the shares under the will.

> [!example]
> Tarek says he is going to send Ariana a watch as a gift. Later they argue and Tarek tells Ariana he won’t be sending the watch. Whilst Tarek intended to make a gift of a chattel, he did not deliver it and so legal title has not transferred to Ariana. Tarek can change his mind. Ariana has no rights over the watch.

### Constitution and Certainty of Intention

Constitution is intrinsically linked with [[certainty of intention]]. If legal title to property has not been transferred to a trustee (for a transfer on trust) or to a donee (for a gift), the court needs strong evidence that the owner intended to declare themselves a trustee. The court must be satisfied that the owner intended to take on the onerous obligation of trusteeship and divest themselves of beneficial ownership.

Contrast the outcomes in [[Jones v Lock (1865) LR1 CH App 25]] and [[Richards v Delbridge (1874) LR 18 Eq 11]] with [[Paul v Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527]], where an effective declaration of trust was found despite the fact that Mr Constance was seemingly unaware of what a trust was.

See also the Privy Council case [[Choithram v Pagarani [2001] 1 WLR 1]].

## Milroy V Lord Exceptions

The effect of the rule in *Milroy v Lord* is that if legal title has not been vested in the intended recipient, the disposition will fail. There are three possible lines of exceptions to this rule:

1. Principle in Re Rose
2. Fortuitous Vesting
3. Donationes Mortis Causa

### Re Rose Exceptions

> ‘Although the principles that Equity will not assist a volunteer and will not perfect an imperfect gift are fundamental, Equity recognises a further qualifying principle, namely that ‘Equity will not strive officiously to defeat a gift’.’  
> The Principles of Equity and Trusts, Graham Virgo, 3rd Edition

Following Milroy v Lord, the general rule is that equity will not perfect an imperfect gift. This means that a disposition will fail unless legal title has been vested in the intended recipient. According to Turner LJ the owner must do: “everything necessary to be done”.

> [!note]
> The rule in Re Rose can be used to perfect both gifts and trusts.

This has subsequently been interpreted to mean that the transferor must do everything within their own power to transfer legal title. As such, even if the transfer of legal title has not occurred, equity may regard the transfer of the equitable interest in the property as complete.

In [[Re Rose [1952] Ch 499]] the Court of Appeal held that a transfer of shares was effective in equity once the transferor had done “everything in his power” to vest the shares in the transferees.

#### Extensions

In [[Mascall v Mascall [1985] 50 P & CR 119]] the Re Rose principle was applied by the Court of Appeal to the gift of registered land from a father to his son. This case is important because it extended the Re Rose principle to registered land. It also established that it is not necessary for the transferor to send the documents to the person capable of completing the transfer. If the correct method of transfer has been used, the transfer will be irrevocable if the transferor puts the matter beyond their own control.

> [!example]
> Narinder wishes to transfer shares to Sergei to hold on trust for Karim. Narinder completes the stock transfer form and gives this to Sergei with the share certificate. Sergei is not yet registered as the shareholder. Narinder dies and leaves the shares to Muhammed as a gift in his will. Narinder’s personal representatives are unsure whether to transfer the shares to Sergei or to Muhammed.
> 
> The basic rule in Milroy v Lord is that the trust is void because it was imperfectly constituted. Following Re Rose, if Narinder did everything in her power to transfer the shares to Sergei, the transfer will be complete in equity. Whilst she has used the correct method of transfer, the documents have not ended up in the hands of the person capable of effecting the transfer (the Company Registrar). However, by giving Sergei the stock transfer form and share certificate, Narinder has given him the means to effect the transfer of the legal title. Therefore, following Mascall v Mascall, Narinder (and consequently her personal representatives) holds the shares on a constructive trust for Sergei pending the transfer of legal title, who in turn holds that equitable interest on trust for Karim.

It can be seen that by using Re Rose and Mascall v Mascall together, a transfer is irrevocable if the matter is put beyond the control of a transferor.

In contrast, if the transferor had sent the documents to their own agent, such as their solicitor or their accountant, that would not be sufficient as agency is revocable.

[[Re Fry [1946] Ch 312]] offers an example of a situation where the matter was within the control of the transferor. The transfer of shares required consent from the Treasury because the transferor was domiciled abroad. This was not obtained before the transferor’s death, and so the transferor was ineffective.

A further example can be found in [[Zeital v Kaye [2010] ECWA Civ 159]]. Here the owner of an absolute equitable interest in a shareholding had not done everything in his power to transfer his interest when he handed over the stock transfer form signed by the registered shareholder but not the share certificate.

Under the principles in Re Rose and Mascall v Mascall the transfer documents must either have been sent off for registration or delivered to the donee in order for the disposition to be irrevocable.

#### Pennington V Waine

In [[Pennington v Waine [2002] EWCA Civ 227]] the Court of Appeal indicated that equity would perfect an imperfect gift in any situation where it would be unconscionable for the donor to resile from it, concluding that was the case here.

Pennington v Waine is difficult to reconcile with the other case law in this area, and seems to have relied heavily on taking dicta in [[Choithram v Pagarani [2001] 1 WLR 1]] about ‘unconscionability’ out of context.

Obiter comments in [[Zeital v Kaye [2010] ECWA Civ 159]] and [[Curtis v Pulbrook [2011] EWHC 167 (Ch)]] suggest it will only be followed where the facts are similar to Pennington itself. The decision may be better explained by the doctrine of [[proprietary estoppel]].

> [!info] Proprietary estoppel
> [[Proprietary estoppel]] arises if there is:
> - an assurance (Harold was assured that Ada would give the shares to Harold)
> - reliance (Harold relied on this assurance by becoming a director)
> - detriment (He took on the burdens of directorship)
> 
> If proprietary estoppel is established, it would be unconscionable to go back on the assurance. However, an award by the court is based on the 'minimum equity required to do justice' (the court has a discretion to award the remedy which it considers most appropriate). So unlike the rule in Re Rose, a proprietary estoppel does not necessarily a constructive trust.
> 
> See Briggs J in [[Curtis v Pulbrook [2011] EWHC 167 (Ch)]] at [43].

> [!summary]
> - Exceptions have developed to mitigate the harshness of the rule in [[Milroy v Lord (1862) 31 LJ Ch 798]].
> - [[Re Rose [1952] Ch 499]] applies if 
> 	1. the correct method of transfer is used
> 	2. the transferor has done everything in their power to effect the transfer and 
> 	3. the documentation ends up in the hands of the person/organisation capable of effecting the transfer.
> - [[Mascall v Mascall [1985] 50 P & CR 119]] extends the Re Rose principle to registered land and says that the second limb of Re Rose is not necessary if the transferor has ‘put the matter beyond their control’ as this make would make a transfer irrevocable.
> - If Re Rose or Mascall v Mascall apply the donor will hold the property on a constructive trust for the intended donee.
> - [[Pennington v Waine [2002] EWCA Civ 227]] appeared to stretch the exception further, applying it to any cases where it would be ‘unconscionable’ to resile from the transfer. This case is generally regarded as confined to its own facts. It is unlikely that it would be applied unless the facts of a future case were very similar (although the doctrine of proprietary estoppel may also apply in such cases).

### Death of Transferor Exceptions

Although a failed gift or an incompletely constituted trust cannot be saved by treating the donor or settlor as an express trustee of the property, simply because this will not have been intended, Equity has found other ways of fulfilling the settlor’s or donor’s intention.

### Fortuitous Vesting

In some cases, a failure to perfect the intended recipient’s title may be cured if they obtain legal title through another route. This exception is called fortuitous vesting because legal title vests in the recipient in another capacity.

This will usually occur because the intended recipient of a gift is also the personal representative of the transferor’s estate. On the transferor’s death, legal title to all their property will transfer to their personal representative to administer their estate. If their personal representative was also the intended recipient of an imperfect gift, this gift may be perfected on the death of transferor.

> [!example]
> Diane intends to give Ciara an antique sword but Diane dies before this is delivered to Ciara and so legal title has not transferred to her. Ciara is named as executor in Diane’s will. Ciara will obtain legal title to the antique sword as executor. The gift to Ciara will be perfected via fortuitous vesting because Ciara has obtained legal title in her capacity as executor.

Fortuitous vesting is commonly known as the rule in [[Strong v Bird (1874) LR 18 Eq 3015]]. Whilst this case established the rule which is commonly applied to gifts, the case was actually about forgiving a debt.

[[Re Stewart [1908] 2 Ch 251]] extended the principle in Strong v Bird to perfect imperfect gifts. This case also confirmed that Strong v Bird will apply even if the intended recipient is one of several executors.

> [!test] Rule in Strong v Bird
> The following conditions must be met in order for the Rule in Strong v Bird to apply:
> 1. There must be an intention to make an immediate gift ([[Re Freeland [1952] Ch 110]])
> 2. The intention must continue until the donor’s death ([[Re Gonin]])
> 3. The intended donee becomes an executor (or one of the executors) of the donor’s estate ([[Re Stewart [1908] 2 Ch 251]])

#### Extension to Administrators

If a person dies without making a will, they are said to die intestate. On their death, an administrator is appointed by the court in order to administer their estate. In contrast, a person who makes a will can appoint executors to administer their estate.

In [[Re James [1935] Ch 449]] the rule in **Strong v Bird** was held to apply where the donee was appointed administrator. This therefore extends the principle of fortuitous vesting to include personal representatives appointed independently of the donor, which some commentators consider unjustifiable.

> [!note]
> Walton J doubted that Strong v Bird applied the daughter (appointed administratrix) in obiter in Re Gonin. He argued that in these circumstances the donor has no responsibility for making the donee administrator so Strong v Bird should not apply.
> 
> These comments were obiter because the court had found no continuing intention to give the house to the claimant in any event. The British Virgin Islands Court of Appeal applied Walton J’s remarks in [[Re Pagarini [1999] 2 OFLR 1]].

### Donationes Mortis Causa

A gift made in contemplation in death (traditionally known as a ‘donatio mortis causa’ or ‘deathbed gift’) is the final exception to Milroy v Lord. As a hybrid between a lifetime gift and a testamentary gift, it does not fully comply with the rules for either.

This exception is utilised in circumstances where a person contemplates their imminent death and wishes to leave their property to another person, but does not have time to execute a will. They may also not have time to effectively transfer legal title and if they don’t know when they are going to die, they might not want to part with the property just yet.

It is an anomalous exception which only applies in very specific circumstances, i.e., where the donor does not have time to make a valid lifetime disposition or create a valid will transferring the property to the intended recipients. They also must comply with strict conditions.

> [!test] Donationes Mortis Causa conditions
> [[Cain v Moon [1896] 2 QB 283]] sets out the following requirements:
> 1. The gift is made in contemplation (though not necessarily expectation) of death from an identifiable cause which the donor believes to be imminent ([[King v Dubrey [2015] EWCA]])
> 2. The gift is conditional on death (i.e. it is not intended to be fully effective until then and can be revoked before death);
> 3. There is delivery of the property; the donor must part with ‘dominion’ (control) of the property by handing it, or something which represents title (not simply possession) to the donee. ([[Sen v Headley [1991] Ch 425]])

> [!example] Invalid DMC
> Nico promises Elena his vintage Porsche when he dies. The next day Nico dies in a car accident. There is no DMC. Nico has no reason to anticipate dying and the gift isn’t conditional on his death, nor has the car been delivered.

> [!example] Valid DMC
> Nico is racing one of his cars in a rally the next day. He gives his vintage Porsche to Elena saying, “if I die tomorrow, the Porsche is all yours.” This is a DMC. Nico is anticipating his death and delivers the car to Elena. His words (“if I die”) make the gift conditional. Elena can only keep the car if Nico dies.

### Delivery and Passing of Dominion

In the case of a chattel, delivery (with intention) is sufficient to pass title to the donee and they will be entitled to keep the property after the donor’s death. However, for other types of property (such as land, shares or bank accounts) more must be done to transfer title.

A valid DMC does not require full transfer of legal title provided the donor parts with control (‘dominion’) of the property. If all requirements of a valid DMC are present the donee may request that the donor’s personal representatives then complete the transfer legal title to them.

Passing of dominion can also be constructive, as [[Sen v Headley [1991] Ch 425]] illustrates.

> [!summary]
> - Fortuitous vesting and donationes mortis causa are both exceptions to the rule in Milroy v Lord which apply on the death of the donor.
> - Fortuitous vesting is also known as the rule in Strong v Bird and it operates where a gift is made to a donee who subsequently obtains legal title to it by becoming the donor’s personal representative.
> - In order for the rule in Strong v Bird to operate there must be a continuing intention to make an immediate gift to the intended donee who becomes the executor/one of the executors under the donor’s will.
> - Donationes mortis causa are recognised in exceptional circumstances where a donor anticipates dying and wants to make a gift but does not have time to make a valid will.
> - A valid donatio mortis causa will be recognised where the donor is contemplating their imminent death, expresses the intention that the gift is conditional on their death and parts with dominion of the property.

## Virgo

There are two processes to consider:

- Possible formalities relating to the creation of the trust itself (e.g., need to evidence the transaction in writing, need to register the trust).
- Possible formalities for the transfer of property to the trustee (e.g., completion and submission of paperwork to a third party).

This second stage is called 'constituting' the trust. A trust can only be effective once the property has been validly transferred to the trustees.

### Formalities for Trust Creation

#### By a Settlor

For trusts of personalty, such as money, shares and chattels, writing is not required and an oral declaration of trust is sufficient ([[Paul v Constance [1977] 1 WLR 527]]). Declaration of trusts of land or interests in trust must be proved in signed writing by the settlor (s 53(1)(b) LPA 1925). But such signed writing is not required for resulting, implied or constructive trusts of land (s 53(2) LPA). If express trusts are not proved by signed writing, the trust is unenforceable rather than void. This means the trust is valid but cannot be enforced by the beneficiary. So the trustees cannot be compelled to fulfil their trust obligations if they do not wish to do so. Since writing is not needed to create the trust, the declaration of trust need not itself be in writing, and the written evidence need not be contemporaneous with the declaration of trust ([[Taylor v Taylor [2017] EWHC 1080 (Ch)]]). Although the signature will normally be that of the settlor, it can be that of the trustee ([[Gardner v Rowe]]).

### By a Testator

Trusts of land declared by will must be evidenced by signed writing. Any testamentary formalities must be complied with (e.g., need two witnesses present at the time to attest and sign the will).

#### Registration

Note that all express trusts must be registered under the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

### Formalities for Trust Constitution

For a trust to be effective, it is not enough simply to declare the trust, it is also necessary to ensure that the title to property has been vested in the trustee or trustees. This process of vesting is known as 'constituting' the trust. Where a trust is not effectively constituted, a body of law has developed whereby Equity may be able to intervene and validate the trust.

#### Timing

Note that the declaration of trust and its constitution need not be contemporaneous. So if the trust has been declared, but the trust has not been constituted, the settlor can still change their mind about creating the trust before it has been validly constituted. Once the trust is constituted, the settlor cannot recover property that has been transferred.

#### Modes of Disposing Property

1. Transfer of legal ownership beneficially (gift)
	- The transferor may intend to transfer property to the transferee absolutely, so the transferor divests themselves of legal ownership and the other party take the property beneficially
	- Where there is an intention to transfer property absolutely to the transferee, there will be no intention on the part of the transferor that the property should be held on trust.
	- If the transferor agreed to give the property to the transferee but failed to do so, Equity will not generally be in a position to help the transferee.
	- Equity will not assist a volunteer; Equity will not perfect an imperfect gift.
2. Transfer on trust
	- The transferor may intend to transfer legal or equitable title to property to the transferee to be held on trust either for the transferor or a third party.
3. Declaration of self as trustee
	- Here the owner of the property will become the trustee of it
	- Owner will retain legal title but will no longer have a beneficial interest in it, which will then be with the beneficiary.
	- Or could decide to hold property on trust for themselves and another.

### Constituting Express Trust

#### Self-declaration as Trustee

- In these cases, the trust will be automatically constituted because title to the trust property will already be vested in the settlor.
- If there is more than one proposed trustee, it does not matter that property is not vested in the other trustees ([[Choithram v Pagarani [2001] 1 WLR 1]]). Here the trust was constituted immediately when the settlor declared he gave his estate to the foundation. It would have been unconscionable for him to deny the trust. Had the settlor survived, he would have been obliged to ensure legal title was vested in all the trustees.

#### Vesting of Title in Trustees

The formalities required for this depend on the nature of the trust property. So for example, chattels are transferred either by a deed of gift, or an intention to give coupled with a delivery of possession.

Note that if the settlor is already the beneficiary of a trust, they can declare a trust of their equitable interest and have this interest held on trust by trustees for other beneficiaries. But since this requires the assignment of an existing equitable interest to the trustees, it requires writing. In [[Kekewich v Manning]], shares were held on trust for A for life with remainder to B absolutely. B assigned his equitable interest in the remainder to C to hold on trust for D.

Importantly, this validly constituted trust **cannot** be revoked ([[Re Bowden]]). It is irrelevant that the trustees and beneficiaries have not provided any consideration for the constitution of the trust ([[Paul v Paul]]).

The precise moment at which a trust is validly constituted may be of significance ([[Re Ralli's Will Trusts]]). It is the fact of legal title vesting in the trustee that constitutes the trust, regardless of the reason why legal title was vested in the trustee.

### Incompletely Constituted Trusts

When a trust is not completely constituted, it cannot take effect as an express trust. Equity might still be able to rescue something from the apparently failed transaction, but to do so a doctrinal hurdle needs to be surmounted: that Equity will not assist a volunteer.

This provides no problems when the trust has been constituted, since this has the effect that the beneficiary can obtain the benefit of the trust regardless of being a volunteer. But where the trust has not been constituted, the lack of consideration provided by the intended beneficiary means they have no right to enforce. Equity makes an analogy to the failed gift.

### Failed Trusts

General rule: Equity will not assist a volunteer ([[Milroy v Lord (1862) 31 LJ Ch 798]]). Here the settlor purported to transfer shares to Lord by deed to be held on trust for the claimant. The settlor handed Lord the share certificates, but this was not sufficient to vest legal title in him. Even though Lord had a power of attorney as the settlor's agent, this power was not exercised. Since legal title to the shares had not been vested in Lord, the trust had not been validly constituted, so was not valid. The power of attorney did not help, since this was held as the settlor's agent.

### Failed Gifts

If a donor purports to make a gift before their death and fails to do everything at Law to transfer title to the donee, the court will not compel the personal representatives of the donor to complete the act that the donor failed to do ([[Re Rose [1952] Ch 499]]). Where a gift is imperfect, the court will not give a benevolent construction to the donor's words so that an intention to make a gift is treated as though the donor had declared themselves a trustee, since becoming a trustee involves assuming onerous obligations in relation to property.

#### Saving Failed Trusts and Gifts

"Equity will not strive officiously to defeat a gift" – [[Choithram v Pagarani [2001] 1 WLR 1]]. This applies whether the gift is an outright gift to the donee or a gift held on trust for the beneficiaries.

#### Doing Everything Necessary

Where the settlor/ donor has done all necessary to transfer title to the trustee or donee, but this has not happened for reasons outside the control of the settlor/ donor, then although at Law the settlor/ donor retains legal title, Equity will assume title has passed to the trustee/ donee. So then there's a situation where legal title remains with the settlor/ donor, but equitable title is with the intended trustee/ donee. So there's a trust! And it arises from operation of law, so it is a constructive trust. The beneficiary of the trust can then seek the transfer of the property to them (using Saunders v Vautier rights).

This rule is well illustrated using [[Re Rose [1952] Ch 499]]. The court held that although an intention to make a gift could not be interpreted as an intention to declare a trust, this referred to express trusts and did not prevent the court from recognising that the shares were held on a constructive trust by the transferor for the transferees. So if the transferor had done everything they could to effect the transfer, they will hold the property on constructive trust for the trustee.

What is meant by 'everything necessary'?

- In [[Re Paradise Motor Co Ltd]], the transferor of shares was considered to have done all necessary to effect the transfer of shares even though he had not signed the transfer document, since this was considered a mere irregularity.
- In [[Re Fry]], the donor needed consent from the Treasury to transfer the shares. He had applied for this consent, but it had not been obtained. He had not done everything necessary, since the Treasury may have required more information from him.

So the preferable view is that it will always be the case that the settlor/ donor could have done more to effect the transfer of legal title, but it should be sufficient that they have done everything essential for them to do to effect the transfer and without which the transfer cannot take place.

So we have a constructive trust. But even at this point, legal title of the shares will only be transferred where the formalities for transfer are satisfied. **The settlor will not be able to withdraw from the transaction, since a constructive trust will have been automatically constituted.**

If the property that is intended to be transferred to the trustee or donee comprises shares, the fact that the shares are held on constructive trust by the settlor or donor has significant practical implications. For example, any distribution of dividends will be paid to the settlor/ donor, but since they derive from the shares held on trust, the dividends are also held on trust. The settlor/ donor will be required to exercise the voting rights attached to the shares for the benefit of the beneficiaries.

In [[Mascall v Mascall [1985] 50 P & CR 119]], a father intended to gift his house to his son. He handed the land certificate to the son and executed the transfer document. The son needed to submit the transfer for stamping and ask the Land Registry to register his title. But before this could be done, father and son fell out. The gift was effective in Equity.

### Unconscionability

The Re Rose principle has been extended to apply even where the settlor/ donor has not done everything necessary to effect a transfer of title, but where they have done enough to effect the transfer such that any attempt to deny the validity of the transfer would be considered unconscionable.

In [[Pennington v Waine [2002] EWCA Civ 227]], the donor told her nephew she wanted to give him 400 shares in a company and wanted him to become a director of the company, for which he needed to own at least one share. The donor died before the company auditor had delivered the form to the company. Technically, she had not done everything needed to transfer title of the shares. The auditor of the company was considered to be acting as her agent. Omissions of the agent were considered to be omissions of the principal; he had not done everything necessary to transfer the shares.

Held that the nephew had an equitable interest in the shares, since it would have been unconscionable for the donor to revoke the gift before her death. Arden LJ recognised that there was no comprehensive list of what factors would make it unconscionable for the donor to recall the gift and that the court should evaluate all relevant considerations. These include:

- That the donor intended to make an immediate gift and did so of her own free will
- had informed her nephew of the gift

her agent had told the nephew that he did not need to take any action to register the shares

the nephew had agreed to become director.

Preferable view: donor had made a representation to the nephew on which he had relied, albeit not to his detriment. So the test for unconscionability is a form of estoppel, but without needing to prove detriment. Proof of estoppel establishes that it is unconscionable for the donor to seek to revoke the gift. The trust in this case was constructive.

### Donatio Mortis Causa

When a donor purports to make a gift at a time when they expect to die, but title of the property has not passed whilst the donor is alive, title might pass following the donor's death. Where the property is a chose in action or land, the effect of the donor's death will be to vest title in the donor's personal representatives rather than the donee.

This functions by means of a constructive trust; once the donor has died, title to the relevant property will have passed to the donor's personal representative. Where the conditions for the doctrine are satisfied, Equity will require the personal representative to hold the property on trust for the donee.

### Strong V Bird

Where the donee of a promised gift obtains title in another capacity, this will be sufficient to perfect the gift. The rule has been applied beyond the context of perfecting gifts to executors and administrators.
