# Purpose trusts

## Introduction

Exceptions to the beneficiary principle are explored.

> ‘Every…trust must have a definite object. There must be somebody, in whose favour the Court can decree performance.’  
> Morice v Bishop of Durham (1804) 9 Ves 399 (Sir William Grant MR)

```ad-question
Is it possible to create a trust for a purpose rather than a beneficiary or class of beneficiaries?
```

There are two significant exceptions to the beneficiary principle:

- Charitable purpose trusts are recognised despite the absence of ascertainable beneficiaries because they are for the public benefit.
- Non-charitable purpose trusts have been recognised as valid in specific, exceptional cases. These are known as the ‘Endacott’ exceptions.

## Charitable Purpose Trusts

Charitable purpose trusts are not void for infringement of the beneficiary principle because there is a mechanism for their enforcement. They are enforceable by the Attorney-General, with practical responsibility for enforcement lying with the Charity Commission.

Charity is a status, not a legal form or structure. A charitable organisation can be established via various legal structures, of which a charitable purpose trust is one option.

For example, a charity could be established by way of a limited company. In practice, charities can take other forms.

### Benefits of Charitable Status

There are a number of key benefits to trusts having charitable status. These include:

- No requirement to comply with the beneficiary principle
- More flexible rules on [[certainty of objects]] (i.e., certainty of purpose)
- No limit on their duration (i.e., they can exist in perpetuity)
- A rule known as the cy-près doctrine which allows the trust property to be applied for other charitable purposes even if the specific trust fails
- Tax benefits: These are outside the scope of the module, but are a major practical advantage to having charitable status.

### Requirements for Charity Purpose Trusts

To have charitable status, a trust must:

1. Be for a charitable purpose
2. Satisfy a public benefit test
3. Be wholly and exclusively charitable

## Non-charitable Purpose Trusts

In order to be valid, the purpose of a non-charitable purpose trust must fall within a recognised exception to the beneficiary principle. These exceptions apply only when a trust is created in a will and were classified in the case of [[Re Endacott [1960] Ch 232]].

The trusts recognised in Re Endacott are anomalous exceptions to the beneficiary principle. Only very limited types of trust fall within this category, and it is a closed class which is narrowly construed. No further exceptions are likely to be recognised.

Unlike charitable purpose trusts, there is no recognised method of enforcement for non-charitable purpose trusts. They are therefore known as ‘trusts of imperfect obligation’.

### Perpetuity

In general terms, the law prevents people from tying up their assets on trust in perpetuity (indefinitely). This is for policy reasons – it prevents people with wealth locking their assets away on trust and therefore out of circulation in the wider economy. If they were able to lock assets away on trust in this way, they could effectively control their assets for many generations into the future from beyond the grave.

#### Rule Against Remoteness of Vesting

The statutory rule against remoteness of vesting applies to charitable trusts. Just as the property held on a private express trust must vest in beneficiaries within 125 years, property held on a charitable trust must vest in the charity within that period.

The practical difference between property vesting in beneficiaries and vesting in a charity is that a trust with beneficiaries will be extinguished when the capital is distributed to the beneficiaries. In contrast, capital which vests in charity trustees will continue to be held by the trustees and used for those purposes unless the property runs out. If the trust fund is well-managed, the property may never run out, so the trust will continue to subsist unless the purposes fail. This means that charitable purpose trusts can exist indefinitely.

#### Rule Against Inalienability

The perpetuity rule applicable to non-charitable purpose trusts is the common law rule against inalienability. This rule provides that assets cannot be tied up on trust for longer than the common law perpetuity period of a life in being plus 21 years (or just 21 years if no life in being is specified).

The common law rule is stricter than the statutory rule. There is no ‘wait and see’ rule. This means that it must be clear from the outset that the trust must end within the prescribed perpetuity period.

The common law rule does not apply to charitable purpose trusts. As we have already seen, trusts for charitable purposes can therefore exist indefinitely.

#### Certainty of Purpose

The rules in relation to certainty are much more flexible for charitable purpose trusts than for private trusts:

- It is sufficient that there is an intention to apply property for a charitable purpose.
- If there is uncertainty as to how this intention is to be carried out, the trustees can direct that the property be applied for such charitable purposes as they select.
- For charitable purpose trusts, the court will strive to resolve any uncertainty and hold the trust valid once it has established charitable intent.
- The Charity Commission or the court can provide a “scheme” to specify the charitable purposes the property should be applied to.

[[Re Astor's Settlement Trusts [1952] Ch 534]] is an example of a case where an attempted non-charitable purpose trust was found to be void in part because the intended purposes were too uncertain.

```ad-summary
- Trusts which have a purpose rather than a person as their object will be void for non-compliance with the beneficiary principle unless they fall within one of the recognised exceptions to that principle.
- The largest class of exceptions is charitable trusts, which are enforceable by the Charity Commission (using authority delegated by the Attorney General).
- Charitable trusts benefit from less strict rules on certainty of purpose and perpetuity.
- There is a narrow class of anomalous non-charitable purpose trusts known as the Endacott exceptions. These are valid trusts but do not have anyone to enforce them.
- The normal rules on [[certainty of objects]] apply to non-charitable purpose trusts. They are also subject to the common law perpetuity rules.
```

## Charitable Purposes

To have charitable status, a trust must:

- Be for a charitable purpose
- Satisfy a public benefit test
- Be wholly and exclusively charitable

### History of Charitable Purposes

There is an extensive body of case law on charitable purposes, much of which refers to the charitable purposes listed in the preamble to the Charitable Uses Act 1601. Although the law on charities was codified in the Charities Act 2006 and consolidated in the Charities Act 2011, the history of the case law is important because many modern cases will still be interpreted by reference to the cases predating the legislation.

For around 300 years, the case law on charitable purposes developed with reference to the preamble to the 1601 Act, with four traditional ‘heads of charity’ emerging:

- The relief of poverty
- The advancement of education
- The advancement of religion
- Other purposes beneficial to the community

These were subsequently recognised to be a ‘checklist’ only, with other purposes capable of being charitable as long as they fell within the spirit of the preamble.

### Statute

The law has now been codified, with [s 2 Charities Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/2) providing that a charitable purpose is a purpose which:

- falls within section 3(1); and
- is for the public benefit.

There are 12 specific heads of charity set out under section 3(1) as well as a wide additional head of charity which codifies the common law principle of recognising additional charitable purposes falling within the spirit of the law.

The remainder of this element considers the heads of charity set out in section 3(1).

### Heads of Charity

The 12 specific heads of charity are:

- The prevention or relief of poverty
- The advancement of education
- The advancement of religion
- The advancement of health or the saving of lives
- The advancement of citizenship or community development
- The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science
- The advancement of amateur sport
- The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity
- The advancement of environmental protection or improvement
- The relief of those in need because of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage
- The advancement of animal welfare
- The promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown or of the efficiency of the police, fire and rescue services or ambulance services

#### 1. Prevention or Relief of Poverty

There is no definition of “poverty” in the Charities Act 2011, and it is therefore interpreted using existing case law, from which some key principles can be derived:

- Poverty does not mean destitution
	- "There are degrees of poverty less acute than abject poverty or destitution, but poverty nonetheless" (Re Gardom)
- Poverty means “going short”
	- This idea from Re Coulthurst is now reflected in Charity Commission guidance which provides that "it is likely to be charitable to relieve the poverty or financial hardship of anyone who does not have the resources to provide themselves…with the normal things of like which most people take for granted”.
- Poverty is a relative concept
- It is judged against a person’s “status in life”.
	- Trusts for the following have been found to be charitable:
		- “distressed gentlefolk” ([[Re Young]])
		- “ladies of limited means” ([[Re Gardom]])
- The purpose must not benefit the rich:
	- Otherwise it will not be “wholly and exclusively charitable”
	- See [[Re Gwyon]] in which a trust for the provision of clothing to boys was void on the basis that it did not require the boys to be poor and so would benefit rich boys too.
- Poverty can be inferred:
	- For example, the provision of a soup kitchen was implicitly for the alleviation of poverty ([[Biscoe v Jackson]]).
	- In contrast, a trust to provides dwellings for the “working classes” was not charitable, as “working class” did not indicate poor persons (Re Sanders' WT).
- Poverty can be temporary:
	- The Charity Commission's decision to grant charitable status to the AITC Foundation which provided relief for those who suffered as a result of the collapse of investment companies noted that "someone suffering a temporary period of financial hardship due to a sudden change in circumstances might also be eligible for assistance".

#### 2. The Advancement of Education

Charity Commission guidance indicates that the advancement of education it is not confined to formal instruction in an educational institution and could include training, research or broader education in the development of individual capabilities, competencies, skills and understanding. Case law has confirmed that the following are charitable purposes:

- The support of learning, such as scholarships to support students ([[Re Gott]]) and funding of lectureships ([[AG v Margaret and Regius Professors in Cambridge]]).
- Ancillary organisations in educational institutions e.g., a students' union, provided it exists to further the educational purposes of the institution ([[London Hospital Medical College v IRC]]).
- The dissemination of knowledge, as in [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales v AG]] in which a trust for the publication of law reports was considered charitable as it assisted research into the law.

The case law on advancement of education is not entirely consistent on what constitutes education. Compare the following cases:

- [[Re Shaw]]
- [[Re Hopkins' Will Trust]]

Note, however, that both cases predate the statutory requirement to prove public benefit. It is unclear whether research of value to the researcher would be sufficient to satisfy the statutory public benefit test.

The Charity Commission guidance also recognises that a wide range of organisations class as charitable under this heading, including:

- museums, galleries, libraries, scientific institutes
- pre-schools, playgroups, summer schools and homework clubs
- organisations supporting the work of educational establishments such as parent-teacher associations, teacher training organisations or exam boards
- organisations providing life skills training such as the Duke of Edinburgh award schemes, Scouts and Guides

This list is not exhaustive. See the Charity Commission guidance on charitable purposes for further examples.

#### 3. The Advancement of Religion

[s 3(2)(a) Charities Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/3) provides that “religion” includes:

- a religion which involves belief in more than one god, and
- a religion which does not involve a belief in a god.

Charity Commission guidance consolidates further case law requirements describing a religious belief as follows:

- belief in a god (or gods) or goddess (or goddesses), or supreme being, or divine or transcendental being or entity or spiritual principle ("supreme being or entity") which is the object or focus of the religion
- a relationship between the believer and the supreme being or entity by showing worship of, reverence for or veneration of the supreme being or entity
- a degree of cogency, cohesion, seriousness and importance
- an identifiable positive, beneficial, moral or ethical framework.

Although the advancement of religion was a recognised head of charity before the enactment of the Charities Act 2011, the earlier case law now needs to be considered in light of the statutory definition and Charity Commission guidance, which provides that it should be considered “in the context of current social and economic circumstances”.

Under the common law, it was unclear whether groups which did not recognise a god could be charitable. A prominent example was Buddhism, which was recognised by Lord Denning in [[R_v Registrar General Ex p Segerdal]] as an exception to the general rule requiring belief in a god.

Following the Charities Act, it is clear that the charitable head of the advancement of religion includes religions which do not involve belief in a god.

In [[R v Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages]] the Supreme Court held that Scientology was a religion, noting that:

> "_unless there is some compelling reason for holding otherwise, religion should not be confined to religions which recognise a supreme deity. First and foremost, to do so would be a form of religious discrimination unacceptable in today's society".

As well as meeting the definition of “religion”, charitable trusts under this head must also positively “advance” the religion.

Advancement of religion has been defined as meaning "to promote it, to spread its message ever wider among mankind; to take some positive steps to sustain and increase religious belief" [[United Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of England v Holborn Borough Council]].

This can be achieved by way of religious services, pastoral or missionary work.

Trusts for the following purposes have also been found to fall within this head:

- Support of a religious order, such as a monastery or convent ([[Re Banfield]])
- Public masses celebrating the dead ([[Re Hetherington]])
- The repair of churchyards or burial grounds ([[Re Douglas]])

#### 4. The Advancement of Health / Saving of Lives

The advancement of health includes the prevention or relief of sickness, disease or human suffering, as well as the promotion of health.

The Charity Commission takes a broad view of advancing health including complementary, alternative or holistic methods as well as conventional methods, though to be charitable there must be sufficient evidence for the claimed benefits of the method used (see Charity Commission Operational Guidance (OG) 304).

The relief of the sick has long been considered charitable. It can include, for example, the provision of hospitals ([[Re Resch's Will Trust]]) or healthcare advice (British Pregnancy Advisory Service).

The saving of lives includes rescue services such as lifeboat associations, mountain rescue and cave rescue.

#### 5. Citizenship / Community Development

Section 3(2)(c) provides that this head includes:

- rural and urban regeneration
- the promotion of civic responsibility, volunteering, the voluntary sector or the effectiveness or efficiency of charities.

It covers a broad group of charitable purposes directed towards support for social and community infrastructure, which is focused on the community rather than the individual.

As always, the purpose must be wholly and exclusively charitable. This was demonstrated in [[IRC v Oldham Training and Enterprise Council]] where an organisation was held not to be a charity because, in addition to providing vocational training for the unemployed, it also promoted trade, commerce and enterprise and provided advice to new businesses.

#### 6. Arts, Culture, Heritage or Science

Charity Commission guidance provides that to be charitable the art needs to be of “merit”, the assessment of which may require expert evidence.

Compare the cases of [[Re Delius]] (in relation to promoting the music of the composer Delius) and [[Re Pinion]] (in relation to the settlor's art collection). The former was considered charitable, though the judge left open the question as to the consequence if the trust had related to a lesser composer. In contrast, the art collection in [[Re Pinion]] was described by the Court of Appeal as “junk” and the trust was not charitable. These cases were decided under the old law (i.e., on whether they could be considered educational) but it can be presumed that similar considerations would apply under the Act.

Monuments can be charitable under this head if they are of cultural or historical importance. Monuments to private individuals are therefore unlikely to be charitable (but may be recognised as a non-charitable purpose trust).

Charity Commission guidance provides that “heritage” might be regarded as part of a country's local or national history and traditions which are passed down through successive generations. It includes charities for the preservation of historic land and buildings, and might also include activities concerned with preserving or maintaining a tradition (where the benefit to the public in preserving it can be shown).

This means that the purposes of the trust which failed in [[Williams' Trustees v IRC]] might now be considered charitable under the Charities Act 2011.

In that case, the court rejected the argument that a trust to foster the study of the Welsh language, history, music, literature and art was charitable. (To satisfy the requirements of the Charities Act 2011, other changes would also be needed to the trust in that case i.e. the exclusion of other non-charitable purposes such as providing a meeting place for recreation and refreshment).

#### 7. The Advancement of Amateur Sport

[s 3(2)(d) Charities Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/3) defines "sport" as sports or games which promote health by involving physical or mental skill or exertion.

There is uncertainty as to the types of games and sports which might qualify, and the level of physical or mental exertion required to promote health. It clearly includes physical sports such as football and athletics but also includes chess due to the mental skill involved. Other games and activities will be more borderline.

Compare the Charity Commission decisions in Cambridgeshire Target Shooting Association and Hitchen Bridge Club:

- The Bridge Club was found to be charitable on the basis that it involves logical and lateral thinking skills, planning, memory, sequencing, initiation and other higher order functions.
- In contrast while the Commission accepted that it was necessary to be physically and mentally fit to succeed in target shooting it was not convinced that these health benefits were gained from the activity itself.

#### 8. The Advancement of Human Rights

s 3(1)(h) provides for the advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity.

In order to be charitable under this head, the purpose must not stray into political objectives such as seeking to procure changes to the law.

Charity Commission guidance includes in its examples of the sorts of purposes falling within this head:

- raising awareness of human rights issues, relieving the victims and securing the enforcement of human rights laws; and
- the promotion of restorative justice and other forms of conflict resolution or reconciliation.

#### 9. Environmental Protection

Section 3(1)(i) provides that this head includes both the protection and improvement of the environment.

Charity Commission guidance provides that the advancement of environmental protection and improvement includes preservation and conservation of the natural environment and the promotion of sustainable development.

Conservation of the environment includes the conservation of a particular animal, bird or other species of "wildlife" in general; a specific plant species, habitat or area of land, including areas of natural beauty and scientific interest; flora, fauna and the environment generally.

Charities may need to produce independent expert evidence to show that the particular species, land or habitat to be conserved is worthy of conservation.

#### 10. The Relief of Those in Need

This charitable purpose is for the relief of those in need because of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage. Section 3(2)(e) provides that this includes relief given by the provision of accommodation or care.

The relief of those in need is a separate head of charity from the relief of poverty. It is therefore clear that a person does not need to be poor to be in need. However, it is necessary to show that they have a specific need.

These issues are both demonstrated in [[Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust Housing Association v Attorney General]] in which accommodation was provided for the elderly without a poverty requirement. In fact the tenants could sell their leases and make a profit. The purpose was found to be charitable on the basis that the tenants had a need (for suitable / accessible accommodation) which the charity sought to relieve by providing suitable accommodation (e.g. with communal services and a warden).

#### The Advancement of Animal Welfare

Before the welfare of animals was added as a separate head of charity trusts for this purpose were upheld on the basis that they promoted human morality by discouraging cruelty to animals by humans.

The purpose of the advancement of animal welfare includes providing for the welfare of particular types of animal (e.g. cats and kittens in [[Re Moss]]) as well as animals generally. It has also included improving methods for slaughtering animals ([[Re Wedgewood]])

Trusts for the care of particular animals (e.g. the testator's pet dog) are not included, although such trusts might exceptionally be upheld as non-charitable purpose trusts.

The purpose of pursuing the abolition of vivisection has also been found not to be charitable since this would be a political purpose seeking a change in the law (as well as failing to meet the public benefit requirement) ([[National Anti-Vivisection Society v IRC]]).

#### 12. The Efficiency of Public Services

Section 3(1)(l) provides that this purpose relates to the efficiency of the armed forces, the police, fire and rescue services or ambulance services.

This head of charity traditionally related to the armed forces before it was extended by statute to also include e.g. the police and fire services.

Case law has upheld a fund for the promotion of physical fitness ([[Re Gray]]) and for the provision of a library ([[Re Good]]) in respect of an army regiment as charitable.

In addition to the existing case law Charity Commission guidance suggests a series of examples of purposes which would be considered charitable under this head including:

- increasing technical knowledge of members of the services through the provision of educational resources, competitions and prizes;
- providing opportunities for services personnel to gain additional experience relevant to their jobs.

#### General Purpose

There is also a wide, additional category in s 3(1)(m) which recognises that some charitable purposes may not have been captured within the previous 12 heads of charity.

This provision covers purposes which would have been recognised as charitable under the previous law, or purposes which are analogous to or within the spirit of the statutory heads of charity and earlier case law.

This principle of recognising charitable purposes by analogy is a long-standing principle of charity law. It ensures that the law on charitable purposes is flexible and can evolve to include additional purposes that were not specifically envisaged when the Act was drafted but nonetheless merit charitable status.

### Wholly and Exclusively Charitable

For a trust to have charitable status, its purposes must be wholly and exclusively charitable. In other words, all its purposes must be charitable.

If a trust has a mixture of charitable and non-charitable purposes, the consequences depend on the precise situation:

- As a basic rule, the trust will be void unless the non-charitable purpose falls within a recognised category of non-charitable purpose trusts. If the trust fails, the property will return to the settlor on a resulting trust.
- If the non-charitable purpose can be construed as ‘incidental or subsidiary’ to the main, charitable purpose, the trust will remain effective ([[Latimer v IRC]]).
- If the charitable and non-charitable purposes can be separated, and a portion of the fund allocated to each, the court will ‘sever’ the trust and recognise the charitable part. This will only be possible if the trust language contemplates severance of the fund ([[Salusbury v Denton]]). This requires the amount allocated to each purpose to be quantifiable ([[Re Coxen]]).

```ad-summary
- The law on charitable purposes has developed over hundreds of years, before codification in the Charities Act 2006 and consolidation in the Charities Act 2011.
- There are 12 specific heads of charity set out under section 3(1) Charities Act 2011, which expand the four traditional heads of charity recognised at common law.
- There is also a further head of charity in this section, allowing the recognition of further charitable purposes by reference to the previous case law and by analogy to recognised charitable purposes.
- The purposes of a charitable trust must be wholly and exclusively charitable, otherwise the trust may fail (unless it is a recognised non-charitable purpose trust, the non-charitable purposes are ancillary or it is possible to sever the fund and save the charitable component).
```

## Public Benefit

There is no definition of “public benefit” in the Act, but it does provide that:

- there is no presumption of public benefit ([s 4(2) Charities Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/4))
- Charity trustees must have regard to any guidance published by the Charity Commission in pursuance of its public benefit objective ([s 17(5) Charities Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/17)).

There are two elements to the public benefit requirement:

- whether there is an identifiable benefit; and
- what constitutes the public, or a section of the public.

```ad-statute
title: s 4 Charities Act 2011
(1) In this Act “the public benefit requirement” means the requirement in section 2(1)(b) that a purpose falling within section 3(1) must be for the public benefit if it is to be a charitable purpose.

(2) In determining whether the public benefit requirement is satisfied in relation to any purpose falling within section 3(1), it is not to be presumed that a purpose of a particular description is for the public benefit.

(3) In this Chapter any reference to the public benefit is a reference to the public benefit as that term is understood for the purposes of the law relating to charities in England and Wales.

(4) Subsection (3) is subject to subsection (2).
```

### Identifiable Benefit

The question of whether there is an identifiable benefit is a separate question from whether the trust is for a charitable purpose as a matter of law. It is a question of fact as to whether there is a benefit to the public having regard to all the evidence in the particular case. The settlor’s belief as to benefit is not relevant.

Benefit is balanced against any detriment or harm arising from the purpose. The benefit must be capable of being identified and described even if it cannot be quantified or measured. If it is not obvious that the purpose is beneficial, the Charity Commission may require evidence.

[[Re Hummeltenberg]]: A benefit could not be identified in relation to a training college for mediums notwithstanding the settlor’s belief that it was beneficial.

[[National Anti-Vivisection Society v IRC]]: The adverse effect on medical research outweighed the benefit arising to the welfare of animals of abolishing vivisection.

### Public or Section of the Public

The purpose must be beneficial to the public or section of the public, not to a private class of individuals. This is for policy reasons: a settlor should not benefit from the advantages of charitable status in respect of a trust which in fact benefits only e.g. the settlor’s family and friends.

To satisfy the test:

- the possible beneficiaries must not be negligible in number; and
- the quality which distinguishes them from other members of the community must be a quality which does not depend on their relationship to a particular individual ([[Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Co Ltd]]).

It is not simply a question of numbers. In Oppenheim a trust for the education of children of the employees of a company which employed over 100,000 staff was held not to be charitable on the basis that the beneficiaries were defined by reference to their personal relationship with the employer.

Charity Commission guidance provides that charities can choose to focus on certain beneficiaries provided that:

- they have proper reasons for doing so
- the poor are not excluded from benefit
- the people focused on are a sufficient section of the public for the charity’s purpose. What constitutes a section of the public is therefore related to the purpose of the charity.

In [[IRC v Baddeley Viscount Simonds]] gave an analogy: a bridge may be charitable and it does not matter how many people actually use it. But confine its use to a selected number of persons, however numerous or important, and it is not charitable.

Charities can charge for the services or facilities they offer. They can even make a profit provided this is reasonable and necessary to carry out the charity’s aims e.g. used to fund the facilities provided by a private school or hospital.

The opportunity to benefit must not be unreasonably restricted. For example if fees restrict the benefit to only those who can afford the fees it may be that the benefits are not available to a sufficiently large section of the public.

If charges are of a level which the poor cannot afford, the trustees must make sure that the poor can otherwise benefit. This is always a matter of degree and will be considered further in the context of the advancement of education.

The application of the public benefit requirement differs as between the different charitable purposes.

#### The Prevention or Relief of Poverty

The requirement that the class of beneficiaries must not be defined by reference to their relationship with a single person is relaxed in the case of the relief or prevention of poverty. However, the purpose must still be for the benefit of a particular description of poor persons, as opposed to the benefit of particular poor persons (which would be a private trust).

In [[Re Scarisbrick’s Will Trusts]] it was considered that trusts for “poor relations” are “of so altruistic a character” that the public element may be inferred, or they can otherwise be accepted as being a “hallowed, if illogical, exception”.

The benefit is easily established for a purpose to relieve poverty, and the relaxation of the “public” element means that trusts for such purposes can have pools of beneficiaries where there is a family or other personal connection to the settlor (such as to an employer in [[Dingle v Turner]]), or restricted to a smaller geographical area where this would not be allowed for other charitable purposes.

#### Advancement of Education

Fee paying schools have been an issue of particular difficulty in relation to the public benefit requirement. As noted above, charities can charge fees but must not by doing so exclude the poor for benefitting from the charitable purpose. Both elements of the public benefit requirement were considered in [[R. (on the application of Independent Schools Council) v Charity Commission for England and Wales [2012] Ch. 214]]:

| Element               | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identifiable benefit  | The benefit of providing education was not outweighed by the social mobility implications of the requirement to pay fees. |
| Section of the public | Although the accessibility of the benefit can be restricted by a requirement to pay fees, if fees are of a level which the poor cannot afford the trustees must make provision so that the poor can otherwise benefit. This benefit must be more than a de minimis or “token” benefit. However, once that hurdle is met it is for the trustees to determine how this requirement might be met in the particular circumstances. Examples suggested included the provision of scholarships or making teaching materials or other facilities (such as swimming pools or sports grounds) available.                                                                                                                          |

#### Advancement of Religion

Before the Charities Act 2006 there was a presumption that charitable trusts for the advancement of religion were for the public benefit. Now the presumption has been abolished the public benefit must be proven in each case.

#### Advancement of Human Rights

A key difficulty in relation to intended charitable trusts for the advancement of human rights is distinguishing between trusts with political objectives (which would not meet the public benefit requirement) and those which are pursuing a political activity as a means of achieving a charitable end (which can satisfy the requirement).

For example, a trust by Amnesty International has been held not to be charitable because its objectives included securing the release of prisoners of conscience and the abolition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. The court did not consider that it could judge whether procuring a change of law in a foreign country would be to the public benefit in the UK. (Other objectives of the trust were charitable, but the trust could not be charitable as it was not wholly and exclusively charitable).

## The Cy-près Doctrine

Where a private trust fails there is usually a resulting trust to the settlor.

Where a charitable purpose trust fails, however, a resulting trust would defeat the intention of the person who had dedicated their property to a charitable purpose.

Charitable trusts are therefore subject to the cy-près doctrine.

This provides that where a charitable purpose trust fails any surplus funds will be applied to another charitable purpose by way of a scheme established by the Charity Commission or court.

A person who donates property to a charitable purpose therefore knows that it will be used for charitable purposes, even if the particular purpose fails.

Under [s 62 Charities Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/62) there are five grounds on which the original purpose of a charitable gift can be altered:

1. The original purpose has been fulfilled or cannot be carried out.
2. The original purpose may still be workable but does not provide a use for all the property available to the trust i.e. there are surplus funds.
3. The property from similar trusts is combined so as to be used more effectively.
4. The original purpose referred to an area or class of persons which is no longer relevant or suitable.
5. The purpose has:
	- been adequately provided for by other means;
	- ceased to be charitable in law; or
	- ceased to provide a suitable and effective method of using the property.

Once property has been given to charity it is given for all time, so where there is a subsequent failure the gift cannot go back on a resulting trust – it will be applied cy-près.

However, where there is an initial failure i.e., property cannot be applied to the specific purpose from the beginning, it will only be applied cy-près if the settlor has shown a general charitable intention.

The question for the court to decide in construing the document is whether there was a specific intention to benefit a particular object, or an intention to give effect to a general mode of charity (notwithstanding a reference to a more specific object). Only in the latter case can the property be applied cy-près on the failure of the initial purpose.

```ad-summary
- Charitable trusts must satisfy the public benefit test set out in the Charities Act 2011.
- There is no presumption of public benefit and it is necessary to demonstrate that the trust satisfies this requirement.
- Trustees must consider Charity Commission guidance on the meaning of public benefit.
- The question of public benefit is separate to that of whether the purposes are charitable. It must be shown that the trust provides some ascertainable benefit.
- The purposes of a trust must be for the public or a section of the public. The trust must not be restricted to a private class of individuals.
- Charities may charge for their services but such fees must not act so as to restrict the poor from benefitting from the trust.
- If the purposes of a charitable trust fail, the cy-près doctrine applies, allowing the property to continue to be used for other charitable purposes.

## Non-charitable Purpose Trusts

In order to be valid the purpose of a non-charitable purpose trust must fall within a recognised exception to the beneficiary principle.

These exceptions apply only when a trust is created in a will and were classified in the case of [[Re Endacott [1960] Ch 232]]. They are:

- Trusts for the maintenance of particular animals
- Trusts for the erection and maintenance of monuments and graves
- Trusts for the saying of private masses

Note that there are a few further miscellaneous exceptions, the continuing validity of which is doubtful. The court also classified gifts to unincorporated associations as a further exception, but there is a separate body of case law dealing with such gifts. This module focuses only on the three exceptions recognised above.

### Maintenance of Particular Animals

- A trust for the welfare of animals generally would be charitable.
- However, a trust for the care of a particular animal would not be charitable, as it would not pass the public benefit test.
- Nonetheless, trusts for the maintenance of particular animals have been upheld as valid (provided they comply with certainty and perpetuity requirements).

### Monuments and Graves

- A trust for the purpose of constructing or maintaining a monument could be charitable if it is of cultural or historical importance.
- However, monuments and graves in respect of private individuals will not be charitable.
- Nonetheless, trusts for the erection and maintenance of monuments and graves have been upheld as valid (provided they comply with certainty and perpetuity requirements).

### Private Masses

- A trust for the purpose of conducting religious ceremonies may be charitable if it passes the public benefit test.
- However, a ceremony that takes place in private will not pass the public benefit test and will therefore not be charitable.
- Nonetheless, trusts for the saying of private masses have been upheld as valid (provided they comply with certainty and perpetuity requirements).

Following *Endacott*, it is apparent that the exceptions are anomalous and difficult to justify other than as "concessions to human weakness or sentiment". The intended purpose must fall squarely within a recognised exception to be valid. Unlike charitable purposes, the exceptions will not be extended by analogy.

Non-charitable purpose trusts falling within an Endacott exception are sometimes referred to as trusts of imperfect obligation because although the court recognises their validity (meaning they will not fail if included in a will) they are not enforceable.

As a practical point, it is therefore prudent to check that the appointed trustee is willing to carry out the terms of the trust. If they are, the court will make what is known as a ‘Pettingall’ order. This requires the trustee to give an undertaking to comply with the trust. If they do not, the testator’s residuary legatees (who would otherwise receive the property) can sue to enforce the undertaking and prevent a misapplication of the fund.

## Perpetuity

The rule against inalienability applies to non-charitable purpose trusts. This rule requires the trust to come to an end within the common law period of 21 years.

The perpetuity period can be extended by reference to a human life in being i.e. the 21 year period does not start to run until the person dies. The person does not need to be associated with the trust. Royal lives are often chosen as in the example below.

It must be certain at the time the trust is created that it will come to an end within the perpetuity period, otherwise the trust will be void. The "wait and see" rule does not apply.

```ad-example
"£5,000 to my trustees on trust to maintain my grave for a period not exceeding 21 years following the death of the last surviving descendant of Queen Elizabeth II who is alive at the date of my death."
```

It seems clear that animal lives cannot be used as lives in being. Lives means human lives. Although the case law is not absolutely consistent on this point, it is likely that a trust to maintain an animal for the rest of its life will be void because it cannot be said with certainty that the animal will definitely die (and the trust therefore come to an end) within the perpetuity period – even if this may be highly likely.

Similarly, although it could be argued that a trust for the purpose of constructing a monument is likely to end within 21 years (as the monument is likely to have been completed within that time) as this cannot be certain it is advisable to include an express perpetuity period.

The rule against inalienability is applied strictly. A drafter should therefore always include an express perpetuity clause limiting the duration of a non-charitable purpose trust to the perpetuity period to ensure its validity. 21-year perpetuity period starts to run when the trust comes into effect i.e. on the date of the testator's death.

Earlier case law has upheld more ambiguous references to perpetuity, but there is no guarantee these would be upheld today.

```ad-example
> "For so long as the trustees can legally do so."

In the past, provisions such as this have been interpreted as references to the 21 year perpetuity period and consequently upheld as valid.

However, this is not best drafting practice. It is advisable to include an express perpetuity period.
```

There is an academic debate as to whether non-charitable purpose trusts should be limited to these specific exceptions. You may wish to read more widely around this topic.

One argument is that any non-charitable purpose trust should be valid provided that there is a mechanism for its enforcement in the absence of a beneficiary.

A number of foreign jurisdictions allow non-charitable purpose trusts. These jurisdictions typically include enforcement mechanisms such as the appointment of a third party with standing to enforce the trust in Court.

Consider, though, whether a third party with no beneficial proprietary interest in the trust property is sufficient to satisfy the beneficiary principle.
