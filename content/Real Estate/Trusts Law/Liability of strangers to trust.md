# Liability of strangers to trust

## Accessory Liability

When a trustee misapplies trust property, the beneficiaries have a number of potential claims. One such claim is a personal claim against a person who dishonestly assisted or procured the breach of trust. This claim is a form of accessory liability and is generally described as **‘dishonest assistance’**. Dishonest assistance is a fault-based claim: a defendant is only liable if their assistance was dishonest.

Dishonest assistance claims are not limited to the misapplication of trust property. They also apply to breaches of [[fiduciary duties]] by a trustee. For example, a person who dishonestly bribes a trustee to invest in a particular (authorised) investment is liable as a dishonest assistant.

Nor are these claims limited to trusts: they apply to breaches of duty by other fiduciaries.

### Requirements

In [[Group Seven Ltd v Nasir [2019] EWCA Civ 614]], para 29, the [[Court of Appeal]] said that

> ‘In order to find a person liable for dishonest assistance of a breach of trust, it is necessary to establish that:  
> (a) there was a trust in existence at the material time;  
> (b) the trustee committed a breach of that trust;  
> (c) the defendant assisted the trustee to commit that breach of trust; and  
> (d) the defendant’s assistance was dishonest.’

The same principles apply to breaches of fiduciary duty.

### Assistance

The defendant must assist the trustee or fiduciary in connection with the breach. It is sufficient if the defendant assists the trustee or fiduciary to plan, commit, or cover up the breach.

The assistance must be more than minimal. And it must make the commission of the breach (or its concealment) easier than it would otherwise have been.

See, generally, [[Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Fielding [2005] EWHC 1638 (Ch)]] and Group Seven.

The defendant cannot avoid liability by proving that the trustee or fiduciary would have committed the breach even if the defendant had not assisted them. If the defendant assists, they are liable.

It is also sufficient if the defendant procures or instigates the breach of duty: [[Eaves v Hickson (1861) 30 Beav 136]].

### Dishonesty

A person who assists a trustee or fiduciary to commit a breach of duty is only liable if they act dishonestly.

In [[Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378]], Lord Nicholls said (at 389) that

> ‘Acting dishonestly, or with a lack of probity, which is synonymous, means simply not acting as an honest person would in the circumstances.’

This approach to dishonesty was endorsed and more fully elaborated by the [[Supreme Court]] in [[Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67]]. Lord Hughes JSC said (at para 74):

> When dishonesty is in question, the fact-finding tribunal must first ascertain (**subjectively**) the actual state of the individual’s knowledge or belief as to the facts. […] When once his actual state of mind as to knowledge or belief as to facts is established, the question whether his conduct was honest or dishonest is to be determined by the fact-finder by applying the (**objective**) standard of ordinary decent people.

In the context of civil proceedings, the judge is the ‘fact-finder’. The standard of ordinary, decent people is determined by the judge.

See also [[Starglade Properties Ltd v Nash [2010] EWCA Civ 1314]].

### Remedies

A dishonest assistant is liable for the loss occasioned by the breach which they assisted. The claimant is not required to show a direct link between the assistance and the loss. ‘What must be shown is that the conduct assisted the breach of trust and that but for the breach of trust the loss would not have occurred’: Group Seven.

A dishonest assistant is also potentially liable for profits they acquire by reason of their participation in the breach: [[Novoship (UK) Ltd v Mikhaylyuk [2014] EWCA Civ 908]]. But the claimant must demonstrate that their participation was the **‘real’ or ‘effective’ cause** of the profits. The simple ‘but for’ test is not appropriate.

Moreover, the claimant does not have an automatic right to the assistant’s profits. The court has a discretion to grant or withhold the remedy. The court withholds the remedy where it would be disproportionate in relation to the form and extent of the assistant’s wrongdoing.

## Recipient Liability

When a trustee misapplies trust property, the beneficiaries have a number of potential claims. One such claim is a personal claim against a recipient of the misapplied trust property or its traceable proceeds.

This claim is generally described as ‘knowing receipt’ or ‘unconscionable receipt.’ Unlike proprietary claims against third-parties, knowing receipt is a fault-based claim: a defendant is only liable if they had the requisite degree of knowledge.

Knowing receipt claims are not limited to trusts. They extend to other cases involving the misapplication of property by a fiduciary. For example, the misapplication of a company’s assets by its directors.

### Requirements

In [[El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings plc [1994] 2 All ER 685]] Hoffmann LJ identified the following requirements for a knowing receipt claim:

- A misapplication of trust property (or property held in another fiduciary capacity).
- Beneficial receipt by the defendant of the misapplied trust property or its traceable proceeds.
- Knowledge on the part of the defendant that the property they received was misapplied trust property or its traceable proceeds.

### Beneficial Receipt

In [[Trustor AB v Smallbone (No 2) [2001] 1 WLR 1177]], Morritt V-C said:

> The receipt by the defendant should be for his own benefit or in his own right in the sense of setting up a title of his own to the property so received.

Receipt in a ‘ministerial’ capacity is insufficient for knowing receipt. For example, receipt of property by an agent on behalf of a principal does not expose the agent to a knowing receipt claim (although it may expose the principal to such a claim). The agent does not receive the property in their own right: they receive and hold it for the principal.

Where money is paid to a bank to be credited to an account which is in credit, the bank does not receive the money beneficially: [[Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson [1990] Ch 265]]; [[Polly Peck International plc v Nadir (No 2) [1992] 4 All ER 769]].

The position is different if the account to be credited is overdrawn. In such cases, the bank does receive the money beneficially to the extent that the payment reduces or discharges the customer’s indebtedness to the bank: [[Uzinterimpex JSC v Standard Bank plc [2008] EWCA Civ 819]], paras 38-40.

### Fault Requirement

A recipient of misapplied trust property (or its traceable proceeds) is not subject to a personal claim unless they had the requisite knowledge. If they dispose of the property, or dissipate it before they acquire such knowledge, they do not incur any personal liability: [[Re Montagu’s Settlement Trusts [1987] Ch 264]].

However, as soon as the recipient acquires the requisite knowledge, they must restore the property to the trust. If, instead, they dispose of the property, or dissipate it, they will be subject to a personal claim for the loss occasioned to the trust or for their own profits.

Knowing receipt claims are not limited to cases where the recipient had the requisite knowledge on the date of receipt. They extend to cases where the recipient acquired that knowledge after receipt, but before they disposed of or dissipated the property.

The leading authority on the knowledge required for the purposes of a knowing receipt claim is [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele [2001] Ch 437]].

```ad-test
title: Akindele unconscionable test

In [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele [2001] Ch 437]] it was held that
1. dishonesty is not a requirement for a knowing receipt claim, and
2. The recipient’s state of knowledge must be such as to make it unconscionable for him to retain the benefit of the receipt.
```

In Akindele, Nourse LJ conceded (at 455) that the ‘unconscionable’ test would present ‘difficulties of application’ and this has proven to be true.

Confronted with a difficult, open-ended test, some judges have reverted to the familiar Baden scale of knowledge and have applied the Akindele test by reference to that scale:

```ad-test
title: The Baden scale

The Baden scale was articulated by Peter Gibson J in [[Baden v Société Générale pour Favoriser le Développement du Commerce et de L’Industrie en France SA [1993] 1 WLR 509]], para 250. It comprises five types of knowledge:
1. actual knowledge
2. wilfully shutting one’s eyes to the obvious
3. wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make
4. knowledge of circumstances which would indicate the facts to an honest and reasonable man
5. knowledge of circumstances which would put an honest and reasonable man on inquiry
```

### Applying the Baden Scale

In [[Armstrong DLW GmbH v Winnington Networks Ltd [2012] EWHC 10 (Ch)]], Stephen Morris QC explained how the Baden scale should be applied in a commercial context. He said:

> ‘the position, in a commercial context, can be summarised as follows:
>
> (1) Baden types (1) to (3) knowledge on the part of a defendant render receipt of trust property “unconscionable”. It is not necessary to show that the defendant realised that the transaction was “obviously” or “probably” in breach of trust or fraudulent; the possibility of impropriety or the claimant’s interest is sufficient.
>
> (2) Further Baden types (4) and (5) knowledge also render receipt “unconscionable” but only if, on the facts actually known to this defendant, a reasonable person would either have appreciated that the transfer was probably in breach of trust or would have made inquiries or sought advice which would have revealed the probability of the breach of trust.’

Morgan J was prepared to follow this approach in [[Group Seven Ltd v Nasir [2017] EWHC 2466 (Ch)]].
