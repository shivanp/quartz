# Concept of a trust

## Trust Concept

### Definition

A trust is an equitable duty relating to property.

| Component   | Function                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Trustee     | Person subject to the duty |
| Beneficiary | Person to whom the duty is owed.                           |

- The property to which the duty relates is called the **trust property**.
- The trustee is usually the **legal owner** of the trust property.
- The beneficiary has an equitable **proprietary** interest in that property
- The duty is **equitable** because it was created and developed by the Court of Chancery (the court which administered the equitable jurisdiction).
- The basic content of the duty is that the trustee must hold or apply the trust property for the benefit of the beneficiary.
- This description of a trust is not intended to be exhaustive. It is possible in limited circumstances to create a trust for a purpose rather than a person. It is also possible to hold equitable interests on trust.
- There is no single definition of a trust.

### Descriptions

> ‘Equitable obligations to deal with property in a particular way.’
>
> ‘A trust is an equitable obligation, binding a person (who is called a trustee) to deal with property over which he has control (which is called the trust property) for the benefit of persons….any one of whom may enforce the obligation.’
>
> ‘A person who accepts property expressly (or impliedly) on the basis that he is to hold it for the benefit of another.’
>
> ‘A person holding the legal title to property under an express or implied agreement to apply it, and the income arising from it, to the use and for the benefit of another person.’

### History

A canonical example in the 18th and 19th Centuries was the family trust. This enabled a person to make provision for successive generations of their family. A person would make a will giving property to trustees and instructing them how it should be applied. In a standard case, trustees were instructed to distribute income to the deceased’s spouse and (after the spouse’s death) to the deceased’s children and (after the children’s deaths) to distribute the capital to the deceased’s grandchildren.

### Land Trust

Ordinarily, trustees would be given legal title to the land by the deceased, and they would enjoy all the powers of legal ownership.

In the exercise of those powers, the trustees would create tenancies and receive rent from the tenants. The trustees would pay the rent (**income**) to the deceased’s spouse and then (after the spouse’s death) the deceased’s children. After the children’s deaths, the trustees would transfer the land (**capital**) to the deceased’s grandchildren. Then the trust would cease to exist.

### Attributes

Trusts have two key attributes:

1. A trust allows the separation of the powers of the legal owner (held by trustees) from the benefits resulting from the exercise of those powers (beneficiaries).
2. A trust can confer different types of rights on different beneficiaries at different times.

### Listed Securities

The market in listed securities is underpinned by the trust:

- Most listed securities are in a ‘dematerialised’ or ‘uncertificated’ form.
- This means that legal ownership of UK-listed securities requires registration in an electronic register called CREST.
- Securities are registered in the names of CREST members (usually banks or other financial institutions).
- The members are the legal owners of securities registered in their names, but they generally acquire and hold the securities for the benefit of their clients. In other words, they hold them on trust.

> [!example]
> 
> The CREST member is registered as the holder (legal owner) of 100,000 shares issued by Tesco plc. The CREST member acquired 50,000 of those shares on behalf of a broker. The broker acquired 10,000 of the 50,000 shares on behalf of a private investor.
> 
> The legal analysis of this scenario is:
> 
> - The CREST member holds 50,000 of the 100,000 shares on trust for the broker.
> - The broker holds its interest in 10,000 of the 50,000 shares on trust (known as a ‘sub-trust’) for the investor.
> 
> Let’s now consider the legal and equitable rights of each of the parties in respect of the private investor’s 10,000 shares.
> 
> - The CREST member is the **legal** owner of the shares but has no **beneficial** interest. Legal title is held on trust for the broker.
> - The broker has an **equitable** interest in the shares. Like the CREST member, it has no beneficial interest in the shares. The equitable interest is held on trust for the private investor.
> - The private investor has an **equitable** and **beneficial** interest in the shares.
> 
> Thus, there is a ‘waterfall or chain of equitable relationships’. (See [[SL Claimants v Tesco Plc [2019] EWHC 2858 (Ch)]] for a more detailed analysis.)

### Characteristics

A trust can be used to distribute a modest estate across successive generations of a family and is also the structural foundation of a multi-billion-pound securities market which is essential to the UK’s economic prosperity.

#### Trust Property

Property is an essential requirement for a trust.

In [[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council [1996] AC 669]], Lord Browne-Wilkinson said that it is a ‘fundamental’ proposition of trusts law that ‘there must be identifiable trust property.’ The proposition is ‘fundamental’ because a trust is an equitable duty relating **to property**.

The trust property is known as the **subject matter** of the trust.

The question of whether there is trust property can be contentious, as is demonstrated by the case of [[Mac-Jordan Construction Ltd v Brookmount Erostin Ltd (in receivership) [1992] BCLC 350]].

Almost every asset or right can be held on trust. As Lord Shaw noted in [[Lord Strathcona Steamship Co Ltd v Dominion Coal Company Ltd [1926] AC 108, 124]]:

> ‘The scope of the trusts recognised in equity is unlimited. There can be a trust of a chattel or of a chose in action, or of a right or obligation under an ordinary legal contract, just as much as a trust of land.’

A chose in action is a right: it is intangible. For example, £100 credited to a bank account is a chose in action (a debt). The account holder has a right to be paid £100 by the bank: the bank owes £100 to the account holder.

It is worth pausing to consider two of the items mentioned by Lord Shaw.

- A chattel is a tangible item (other than land). Cars, computers, books, jewellery and clothes are obvious examples.
- A company share is another example of a chose in action. The nature of a shareholder’s rights depends on the nature of their shares. The most common shareholder rights are rights to attend and vote at company meetings and to be paid dividends by the company.

#### Changes to Trust Property

A trust ceases to exist if, **without any fault on the part of the trustee**, the trust property is destroyed or consumed. In the absence of any trust property, there is nothing to which a trust can attach.

It is common for the trust property to change without any breach occurring. In many trusts, the trust property fluctuates.

> [!example]
> 
> For example, in a standard family trust, a principal function of the trustee is to maximise the financial return from the trust property. This involves the trustee periodically reviewing the trust property and deciding whether to retain it or to sell and invest the proceeds in other property. Selling the property does not destroy the trust. It simply changes the trust assets.

#### Trustee

A trustee owns the trust property and has all the rights and powers of legal ownership. But a trustee must exercise those rights and powers consistently with the basic trust duty (i.e., they must hold or apply the property for the benefit of the beneficiary). As we have already seen, if the trustee does not act in accordance with that duty, they will be personally liable for breach of trust.

The functions and duties of trustees are not unitary. They can and do vary. The function and duty of any specific trustee is determined by the nature of the trust they are administering. In some cases (for example, a family trust) the trustee has an enduring asset management/investment function and is subject to various duties corresponding to that function. In other cases (for example, a trust of intermediated securities) the trustee’s function may be no more extensive than complying with the beneficiary’s instructions in relation to the trust property. The role of trustee is a voluntary office and is typically unpaid, although professional trustees are entitled to remuneration.

#### Trustee Duties

The basic duty of a trustee is to hold or apply trust property for the benefit of the beneficiary. As Sir Joseph Napier said in [[South Australian Insurance Co v Randell (1869) LR 3 PC 101, 110]]:

> ‘An indelible incident of trust property is that a trustee can never make use of it for his own benefit.’ Thus, a person is not a trustee of property which they have the absolute right to use for their own benefit.

Note that a trustee can be **one of** the beneficiaries of a trust. They will still owe duties to the other beneficiaries, so cannot simply use the trust fund for their own benefit. This would be a breach of trust.

Money cannot just be used freely: [[Customs and Excise Commissioners v Richmond Theatre Management Ltd [1995] STC 257]].

Similarly, in [[Re Bond Worth Ltd [1980] Ch 228 CD]], the ability of a company to use fibres in its manufacturing process was inconsistent with the company holding the fibres on trust for the unpaid seller of them. Slade J stated (at 261) that [[South Australian Insurance Co v Randell (1869) LR 3 PC 101, 110]] and other cases were

> ‘Clear authority for the proposition that, where an alleged trustee has the right to mix tangible assets or moneys with his own other assets or moneys and to deal with them as he pleases, this is incompatible with the existence of a presently subsisting [trust] in regard to such particular assets or money.’

There may be a limited exception to this principle. In [[In re Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (in administration) [2009] EWHC 2545 (Ch)]], Briggs J held (at paras 60-63) that the ability of a broker to sell trust securities on its own account and for its own profit was not inconsistent with a trust– because, by the terms of its agreement with the client beneficiary, the broker was under a duty to replace any securities it sold with identical securities. Briggs J said (at para 63) that the broker’s ability to sell the trust securities ‘was not, viewed in essence as a right to swap,’ fatal to the trust.

#### Objects

A trust must have a beneficiary or be for a permitted purpose. The beneficiaries or purposes of trusts are known as the trust **objects**.

A purpose trust is a trust for the promotion or realisation of a purpose (in other words, a trust without a beneficiary). It is not possible to create a trust for any purpose. It is only possible to create a trust for a permitted purpose. Charitable purposes are the principal category of permitted [[purpose trusts]]. There is also a small (closed) category of non-charitable [[purpose trusts]]. [[Purpose trusts]] are not considered in any detail in this element.

Most trusts will have a beneficiary or beneficiaries. A beneficiary has rights correlative to the trustee’s duties and can enforce those duties. A beneficiary also has an equitable proprietary interest in the trust property. This is important for two principal reasons:

The beneficiary’s rights are enforceable against third parties. The beneficiary’s rights are protected against the insolvency of the trustee.

In [[Akers v Samba Financial Group [2017] UKSC 6]], Lord Sumption noted that a beneficiary’s interest in the trust property

> ‘possesses the essential hallmark of any given right _in rem_, namely that it is good against third parties into whose hands the property or its traceable proceeds may have come.’

Thus, if a trustee misapplies trust property (for example, by giving £100 to their spouse, who is not a beneficiary) the beneficiary can assert their interest in the money against the spouse and demand that it is restored to the trust. Moreover, if the spouse uses the money to buy a painting, the beneficiary can assert an interest in the painting (the ‘traceable proceeds’ of the money) and demand that the painting is added to the trust.

Thus, a beneficiary’s equitable proprietary interest is important because it can be enforced against third parties. However, unlike legal proprietary interests, it cannot be enforced against everyone.

More particularly, equitable proprietary interests cannot be enforced against a purchaser of a legal interest who does not have notice of the trust.

So, if in breach of trust, a trustee transfers legal title to trust property to a purchaser who is unaware that they are purchasing trust property, the transfer extinguishes the beneficiary’s equitable interest.

These principles are confirmed in both [[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council [1996] AC 669]] and [[Akers v Samba Financial Group [2017] UKSC 6]].

As a beneficiary has an equitable proprietary interest in trust property, the property does not form part of the trustee’s estate for the purposes of the bankruptcy and insolvency regimes. It therefore cannot be distributed to the trustee’s creditors. Thus, a beneficiary enjoys ‘priority’ over the unsecured creditors of the trustee in the event of the latter’s bankruptcy or insolvency.

> [!example]
> 
> X owes B, C, D and E £50,000 each. B, C, D, and E are unsecured creditors of X. £100,000 is credited to X’s bank account. X is made bankrupt. Assuming X has no other creditors or assets, the claims of B, C, D and E abate rateably. Each will receive £25,000.
> 
> Vary the example: X owes B, C and D £50,000 each. B, C and D are unsecured creditors of X. X is a trustee of £50,000 for E. £100,000 is credited to X’s bank account: £50,000 of it is trust money. X is made bankrupt.
> 
> The trust money (£50,000) is not part of X’s estate for the purposes of the bankruptcy and cannot be distributed to X’s creditors. It continues to be held on trust for E. Assuming X has no other creditors or assets, B, C and D’s claims abate rateably. Each will receive £16,667.
> 
> A comparison of E’s position in the examples demonstrates the importance of a beneficiary’s equitable proprietary interest in the event of the trustee’s bankruptcy or insolvency.

The beneficiary of a trust has an equitable proprietary interest in the trust property which can be enforced against everyone except a purchaser of a legal interest who does not have notice of the trust.

### Categorisation of Trusts

Trusts can be categorised in various ways, but they are most frequently categorised as express, resulting or constructive.

An express trust is one which is deliberately created. In other words, it is a trust which arises in response to a person’s intention to create it. The person who creates the trust is known as the ‘**settlor**’.

Unlike express trusts, resulting and constructive trusts arise by **operation of law**. In other words, they are **imposed** by the courts. You will also see these described as ‘**implied** **trusts**’. In this module, we prefer the term ‘trusts arising by operation of law’.

## Comparisons and Distinctions

Trusts are compared with:

- Contracts
- Debtor-creditor relationships
- Proprietary security interests, particularly charges
- Agency
- Bailment
- Companies
- Administration of estates
- Gifts

### Trusts Vs Contracts

At first glance, a trust might seem similar to a contract. Both involve the creation of obligations which, if not performed, can give rise to a personal liability (often to pay compensation). It is also important to note that it is possible to contract to create a trust, and this does happen regularly in practice. But a trust is fundamentally different to a contract, both in the way it is created and in the nature of the relationship between the parties.

A contract arises as a result of an agreement between its parties, each of whom owes obligations to the other. It is a creation of the common law.

Trusts are more complicated arrangements, which are the creation of equity. There is no requirement for an agreement between any of the parties (whether settlor and beneficiary, trustee and beneficiary or settlor and trustee). An express trust arises as a result of intention manifested by the settlor alone. And the only obligations that arise are from the trustee to the beneficiary. The trustee must be willing to act, but there is no requirement for an agreement in the contractual sense. If the appointed trustee is unwilling to perform the role, they can be replaced.

### Trusts Vs Debts

A debt is an obligation to pay a sum of money. The person who must pay is the ‘debtor.’ The person to be paid is the ‘creditor.’

A loan is the most common example of a transaction giving rise to a debt: the borrower (debtor) must repay the loan to the lender (creditor).

Unlike a trust (which is a duty relating to specific property) a debt does not relate to specific assets or funds. A debt is merely an obligation to pay a sum of money, and the debtor may use any of their available resources to effect the payment. Unlike a beneficiary, a creditor cannot compel the debtor to apply any specific asset or fund for their benefit.

The beneficiary of a trust has an equitable proprietary interest in the trust property. By contrast, a creditor has a mere personal right to payment. If the debtor is unable to pay, the creditor does not have recourse to any of the debtor’s assets to discharge the debt – and, thus, is significantly affected by the debtor’s bankruptcy or insolvency.

### Trusts Vs Charges

Proprietary security interests secure the performance of an obligation, usually the payment of a debt.

A charge is the most common security interest. The chargor (debtor) creates a charge over their property in favour of the chargee (creditor). If the chargor is unable to pay the debt, the chargee can compel a sale of the property and use the proceeds of the sale to discharge (or reduce) the debt.

Both a beneficiary and a chargee have a proprietary interest in (respectively) the trust property and the charged property. However, there are important distinctions:

- Unlike a trustee, a chargor can use charged property for their own benefit. For example, it is common to acquire residential land using a secured loan (i.e., a mortgage). This does not prevent the owner occupying the land as their home.
- Trust beneficiaries are entitled to the beneficial enjoyment of the entire trust property. A chargee’s interest is limited to the amount of the debt secured.

A defining characteristic of a charge (but not a trust) is a right of redemption, i.e., the chargor’s right to unencumber their charged property by paying the debt.

### Trusts Vs Agency

Agency is a relationship in which the agent has authority to create legal relations between the principal and third parties. An example of an agent is a person who sells goods on behalf of someone else. The agent enters into the sale contract and receives payment from the purchasers. They are required to account for the proceeds to their principal.

A feature which is common to agents and (some) trustees is that both are subject to fiduciary duties. The essential difference between agents and trustees is that, unlike an agent, a trustee cannot commit a beneficiary to a contract with a third party. A trustee acts as a principal in their transactions with third parties.

The relationship between agent and principal is ordinarily a debtor-creditor relationship. However, it is possible for an agent to become the trustee of money or property received on behalf of the principal. Whether a trust relationship has arisen must be determined on the facts of the individual case, by reference to the parties’ intentions, expressed or inferred.

### Trusts Vs Bailment

Bailment is the transfer of possession of chattels from one person to another. The transferor is the ‘bailor’ and the transferee is the ‘bailee’. So a person who leaves their clothes with a dry cleaner is a bailor and the dry cleaner is a bailee. There is a superficial similarity between a trust and bailment. However, there are significant distinctions between a trust and bailment:

Only tangible personal property (chattels) can form the subject of a bailment, whereas (with one or two exceptions) any asset or right can be held on trust. Bailment involves transfer of possession, but does not impact the bailor’s legal title to the property. In contrast, the transfer of assets to a trustee completely divests a settlor of their interest in the property. A bailor’s interest (generally) survives a misapplication of the bailed property to a third party because a bailee has a possessory right to the property but is not the legal owner. In contrast, a trustee can transfer legal ownership, meaning that a beneficiary’s interest will not survive a misapplication in favour of a purchaser without notice.

### Trusts Vs Companies

Another comparison which it is useful to draw is between trusts and companies. Both can be used as vehicles for holding property, and there are some similarities between the roles of trustee and director (both of which are fiduciary in nature).

One crucial difference is that, unlike a company, a trust does not have legal personality. This means that a trust cannot bring or defend a legal action in its own name. It is the trustees who, as legal owners of the trust property, must carry out these functions. And, when exercising their rights as legal owners, trustees must act in the best interests of their beneficiaries.

Unlike trust beneficiaries, shareholders of a company do not have a proprietary interest in the company’s assets. Their interest is in the company itself. Similarly, the obligations of the company directors are generally owed not to the shareholders but to the company.

### Trusts Vs Estate Administration

A personal representative is responsible for the administration of a deceased person’s estate. There are two types of personal representatives:

| Personal representative | Appointment           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Executors               | Appointed by deceased |
| Administrators          | Appointed by court    |

A personal representative must distribute the deceased’s estate in accordance with their will or the intestacy rules.

There is a striking similarity between a trust and the administration of a deceased person’s estate. In both cases, one person holds property for the benefit of others, but there are two key distinctions:

1. As a practical matter, the function of a personal representative is to administer and distribute the deceased’s estate as quickly as is practicable (ideally within a year). By contrast, express trusts are commonly created to endure for many years, meaning trustees often have enduring asset management functions.
2. Unlike the beneficiary of a trust, a person interested in a deceased person’s estate does not have an equitable proprietary interest in any of the estate assets. Instead, they have a personal right against the executor relating to the proper administration of the estate.

### Trusts Vs Gifts

Traditionally, trusts were used to make gratuitous dispositions of property, meaning that the beneficiary obtained their interest without providing any consideration. Typically the trustee’s role was also voluntary, with no contractual obligation to act and no right to remuneration. As we have already seen, modern uses for trusts often arise out of a contractual relationship. However, many trusts still involve purely gratuitous acts by the settlor. How, then, do these compare with outright gifts?

Although you may see a gratuitous transfer on trust described as a ‘gift on trust’ it is important to distinguish this from the more simple arrangement involving the donation of property from one person (the donor) to another (the donee). This is what we mean by an outright gift. The gift involves the absolute transfer of full legal ownership. The donor is the full legal owner of the property. When they transfer that property to the donee, that person becomes the full legal owner. There is no separate equitable interest in the property at any stage. This is different to the creation of a trust, where the settlor creates a new equitable interest for the beneficiary.
