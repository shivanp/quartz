# Fiduciary duties

## Introduction

> ‘It is an inflexible rule of a court of equity that a person in a fiduciary position….is not, unless expressly provided, entitled to make a profit; he is not allowed to put himself in a position where his interest and his duty conflict…..human nature being what it is, there is a danger of the person holding a fiduciary position being swayed by interest rather than duty, and thus prejudicing those whom he was bound to protect.’  
> Lord Herschell in [[Bray v Ford [1896] AC 44]]

## Duties of Trustees

Trustees have two main types of duty:

1. Trustee duties
	- A primary duty to comply with the terms of the trust (i.e., to distribute trust property only in accordance with those terms and a custodial duty over the property in the meantime).
	- Duties to exercise their functions as trustees in accordance with prescribed standards of care and skill, which are aimed at safeguarding the trust fund.
2. Fiduciary duties
	- A duty not to create conflict between their personal interests and their duties to the beneficiaries.
	- A duty not to make an unauthorised profit from their role as a trustee.

### Fiduciary Relationships

The trustee-beneficiary relationship is fiduciary in nature. The distinguishing feature of such relationships is that they involve one party owing a duty of single-minded loyalty to the other. There is no set list of fiduciary relationships. They arise in a range of situations, often where there is an imbalance in power within the relationship (e.g., a trustee has legal title to the trust property, and all the powers of legal owner, meaning the beneficiary is reliant on the trustee to act on their behalf). Core examples of other fiduciary relationships include:

- Solicitor-client
- Company director-company
- Agent-principal

See [[Al Nehayan v Kent [2018] EWHC 333 (Comm)]] for discussion on other types of fiduciary duty and when such a duty can be found.

## No Conflict

The purpose of the no conflict rule is to ensure that the fiduciary is thinking only of their principal. If the fiduciary is tempted to act in their own interests, they may not be doing the best for their principal.

### Self-dealing

Perhaps the best example of a conflict in the case of a trust relationship is the situation known as ‘self-dealing’ (a term coined in [[Tito v Waddell (No 2) [1977] Ch 106]]).

Self-dealing involves a trustee purchasing assets from the trust or selling assets to the trust. There is a clear conflict as a buyer will always be seeking the lowest price and a seller will always be seeking the highest price. **Therefore, a trustee who holds the legal title is prevented from selling to themselves and for the same reason is prevented from buying trust property (subject to anything in the trust instrument authorising such a transaction).** If the trustee does enter into an unauthorised self-dealing transaction, the transaction will be voidable, meaning the beneficiaries can seek to rescind it (i.e., unwind the sale).

The transaction will not be voidable where the fiduciary has obtained the consent of the court or the fully informed consent of the principal to the transaction. Since the principal will not have been a party to the transaction, clear evidence of consent will be needed before the court will conclude that the principal has consented.

### Incorporating Company

Could a trustee get around this rule by incorporating a company and then selling trust property to that company?

The answer to the question above is clearly ‘no’. There remains an obvious conflict of interest in a situation where the trustee uses a wholly owned company to transact with the trust. This transaction will be voidable in the same way as if the trustee had personally entered into the transaction.

What about a situation where a trustee buys from or sells to a company in which the trustee holds shares but is not the sole shareholder?

This situation is more nuanced and will require a more careful look at the facts to determine the substance of the transaction rather than its form. Broadly, the position is likely depend upon whether the trustee has a controlling shareholding in the company. If so, the transaction may still be treated as self-dealing and the beneficiaries could seek rescission.

If the trustee does not have control of the company, the transaction is unlikely to be treated as self-dealing, but it will still clearly involve a breach of the no-conflict rule (because the trustee has a personal interest in the company).

### Fair-dealing

There is another, related rule (also recognised in Tito v Waddell (No 2)) known as the ‘fair-dealing’ rule. In this case, the transaction does not involve the trustee buying or selling trust property. Instead, it involves the trustee directly transacting with the beneficiary to buy their beneficial interest under the trust.

The rules here are not as stringent as those involving self-dealing, because the beneficiary is personally involved in the transaction.

However, because the relationship is fiduciary in nature, and the trustee is likely to be in a stronger bargaining position, the trustee must be able to demonstrate that the transaction was conducted fairly.

As is the case with self-dealing, the transaction is voidable unless the trustee can demonstrate that they made full disclosure to the beneficiary, acted honestly and fairly and did not take advantage of their beneficiary.

### Conflict Between Principals

The no-conflict rule also extends to situations in which a fiduciary's duties to one principal conflicts with their duties to another principal. Again, this comes back to the core obligation of single-minded loyalty to a principal. It is not possible to act entirely in the interests of both principals where their interests conflict.

```ad-example
Suppose A is the trustee and wants to buy a house for occupation by their beneficiary, B. A is also an estate agent and has been instructed by C to sell their house. A thinks that this would be the perfect house for B.

There is a clear and direct conflict between A's duties to B and C. Their duty to C is to secure the highest possible price for the house. But their duty to B is to pay the lowest possible price.
```

### Consent and Consequences

If there is a breach, the consequences depend on the nature of the breach:

- If the breach causes a loss to the principal, they can sue the fiduciary personally for breach of fiduciary duty. The fiduciary would be liable to compensate the principal.
- As we have already seen, breach of the self-dealing rule and fair-dealing rules result in the transaction being voidable. The beneficiaries may seek rescission.
- If the breach results in a profit to the principal, they may not require a remedy, although they may wish to end the fiduciary relationship. If it also results in a profit to the fiduciary, the principal can recover the profit from the fiduciary.

```ad-example
A trust has two trustees, A and B. The beneficiaries are minors. The trustees require legal advice on a tax issue which has arisen in relation to the trust. A is a partner at a law firm so B suggests that there is no need to obtain advice. A specialises in real estate and is not confident in providing tax advice so suggests instructing a tax partner at their firm.

The trustees should obtain advice from a different firm because A has a personal interest in this firm so it would be a breach of fiduciary duty to instruct them. Instructing another partner at A’s firm would involve a conflict between A’s duties to the beneficiaries and A’s personal interest in the firm.
```

## No Profit Rule

There are a number of broad ways in which a fiduciary might breach the no-profit rule:

- Directly using the property of their principal to make a personal profit.
- Indirectly profiting from their role as a fiduciary.
- Exploiting an opportunity which has come to them as a result of their fiduciary position.
- Receiving a bribe or secret commission to influence the way in which they perform their role as fiduciary.

### Direct Profit

Direct profit is made from holding/ investing funds on the behalf of clients. See [[Brown v IRC [1965] AC 244]].

N.B. There are specific rules set out in the Solicitors’ Code of Conduct which deal with what solicitors must do when holding client money.

### Indirect Profit

A fiduciary must also avoid making an unauthorised personal profit which arises from the performance of their role. A good example is the situation where a trust holds shares in a company and, in order to better monitor that company, a trustee is appointed as a director.

In such cases, the directorship may come with an entitlement to remuneration. Because the trustee takes on the director role in their capacity as trustee, they receive the remuneration in this capacity too and must therefore pay it into the trust fund instead of accepting it personally ([[Re Macadam [1946] Ch 73]]).

Note that this rule will only apply where the trustee has obtained the director position as a result of being a trustee. It does not apply if they are independently appointed as director (e.g. if they became a director before taking on the trustee role or if they could have been appointed as director even without the votes attached to the company shares).

The rule is also subject to anything in the trust instrument which allows the trustee to retain the remuneration ([[Re Llewellin’s Will Trusts [1949] Ch 225]]). Alternatively, the trustee could seek the fully informed consent of all the beneficiaries.

### Exploiting Opportunities

A fiduciary is not entitled to keep a profit that they made as a result of an opportunity that comes to them in the course of performing their fiduciary duties. This rule is very strict, as demonstrated by the seminal case of [[Keech v Sandford (1726) Sel Cas 61]].

```ad-note
Although the rule in _Keech v Sandford_ may seem harsh on the trustee, it comes back to the core obligation of the fiduciary to put their principal first. You may argue that the trustee tried to do this in _Keech_. They attempted to negotiate the lease for the beneficiary before doing so on their own behalf. But can you ever be sure that a trustee in such circumstances will absolutely exhaust all avenues of negotiation on behalf of the beneficiary if there remains a possibility that they could profit personally if those negotiations are unsuccessful? The only way to ensure that the trustee does everything in their power for their beneficiary is to absolutely prohibit them acting in their own interest.
```

Another case which demonstrates the strictness of the no-profit rule is [[Boardman v Phipps [1967] 2 A.C. 46]].

### Bribes and Secret Commissions

Perhaps the most egregious form of breach of fiduciary duty is the case where a fiduciary accepts money from a third party in return for performing their fiduciary role in a particular way. It is clearly contrary to public policy for a fiduciary to be susceptible to bribes, and the clear consequence is for the profit to be stripped from them ([[Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid [1994] 1 AC 324]]). It is also worth noting that such actions are likely to constitute an offence under the [Bribery Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/23/contents).

This principle has been extended to cases where a fiduciary receives a secret commission in the course of carrying out their role( [[FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC [2014] UKSC 45]]). The case is particularly significant because it settles the position as to the remedy available for breach of the no-profit rule.

### Claims for Breach of No-profit Rule

Breach of the no-profit rule will result in the fiduciary being stripped of their profits. Although earlier case law indicated that the available claim would depend on the nature of the breach, it is now clear from [[FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC [2014] UKSC 45]] that a beneficiary may elect between the following remedies in all cases involving breach of the no-profit rule:

| Remedy             | Details                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account of profits | This is a personal claim which requires the trustee to pay the principal an amount equivalent to the profit they have made. |
| Constructive trust | A principal may wish to argue that the profit made by the fiduciary is held on constructive trust for the principal. There are two primary reasons why the principal may want a proprietary claim: (1) A constructive trust provides protection against the insolvency of the fiduciary. The principal is able to identify an asset over which they have rights which rank above other creditors. (2) A constructive trust also allows the principal to trace into any subsequent profits made by the fiduciary ([[Attorney General for Hong Kong v Reid [1994] 1 AC 324]]).                                                                                                                            |
