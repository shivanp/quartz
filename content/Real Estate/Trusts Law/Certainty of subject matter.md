# Certainty of subject matter

## Introduction

```ad-quote
‘it is impossible to have a title to [property], when nobody knows to which [property] the title relates.’

Lord Mustill, [[Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd (in receivership) [1995] 1 AC 74]]
```

Certainty of subject matter comprises two requirements:

| Trust property requirement                          | [[Beneficial entitlement]] requirement |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| It must be possible to identify the trust property. | It must be possible to ascertain the beneficiary’s interest in the trust property.                                   |

## Trust Property Requirement

A trust is characterised by two principal features; a duty and a property right.

The duty to hold property for beneficiaries or to apply it for their benefit is meaningless unless it is possible to identify the property to which it relates. Similarly, the assertion of an equitable property right is futile unless it is possible to identify the property against which the right is being asserted.

In cases where a trust is created by transferring assets to a trustee, the trust property can be easily identified: it is the assets which are transferred.

In other cases, the trust property requirement can be problematic. Problems have been commonly encountered in two situations:

- A person attempts to identify the trust property by description.
- A person attempts to create a trust of a specific number of items from a larger quantity of similar items without identifying those to be held on trust.

### Identifying Subject Matter by Description

In cases where the trust property is identified by description, the trust will fail for uncertainty if it is not possible to ascertain the trust property from the description.

For example, a person cannot create a testamentary trust of the ‘bulk’ of their residuary estate because, although the residuary estate can be ascertained, it is not possible to ascertain how much of it constitutes the ‘bulk’: [[Palmer v Simmonds (1854) 2 Drewry 221]].

And a company cannot create a trust of its ‘net assets’ because ‘net assets’ does not describe any specific property of the company: [[Wilkinson v North [2018] EWCA Civ 161]]. Rather, the ‘net assets’ of a company is an abstract monetary sum representing the difference between the value of its assets and its liabilities.

### Identifying Subject Matter Out of a Larger Mass

An issue which has resulted in a large body of case law is the question of whether it is possible to create a trust over some items from a larger quantity of similar (or identical) items without identifying the specific items which are to be held on trust.

#### Fractional Interests

There is no problem with creating a trust over a fractional interest of a wider mass, regardless of the nature of the property.

```ad-example
20% of a settlor's 100 ordinary shares in a company are held on trust for a beneficiary. The 100 shares are the trust property, and the beneficiary has a 20% interest in each. 
```

```ad-example
20% of a settlor's five one-carat diamonds are held on trust for a beneficiary. The five diamonds are the trust property, and the beneficiary has a 20% share in each. 
```

#### Specific Number of Items

The difficulty arises when a settlor purports to declare a trust over a specified number of items from a larger mass.

```ad-example
Consider the following being held on trust:
1. 20 of the settlor’s 100 ordinary shares in a company
2. One of the settlor’s five one-carat diamonds
```

If the beneficiary is only intended to have a specified number of items from a larger mass, it is important to know which are held on trust for them, and which are not (for instance, suppose 4 of the diamonds are stolen, or some of the shares are sold by the trustee at a profit and others at a loss).

### Categorising Assets

It is possible to declare a trust of 20 out of 100 ordinary shares in the same company without identifying the specific shares. In contrast, it is not possible to declare a trust over one out of four diamonds without identifying the specific diamond to which the trust relates.

#### Tangible and Intangible

Tangible assets are physical assets, such as gold or cash.

Intangible assets do not exist in physical form, like shares in a company, intellectual property rights and debts.

#### Fungible and Non-fungible

Assets are described as “fungible” if they are identical and readily exchangeable, like the ordinary shares in our examples. Although the price of the shares may fluctuate over time, at any given time they will all be worth the same and therefore interchangeable.

The diamonds in our examples are non-fungible. Although they have similarities, they may be distinguishable in cut, colour and clarity. Crucially, they may well not have the same value and are therefore not interchangeable.

The trust over the shares in our example is valid because the shares are **intangible and fungible**.

There is no need to identify the specific shares which are subject to the trust. They are completely interchangeable.

```ad-tip
Why is there no problem with certainty of subject matter here? What if the trustee sold some of the shares?

Equity has developed a series of very principled “tracing” rules which apply to determine which assets are trust assets in such a scenario.
```

The trust over the diamond in our example is void for uncertainty of subject matter because the diamonds are **tangible and non-fungible**. They are not interchangeable, and it is necessary to identify the specific diamond which is the subject matter of the trust.

Similarly, **fungible and tangible** assets cannot be declared a trust without specifying individual items.

```ad-warning
It is not possible to declare a trust over a specified number of **tangible** assets forming part of a bulk, even if they appear to be identical, without identifying them. So only intangible fungible works.
```

Examples of this include:

- 20 out of 100 bottles of wine (all of the same vintage)
- One out of five 1 kg bars of gold

## Beneficial Entitlement Requirement

It must also be possible to ascertain the nature and extent of the beneficiary’s interest in that trust property.

To the extent that it is not possible to do so, the trust will fail.

```ad-example
Consider a trust under which the trustees are to hold two cars on trust for A and B, with a power to C to determine which car should be held for A and which for B.

There is initially no problem with this trust because there is a mechanism for determining [[beneficial entitlement]].

However, if C dies before making the selection, the trust will fail because it is no longer possible to ascertain which beneficiary is entitled to which car. A similar trust failed in [[Boyce v Boyce (1849) 16 Sim 476]] for this reason.
```

This example highlights the importance of good drafting when declaring a trust. The real problem in this scenario is the failure of the settlor to consider the possibility that C might not be able to exercise the power. The settlor could have avoided this problem by making clear what should happen to the property if C couldn’t or wouldn’t exercise the power. One solution might have been to give the trustees a default power to make the decision.

The example also highlights an important legal point, being that a trust can fail for certainty either when it is initially declared or, as in this case, subsequently.

### Objective Assessment

Although not free from criticism, the legal principles discussed above are generally quite clear. There is, however, one more controversial case on [[beneficial entitlement]] which is rather harder to apply in practice.

Consider the scenario in which trustees hold a sum on money on trust, out of which they are directed to pay a ‘reasonable income’ to a beneficiary.

Based on the principles we have discussed so far, you would be forgiven for concluding that this trust would be void for uncertainty of subject matter.

The case of [[Re Golay’s Will Trusts [1965] 1 WLR 969]] indicates that this trust would be valid on the basis that ‘reasonable income’ is an ‘objective yardstick’.

The practical question of what constitutes a ‘reasonable income’ is more difficult and will likely turn on very specific facts.

## Summary

Certainty of subject matter is a requirement for the creation of an express trust. The requirement has two limbs:

1. It must be possible to identify the trust property (‘the trust property requirement’)
2. It must be possible to ascertain the beneficiary’s interest in the trust property (‘the beneficial interest requirement’)

The trust property requirement causes particular problems when it comes to declaring trusts over a specified number of assets from a wider bulk of similar assets. The following core principles are established by the case law discussed below:

- It is not possible to declare a trust over a specified number of tangible assets forming part of a wider bulk, whether or not they are fungible, unless the specific assets forming the subject matter of the trust are identified.
	- [[ In re London Wine Company (Shippers) Ltd, 1986 PCC 121 (decided in 1975)]]
- It **is** possible to declare a trust over a specified number of intangible, fungible asset forming part of a wider bulk without identifying the specific assets subject to the trust.
	- [[Hunter v Moss [1993] 1 WLR 934]]

Hunter has been applied in subsequent cases, e.g., [[Re Harvard Securities Ltd (In liquidation) [1997] 2 BCLC 369]], but it is not particularly satisfactory when compared with the case law on tangible property. It establishes that a person can create a trust of 20 of their 100 ordinary shares in a company without identifying the 20 shares to be held on trust, even though it is impossible to identify the shares which are held on that trust. Although the tracing rule could be used to resolve this problem, it does raise the question of why shares ought to be treated any differently to tangible fungibles such as gold bullion, where the same tracing rules could be applied. Why shouldn’t it be possible to create a trust of 20 out of 100 identical gold bars?

More recent case law appears to reconceptualise the decision in Hunter. In Lehman Brothers, at para 232, Briggs J acknowledged that the difficulty of applying Hunter

> ‘Lies in the absence of any clearly expressed rationale as to how such a trust works in practice’.

He continued:

> The analysis which I have found the most persuasive is that such a trust works by creating a beneficial co-ownership share in the identified fund, rather than in the conceptually much more difficult notion of seeking to identify a particular part of that fund which the beneficiary owns outright.

Briggs J’s approach in Lehman Brothers is a clear reconceptualisation of Hunter. Its effect can be illustrated by the example of a person creating a trust of 20 of their 100 ordinary shares in a company without identifying the 20 shares to be held on trust.

According to Hunter, the trust takes effect as a trust of 20 specific shares, with the remaining 80 shares unaffected. However, on Briggs J’s approach, the trust takes effect as a trust of all the shares, with the beneficiary having a 1/5 interest in every one of them. In other words, Briggs J’s approach changes an intention to create a trust of a specific number of shares from a larger quantity of similar shares into an intention to create a trust of a fractional interest in all the shares.

Generally, the courts refuse to change a person’s intention in this (or any other) manner: London Wine, at 137-138; Goldcorp, at 91. However, Briggs J may have been influenced by the fact that a share is simply a fractional interest in a company’s capital, such that transactions involving shares are necessarily transactions involving fractional interests.
