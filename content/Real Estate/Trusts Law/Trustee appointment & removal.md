# Trustee appointment & removal

## Introduction

It is a fundamental requirement of a trust that it must have a trustee. In the case of express trusts, the trustee(s) will usually be appointed by the settlor when the trust is first established.

However, this does not necessarily mean that the trustee will remain the same while the trust is in operation. The trustees of a trust can, and often do, change over time.

The rules relating to appointment, removal and retirement of trustees are explored.

## Selecting Trustees

In general, any person except a minor may be a trustee: [s 20 LPA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/20). There are, however, practical restrictions to consider such as whether the appointment gives rise to any conflicts of interest.

There are no rules prescribing a minimum or maximum number of trustees, but there is an exception for trusts of land, because legal title to land may only be held by a maximum of four persons. It is also necessary for such trusts to have a minimum of two trustees, in order to give good receipt.

It is good practice to appoint more than one trustee but, as trustees must generally act unanimously, it is preferable to keep numbers relatively low to avoid administrative difficulties.

The trust instrument may contain further rules about the required number of trustees, as well as restrictions on who may act as trustee.

## Appointment of Original Trustees

### Lifetime

Trustees are usually appointed by the settlor when they establish a trust. In the case of an *inter vivos* (lifetime) trust, the settlor has two broad choices:

- A self-declaration of trust
- A transfer on trust.

With a self-declaration of trust, the settlor will become trustee as long as all the key requirements for declaration of an enforceable trust are met.

In the case of a transfer on trust, the trust is constituted once the settlor transfers legal title to the trustee. As trusteeship is a voluntary office, the trustee can decline the role. The settlor should therefore only transfer legal title to the intended trustee once they have confirmed that the trustee is willing to act.

### Wills

It is helpful to appreciate how testamentary trusts take effect:

- The testator names their executors in their will. If the executors are able and willing to act, they will take legal title to the testator’s entire estate.
- The executors then administer the estate. Once they have paid any liabilities of the testator, they must distribute the property in accordance with the will. This includes ensuring that legal title is vested in the intended trustees of any trusts.
- Sometimes the same people will be named as executors and trustees. In such cases, the executors will now hold the legal title to the trust property in their capacity as trustees instead of as executors.
- If the testator has named someone different as trustee, the executors must transfer the property to them.

But what if the named trustee is unwilling or unable to act? Although the testator may have named their intended trustees, we have already seen that trusteeship is a voluntary office and the named trustees may decline the role. It may also be impossible for the named trustees to act. The most obvious example is the situation where the trustees predecease the testator.

In such cases, the trust will not fail. Instead, it will be necessary to appoint alternative trustees. The executors will hold the property on trust until the new trustees are appointed. But who appoints the trustee in such cases?

### Appointment of Trustees

As we have already seen, the trustees of a trust may need to change over time. Once the settlor has created the trust, their involvement ceases, and they do not automatically have the right to name replacement trustees (and in the case of testamentary trusts this would of course be impossible). Instead, replacement trustees may be appointed in one of the following ways:

- Using any express powers to appoint trustees found in the trust instrument.
- Using statutory powers to appoint trustees.
- By the beneficiaries exercising their [[Saunders v Vautier (1841) 4 Beav 115]] rights.
- In the case of charitable trusts, by the Charity Commission.
- By the court.

A trust instrument may contain powers to appoint new trustees. Sometimes a settlor will reserve such a power for themselves, giving them a degree of continued control over the trust.

There is also a general statutory power to appoint new trustees in [s 36 Trustee Act 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/36) (‘TA 1925’). The general statutory power can be exercised in the following cases:

- On the death of a trustee
- If a trustee is abroad for over a year
- If an appointed trustee is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity to act
- If a trustee wishes to retire, refuses to act or is unfit to act

This power may be exercised by the persons nominated in the trust instrument to appoint trustees or, if there are no such persons, by the surviving or continuing trustees. If all the trustees have died, the power is exercisable by the personal representatives of the last to die ([s18(2) TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/18)).

```ad-statute
title: s 36(6) TA 1925
Where, in the case of any trust, there are not more than three trustees—]
- (a) the person or persons nominated for the purpose of appointing new trustees by the instrument, if any, creating the trust; or
- (b) if there is no such person, or no such person able and willing to act, then the trustee or trustees for the time being;

may, by writing, appoint another person or other persons to be an additional trustee or additional trustees, but it shall not be obligatory to appoint any additional trustee, unless the instrument, if any, creating the trust, or any statutory enactment provides to the contrary, nor shall the number of trustees be increased beyond four by virtue of any such appointment
```

### Saunders V Vautier Rights

If the beneficiaries of a trust agree, they can exercise their Saunders v Vautier rights to change the trustees of the trust.

Traditionally, Saunders v Vautier only gives the beneficiaries the power to collapse the trust. Therefore, if they wanted to change the trustees, the beneficiaries would need to exercise their Saunders v Vautier rights to collapse the trust and then declare a new trust with new trustees. This is not ideal from an administrative perspective and may have tax consequences.

There is therefore now also a statutory power in [s 19 Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/47/section/19) (‘TLATA’) which gives beneficiaries with Saunders v Vautier rights the power to direct the trustees to appoint a new trustee.

This power must be exercised in writing and **cannot be exercised in cases where the trust instrument contains an express power to appoint trustees**.

### Court Powers

It is a core principle that [[equity]] will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee.

For this reason, if a trust would be without a trustee because there is nobody authorised who is able and willing to make the appointment, the court can make the appointment instead. The court’s power to do this is found in [s 41(1) TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/41).

The power in s 41 is extended to the Charity Commission in the case of charitable trusts: [s 69(1)(b) Charities Act 2011](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/25/section/69).

When exercising its statutory power, the court will consider the following principles:

- The court should consider the wishes of the settlor or testator (if such wishes are expressed or evidenced in the trust instrument)
- The court should not appoint a trustee where there is a dispute between the beneficiaries as to whether that person would be appropriate.
- The court should consider whether the appointment will promote or impede the trust administration. This means the court should take into account the views of the existing trustees, but must consider whether those views are reasonable.

### Removal of Trustees

Similar rules apply to the removal of trustees as to their appointment:

- The trust instrument may contain rules dealing with removal of trustees.
- The general statutory power to appoint trustees also effectively extends to removing trustees in the circumstances where it is considered necessary to replace them.
- The court also has both statutory and common law powers to remove trustees.
- The Charity Commission also has the power to remove charity trustees.

Just as a trust instrument may contain powers to appoint trustees, it may also provide for powers to remove trustees.

Again, a settlor may choose to reserve such a power to ensure a degree of continuing control over the trust.

As we have already seen, the general statutory power in [s 36 TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/36) provides for the replacement of trustees in recognised circumstances. The effect of this section is to give the person with the power to appoint trustees the ability to remove a trustee and appoint a new trustee in their place.

The court’s statutory power to appoint trustees under s 41 TA 1925 also extends to the removal of trustees. In particular, this section envisages the court exercising a power to replace trustees in cases where the trustee is bankrupt, lacks capacity or is a company which is in [[liquidation]] or has been dissolved.

The same power is exercisable by the Charity Commission where the trust is charitable.

Separately, the court also has an inherent jurisdiction to remove trustees in cases where it is concluded that it is not appropriate for the trustee to remain in office (e.g., where they act dishonestly).

## Retirement of Trustees

### Voluntary Retirement

A trustee can voluntarily retire by deed where there are at least two people or one trust corporation to act as trustees and the co-trustees and any person with a power to appoint trustees consents: [s 39(1) TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/39).

Trustees who retire must also comply with the statutory requirements, or they will remain in office. A trustee who retires from the trust should obtain a formal discharge of liability from the beneficiaries.

### By Direction of the Beneficiaries

In addition to having a power under s 19 TLATA to appoint trustees, beneficiaries with Saunders v Vautier rights also have the power to compel a trustee to retire from the trust. The direction must be made in writing and requires the agreement of all beneficiaries.

As with voluntary retirement, the power can only be exercised if, after the retirement of the trustee, there will remain at least two trustees or one trust corporation.
