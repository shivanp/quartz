# Trustee powers and duties

## Powers Vs Duties

In order to understand the role of trustee, it is necessary to distinguish trustee powers from trustee duties.

| Trustee powers                                                                                      | Trustee duties |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Permissive: determine what a trustee may do. They are acts which are authorised but not compulsory. | Mandatory: determine what a trustee must do.               |

## Fiduciary Duties

Trustees also have a further set of duties, which stem from the fiduciary nature of their relationship. Fiduciary duties control how trustees go about performing their role and are framed in the negative – what trustees must not do. Fiduciary duties are not just applicable to trustees; they apply to all fiduciaries and are covered in a separate topic.

## Source of Powers and Duties

Many duties have their basis in statute or common law and apply as default rules unless modified by the settlor.

The key statutes are the [Trustee Act 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/contents) and [Trustee Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/contents), though there is other legislation governing specialist areas, such as pension trusts.

The trust instrument (written document containing terms of trust, e.g., trust deed, will) may well contain express provisions setting out the powers and duties of the trustees. It is important to check whether it expressly excludes or modifies any default statutory rules.

## Categorisation

Although the precise powers and duties of trustees will vary depending on the particular trust, they can be divided into two broad categories:

| Category                                          | Explanation                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Administrative powers and duties                  | Relate to the management of the trust property while it is held on trust. |
| Dispositive (or ‘distributive’) powers and duties | Relate to the distribution of trust property in accordance with its terms.                                                                          |

The primary duty of a trustee is to comply with the terms of the trust. While the property is held on trust, their role is custodial in nature. They have an obligation to safeguard the trust property. In many cases, this will mean that the trustees have an obligation to ensure that the trust fund produces income and capital growth.

### Administrative Powers

Trustees therefore have administrative powers which enable them to carry out this function. It is common for trustees to have a power of investment, which is designed to produce income for the trust. They will typically also have broader powers to buy and sell property (which they might need to do for a range of reasons). They may also have the power to raise money by charging existing trust property. Trustees commonly also have powers to delegate some of their functions, including their investment powers.

These administrative powers are typically curtailed by associated duties. Trustees have a duty to exercise their administrative powers in accordance with a prescribed standard of care and skill. They are also usually required to comply with specific rules when exercising their powers.

```ad-example
Trustees exercising the power of investment will usually be under an obligation to take advice and consider standard investment criteria. They also have ongoing obligations to review their investments. 
```

There are common law and statutory rules to consider here, as well as anything specifically set out in the terms of the trust. Trust instruments will usually contain express administrative powers but, if not, there are default powers and duties in the [Trustee Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/contents). It is important to check whether these rules have been amended or excluded.

Administrative powers relate to the management and protection of the trust property while it is held on trust. They do not affect the beneficial interest arising from the trust.

### Dispositive Powers

Dispositive powers relate to the distribution of the trust property to beneficiaries or other objects. They therefore affect the beneficial interest arising from the trust.

As a basic rule, trustees are required to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust.

- In some cases they are required to accumulate income and add it to the trust capital, to be paid out along with the capital when the capital vests in possession.
- In other cases, they are required to distribute income as it arises but continue to hold the trust capital until it is time to distribute it to the beneficiary.

Trustees will also often have dispositive powers, which give them the ability to distribute income or capital. One example is a [[Trustee powers and duties#Power of appointment]], which is more flexible than a discretionary trust because the trustees do not have to exercise it at all.

Trustees also commonly have [[Trustee powers and duties#Maintenance and advancement]]. Powers of maintenance are common in trusts involving minors. Normally, a minor beneficiary will not be allowed to receive income from the trust fund. Instead, it’s accumulated and added to their capital. But a power of maintenance allows the trustees to apply the trust income to maintain a beneficiary. This can be really useful where a minor beneficiary needs money to fund education, for example.

Trustees will also typically have a power to advance capital to or for a beneficiary before their interest vests in possession. Again, this can be useful when a minor beneficiary wants early access to their capital. It can also be used in cases where a beneficiary has a contingent interest.

## Breach

There is a clear relationship between powers and duties.

Trustees may only act within their powers. When exercising those powers, they are subject to duties which relate to the proper exercise of the powers.

A trustee will breach the trust if they either act outside their powers or fail to comply with their duties. Examples of breach of trust therefore include making an unauthorised investment, failing to act in accordance with their duty of care when making an investment and distributing property to someone who is not a beneficiary.

A trustee might also breach their fiduciary duties, whether or not they have breached the trust. In some cases, a trustee may be liable for breach of fiduciary duty even though they have done everything right in terms of their trustee duties and seemingly caused no harm to the trust fund.

```ad-example
Consider a trustee who uses their powers of investment to benefit both the trust fund and themselves (perhaps by investing in their own business). Although the investment might be a good one for the trust, the trustee may still have breached their fiduciary duties by putting themselves in a position of conflict or by personally profiting from the opportunity.
```

It is important to be able to distinguish fiduciary duties from trustee duties because breach of fiduciary duty is a difference cause of action with different consequences to a breach of trust.

## Investment and Delegation

Many express trusts confer extensive administrative powers on trustees. These powers are often set out in the trust instrument.

In the absence of such express powers, there are default powers set out in the [Trustee Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/contents) (‘TA 2000’). The Act also sets out the duties that apply to the exercise of those powers. These powers and associated duties can be excluded or modified by the settlor.

The following statutory powers and associated duties are explored:

- General power of investment ([s 3 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/3))
- Power to acquire land ([s 8 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/8))
- Power of delegation ([s 11 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/11))

### General Powers of Investment

[s 3 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/3) sets out the general power of investment. Under this provision, a trustee may make any kind of investment that they could make if they were absolutely entitled to the assets of the trusts.

Note that s 3 includes the general power to invest in loans over land, but s 8 bequeaths the power to invest in legal estates (in the UK).

When exercising the general power of investment, trustees must:

- Consider the standard investment criteria set out in [s 4 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/4)
- Take advice in accordance with [s 5 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/5)

In carrying out these functions, trustees must act in accordance with the general duty of care set out in [s 1 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/1).

These obligations can be excluded, restricted or extended ([s 6 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/6)).

### Standard Investment Criteria

The standard investment criteria are found in [s 4 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/4). Trustees must consider the criteria when deciding whether to make an investment (s4(1)) in the first place. Trustees also have a duty to regularly review investments with reference to the standard investment criteria and decide whether they ought to be varied. There are two key components to the criteria:

| Component                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suitability (s 4(3)(a))      | Trustees must consider the suitability of the proposed investments. This includes (a) the general suitability of the type of investment, and (b) the specific suitability of the particular investment. |
| Diversification (s 4(3)(b)) | Trustees must also consider the need for diversification of trust investments. The extent to which diversification is needed will depend on the size and nature of the particular trust.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

```ad-statute
title: s 4 TA 2000
(1) In exercising any power of investment, whether arising under this Part or otherwise, a trustee must have regard to the standard investment criteria.

(2) A trustee must from time to time review the investments of the trust and consider whether, having regard to the standard investment criteria, they should be varied.

(3) The standard investment criteria, in relation to a trust, are—
- (a) the suitability to the trust of investments of the same kind as any particular investment proposed to be made or retained and of that particular investment as an investment of that kind, and
- (b) the need for diversification of investments of the trust, in so far as is appropriate to the circumstances of the trust. 
```

#### Suitability

The question of suitability will be highly fact-specific. A suitable investment for one trust fund may be entirely unsuitable for another. In considering this question, trustees must balance the duty to preserve the trust assets against the need to produce appropriate growth on the investment. Key issues that trustees will need to consider when assessing suitability include:

- The size of the trust fund
- The period of time for which the trust is intended to subsist
- The respective rights of different beneficiaries

```ad-example
The trustees of a large, commercial trust fund which is intended to subsist for many years will have a greater degree of freedom to invest in assets which are intended to produce long-term growth, compared to the trustees of a small family trust which is only intended to last for a short period of time.

If the family trust includes both life and remainder interests, the trustees will also need to ensure that any investments produce income for the life tenant as well as capital growth for the remainderman. Trustees must act even-handedly between beneficiaries.
```

#### Diversification

The requirement to consider diversifying the trust investments reflects the principles of modern portfolio theory.

This involves taking an overall approach to the risk profile of the trust fund rather than considering each investment on an individual basis. It allows trustees to invest in a mixture of high and low risk investments, rather than investing exclusively in low risk (and therefore probably low yield) investments. Trustees should also invest across a range of different types of assets, so that the trust fund is not overly exposed to the risks of losses in a particular sector.

Again, the extent to which trustees can diversify the investments will depend on the size and nature of the trust fund, with larger funds able to spread their investments across a wider range of assets. Smaller trust funds may not be able to diversify in the same way but the trustees may consider investing in investment funds, which pool the assets of multiple investors and allow them to obtain the benefits of diversification.

A key case on investment is [[Cowan v Scargill [1985] Ch 270]], which sets out the following principles:

- When considering the suitability of trust investments, the trustee obligation to act in the best interests of beneficiaries means their best financial interests.
- The trustees must balance the interests of all beneficiaries (current and future).
- The personal views of the trustees are not relevant to this assessment. Trustees must exercise their powers fairly and honestly, and not for any ulterior purpose.
- Although the ‘best interests’ of the beneficiaries could be construed more widely in some cases, allowing trustees to take into account moral and ethical concerns (such as in cases where all beneficiaries are adults of sound mind who share those concerns and would not wish to benefit from an investment they consider immoral or unethical) this will be extremely rare in practice.
- Although trustees are not bound to follow the advice they receive on investments, they cannot ignore it simply because they personally disagree with it. They can only do so if they consider that a reasonably prudent trustee would act in the same way.

### Qualifications

Although moral and ethical considerations will not generally be relevant to trustee decisions, this does not stop trustees preferring ethical investments if they have a straightforward choice between two investments of economical equivalence. As we have already seen, the trustees can also take into account the ethical views of beneficiaries, where the beneficiaries are all of sound mind and agree on the decision.

There is also more scope to take non-financial considerations into account in the case of charitable trusts. In particular, charitable trustees may refrain from making investments which might conflict with the aims of the charity or hamper its work. For example, trustees of a cancer research charity would not be expected to invest in the tobacco industry, even if this was the most profitable investment available. Trustees can also consider whether making ethically questionable investments is likely to undermine the work of the charity (e.g., by deterring potential donors from supporting the charity). Trustees would be required to balance the risk to the charity of financial loss from not making the investment against the detriment and disadvantages to the charity of making the investment.

### Delegation of Investment Powers

Investment powers can be delegated to an agent, who will be bound by any restriction on the exercise of those powers in the same way as would be the trustee. So an agent who is authorised to exercise the general power of investment must also have regard to the standard investment criteria. An agent is not required to obtain investment advice if they are the kind of person from whom it would have been proper for the trustees to obtain such advice, such as a financial advisor.

The trustees may not delegate to one of the trust beneficiaries.

### Advice

Under [s 5 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/5) trustees are required to obtain and consider ‘proper advice’ before exercising their powers of investment (s 5(1)) and when reviewing their investments (s 5(2)). The advice must relate to how the power should be exercised, with reference to the standard investment criteria.

‘Proper advice’ is defined in s 5(4) as being provided by a person

> ‘who is reasonably believed by the trustee to be qualified to give it’ by their ‘ability in and practical experience of financial and other matters relating to the proposed investment’.

There is an exception set out in s 5(3) which provides that trustees need not seek advice if they reasonably conclude that in all the circumstances it is unnecessary to do so. This will depend on the circumstances but might, for example, include situations where the cost of the advice outweighs the benefit of obtaining it or cases where the trustee has sufficient knowledge and expertise to make the decision without advice.

```ad-statute
title: s 5 TA 2000
(1) Before exercising any power of investment, whether arising under this Part or otherwise, a trustee must (unless the exception applies) obtain and consider proper advice about the way in which, having regard to the standard investment criteria, the power should be exercised.

(2) When reviewing the investments of the trust, a trustee must (unless the exception applies) obtain and consider proper advice about whether, having regard to the standard investment criteria, the investments should be varied.

(3) The exception is that a trustee need not obtain such advice if he reasonably concludes that in all the circumstances it is unnecessary or inappropriate to do so.

(4) Proper advice is the advice of a person who is reasonably believed by the trustee to be qualified to give it by his ability in and practical experience of financial and other matters relating to the proposed investment.
```

### Statutory Duty of Care

The statutory duty of care is found in [s 1 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/1) and requires trustees to

> ‘exercise such care and skill as is reasonable in the circumstances’.

- Section 1(1)(a) requires the assessment to take into account ‘any special knowledge or experience’ that a trustee has or holds themselves out as having.
- Section 1(1)(b) applies to professional trustees and requires the assessment to take into account any ‘special knowledge or experience’ that it is reasonable to expect of a person acting in that capacity.

```ad-statute
title: s 1 TA 2000
(1) Whenever the duty under this subsection applies to a trustee, he must exercise such care and skill as is reasonable in the circumstances, having regard in particular—
- (a) to any special knowledge or experience that he has or holds himself out as having, and
- (b) if he acts as trustee in the course of a business or profession, to any special knowledge or experience that it is reasonable to expect of a person acting in the course of that kind of business or profession.

(2) In this Act the duty under subsection (1) is called “the duty of care”.
```

In other words, the standard of care is always higher for professional trustees, because they are being paid to provide a service.

It is also raised for lay trustees who may have been appointed on the basis of having (or purporting to have) particular skills that would make them desirable trustees.

This is why it is important for individuals to think carefully about whether to accept the role of trustee, as their actions will be assessed objectively.

```ad-warning
The statutory duty of care does not apply to all acts of a trustee, but only to those set out in [Sch 1 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/schedule/1). Generally, the statutory duty of care only applies to administrative functions, so the common law duty (see below) will ony apply to the exercise of dispositive functions, though the preferable view is that there is no relevant difference between the statutory and common law duties of care.
```

### Common Law Duty of Care

There is also a common law duty of care which applies more widely. Broadly, it requires trustees to exercise the standard of diligence and care expected of an ordinary prudent business person.

Case law on investment predating the TA 2000 applies the common law duty of care. It is generally considered that there is nothing inconsistent between the two standards (with the TA 2000 codifying the duty of care in certain circumstances). Earlier case law therefore remains useful in assessing whether a trustee has complied with the statutory duty of care.

### Power to Acquire Land

[s 8 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/8): Trustees have a statutory power to acquire freehold or leasehold land in the UK (but not overseas). This power may be exercised for investment purposes, but also more widely (including for occupation by a beneficiary).

If the land is acquired for investment purposes, the trustees must consider the standard investment criteria and take advice in accordance with ss 4 and 5 TA 2000 respectively.

The statutory duty of care applies to all trustee powers to acquire land, whether they arise under s 8 or otherwise, and whether the land is acquired for investment or other purposes.

```ad-statute
title: s 8 TA 2000
(1) A trustee may acquire freehold or leasehold land in the United Kingdom—
- (a) as an investment,
- (b) for occupation by a beneficiary, or
- (c) for any other reason.

(2) “Freehold or leasehold land” means—
- (a) in relation to England and Wales, a legal estate in land, ...

(3) For the purpose of exercising his functions as a trustee, a trustee who acquires land under this section has all the powers of an absolute owner in relation to the land.
```

### Power of Delegation

[s 11 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/11) provides trustees with broad powers of delegation. Although there are some functions which trustees cannot delegate (such as their distributive obligations) they are permitted to delegate their powers of investment and powers to acquire land.

```ad-statute
title: s 11 TA 2000
(1 )Subject to the provisions of this Part, the trustees of a trust may authorise any person to exercise any or all of their delegable functions as their agent.

(2) In the case of a trust other than a charitable trust, the trustees’ delegable functions consist of any function other than—
- (a) any function relating to whether or in what way any assets of the trust should be distributed,
- (b) any power to decide whether any fees or other payment due to be made out of the trust funds should be made out of income or capital,
- (c) any power to appoint a person to be a trustee of the trust, or
- (d) any power conferred by any other enactment or the trust instrument which permits the trustees to delegate any of their functions or to appoint a person to act as a nominee or custodian.
```

```ad-warning
All decisions about the exercise of dispositive functions must be made by the trustees rather than delegated to an agent.
```

Trustees cannot delegate their investment powers except by an agreement evidenced in writing ([s 15 TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/15)). This agreement should include a term ensuring compliance with a written ‘policy statement’ to be prepared by the trustees. The ‘policy statement’ should give guidance as to how the agent should exercise their functions, ensuring they are in line with the best interests of the beneficiaries.

The agent to whom the function is delegated is bound by any restrictions on the exercise of its investment powers in the same way the trustee would be ([s 13(1) TA 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/29/section/13)).

There are two primary reasons why a trustee might wish to delegate their functions:

- The trustee may be incapable of discharging their duties for a limited period.
- The trustee lacks the expertise to discharge the particular responsibility and prefers to have an expert do this.
- Trustees are required to comply with the statutory duty of care both with respect to selecting agents and entering into agreements with those agents.

As such, the trustees should ensure:

- An appropriate agent is selected for the function
- The agreement complies with their requirements under statute
- The arrangement is reviewed regularly

If trustees comply with their duties when exercising the power of delegation, they will not be vicariously liable for any loss caused by the agent acting negligently.

### Power of Appointment

The nature of a power of appointment depends on whether it is a trust power or fiduciary power.

- If it is a trust power, trustees are required to make the appointment but have discretion as to who should receive the trust property
- If it is a fiduciary power, the trustees may make the appointment if they wish to do so, but are obliged to consider whether the power should be exercised.

Generally, if the trustees *must* exercise the power, it is a trust power, and if they *may* exercise it, it is a fiduciary duty.

## Dispositive Duties

There are three broad circumstances in which trustees distribute trust property:

- When they have an obligation to do so under the terms of the trust
- When directed to do so by beneficiaries with Saunders v Vautier rights
- In exercise of a dispositive power such as a power of appointment, maintenance or advancement

### Duty to Distribute

When beneficiaries have a right to income or capital under the terms of a trust, the trustees are under an obligation to make the payments to the beneficiaries as soon as possible. The trustees must not wait for the beneficiaries to demand the payment.

For example, if a trustee holds money on trust for a minor beneficiary until the beneficiary reaches 18, the beneficiary will have a right to receive the money when they reach 18. The trustee must therefore pay the money to the beneficiary when they reach that age. Failure to do so will constitute a breach of trust.

It is important to check the trust terms to determine whether the trustee has the power to accumulate the income (i.e. add it to the capital) or if it must be paid out. If the trustees are required to distribute income, they must do so within a reasonable period after its receipt.

```ad-example
title: Minors
A trustee holds £1,000 on trust for each of A, B and C. A is 14. B is 15. C has just turned 18. What are the trustee’s obligations?

A, B and C all have vested interests:
- Because A and B are minors, the trustee must continue to hold the money on trust for them until they reach the age of 18.
- As C has just turned 18, the trustee must distribute their £1,000 to them as soon as possible. This will bring the trust for C to an end.
```

```ad-example
title: Successive interests

A trustee holds property on trust for A for life, remainder to B. Both beneficiaries are over 18.

What are the trustee’s obligations?
- A has a vested interest in the income: The trustee is required to distribute the income to A during A’s lifetime.
- B has a vested interest in the capital: After A’s death, B’s interest will vest in possession. The trustee must then transfer the trust property to B, bringing the trust to an end.
- A and B could also agree to exercise their _Saunders v Vautier_ rights and direct the trustee to transfer the property to them or a third party, in the shares that they choose. The trustee will be obliged to comply with this direction.
```

### Liability for Wrongful Distribution

There may be times when trustees are unsure of how to carry out their obligations. For example, they may be unsure of how to interpret the provision of a trust deed. Alternatively, the trust provisions may be clear but the trustees may be unsure as to how to distribute the trust fund because they are unable to identify or locate some or all of the beneficiaries.

In such cases, the trustees must still fulfil their duty to distribute but can take steps to avoid liability for breach of trust. These include:

- Advertising for claimants
- Retaining a fund or paying money into court
- Seeking directions from the court
- Taking out insurance against wrongful distribution

### Court Directions

If the trustees are unsure of their obligations, or wish to ensure that their plans for distributing the trust property will not expose them to a claim for breach of trust, the prudent thing to do is seek directions from the court. Trustees who act in accordance with the directions of the court will not be liable even if there is a subsequent claim from a beneficiary.

It is common to seek what is known as a **Benjamin order** in cases where a known beneficiary cannot be found and is presumed dead. This is an order directing that the trustees are free to distribute property to other beneficiaries and prevents the trustees being susceptible to a claim from the missing beneficiary if it transpires that they are still alive.

In [[Re Benjamin [1902] 1 Ch 723]] itself the son of the testator had disappeared approximately a year before the testator died. The trustees made an application to the court for directions as to how to distribute the estate.

After reviewing evidence that it was highly likely the son had died, a special order was made by the court allowing the trustees to distribute the estate on the basis that the son had not survived.

The Benjamin order was expanded by [[Re Green’s Will Trusts [1985] 3 All ER 455]], where the testator had expressly left all her property to her son in her will, fully aware that he had gone missing several years previously and was certified presumed dead.

The testator set out in her will that should her son not claim the estate before 2020 it would go to charity. Nourse J went against the testator's express wishes and made an order that the executors could distribute the estate to charity.

```ad-warning
If a trustee distributes the entirety of a trust fund in accordance with a Benjamin order and a missing beneficiary is later found, the trustee will not be liable to the missing beneficiary but the beneficiary may make a proprietary or receipt-based claim against other beneficiaries who have been overpaid as a result of the distribution.
```

### Unknown Beneficiaries: Advertisements

In some cases, the trustees may be unsure as to whether they have properly identified all the beneficiaries. For example, the trustees may have an obligation to divide trust property equally between a conceptually certain class of individuals (e.g. the nieces and nephews of the settlor) but are unsure who all those people are.

To prevent liability to unidentified beneficiaries, the trustees may put an advertisement in a national newspaper, giving notice of their intention to distribute to known beneficiaries two months after the advertisement. This puts unknown beneficiaries on notice that they must identify themselves to the trustees. After the two month notice period, the trustees may distribute to known beneficiaries and will have no personal liability to the unknown beneficiaries.

This will only absolve trustees of liability to beneficiaries whose claims the trustees remain unaware of at the end of this period.

### Beneficiaries Coming Forwards Later

The options above will have serious implications for a beneficiary who comes forward subsequently. As the trustee will be protected against any personal claims from such a beneficiary, they will not have a right to recover personally from the trustees.

Where the property has been distributed the only option for a beneficiary will be a proprietary or receipt-based claim against the recipient of the property.

However, if the property has not been fully distributed, it will still be possible for the beneficiary to claim any undistributed property from the trustee.

### Retained Funds

Another option is for the trustees to retain a fund setting aside trust assets in order to be able to discharge liabilities if the missing beneficiaries come forward after distribution.

This is also an option in cases where the trustees remain unsure as whether they have identified all potential beneficiaries. In such cases, they may choose to distribute to the known beneficiaries but hold some money back in case other beneficiaries come forward in future.

This is quite a risky strategy in cases of unknown beneficiaries as it will be difficult for the trustees to quantify the respective interests of the known and unknown beneficiaries, and could well result in a claim against the trustees for having paid out the wrong amount to the known beneficiaries.

Alternatively, in circumstances where trustees can establish genuine doubt as to the location of beneficiaries, or are unable to give receipts, they can pay money into the court, giving the court legal control over the funds and allowing the trustees to effectively retire: [s 26(1) TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/26).

### Insurance

Trustees may decide to take out insurance to guard against the risk of missing or unknown beneficiaries emerging after the trust fund has been distributed.

The trustees may simply take out insurance and then distribute in accordance with the information they have available. If a beneficiary later comes forward, the trustees will be liable to them but can claim on the insurance policy.

Risk-averse trustees may well choose to use insurance alongside another mitigation measure such as advertisements or seeking directions from the court. This would be a more prudent approach.

> - Taking out insurance against wrongful distribution.

> Although some of these options prevent the trustees being personally liable, beneficiaries can still make claims against other beneficiaries who may receive more than their rightful share as a result of the trustees’ actions.

## Maintenance and Advancement

When considering their dispositive powers and obligations it is important for trustees to distinguish between the trust capital and the income generated by that capital.

- In some cases different beneficiaries will be entitled to the income and the capital. A good example is a life interest trust.
- In other cases, the same beneficiary may be entitled to both capital and income but not necessarily at the same time:
	- A beneficiary may have a right to receive capital upon the occurrence of a particular event, such as reaching a specified age. In the meantime, they may be entitled to receive the income as it arises.
	- Alternatively, the trustees may have a power or obligation to accumulate the income (i.e. add it to the capital). If the income is accumulated, the beneficiary will not receive anything until it is time for the capital to be distributed.

Can a beneficiary ever make an early claim to the capital or accumulated income?

### Entitlement to Income

Adult beneficiaries with vested interests in trust property will usually have a right to receive the trust income as it arises.

Adult beneficiaries with contingent interests have a statutory right under [s 31(3) Trustee Act 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/31) (‘TA 1925’) to receive income if the trust ‘carries the intermediate income’ (i.e., the income produced between creation of the contingent interest and satisfaction of the contingency). The circumstances in which a trust ‘carries the intermediate income’ are beyond the scope of this module. If it is relevant to the analysis, a question will specify whether a contingent interest carries the intermediate income.

Minor beneficiaries will not usually be entitled to receive trust income until they reach the age of 18.

However, s 31(1) TA 1925 gives the trustees a **power of maintenance**. This allows the trustees to pay trust income to beneficiaries who would benefit from receiving it immediately, instead of waiting for their interest to vest in possession.

Note that the provisions of s 31 TA 1925 may be excluded or varied by a trust instrument: [s 69(2) TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/69).

### Power of Maintenance

```ad-statute
title: s 31 TA 1925 -  Power to apply income for maintenance and to accumulate surplus income during a minority.

(1) Where any property is held by trustees in trust for any person for any interest whatsoever, whether vested or contingent, then, subject to any prior interests or charges affecting that property—
- (i) during the infancy of any such person, if his interest so long continues, the trustees may, at their sole discretion, pay to his parent or guardian, if any, or otherwise apply for or towards his maintenance, education, or benefit, the whole or such part, if any, of the income of that property as the trustees may think fit, whether or not there is—
	- (a) any other fund applicable to the same purpose; or
	- (b) any person bound by law to provide for his maintenance or education; and
- (ii) if such person on attaining the age of eighteen years has not a vested interest in such income, the trustees shall thenceforth pay the income of that property and of any accretion thereto under subsection (2) of this section to him, until he either attains a vested interest therein or dies, or until failure of his interest:

(2) During the infancy of any such person, if his interest so long continues, the trustees shall accumulate all the residue of that income by investing it, and any profits from so investing it from time to time in authorised investments, and shall hold those accumulations as follows:—
- (i) If any such person—
	- (a) attains the age of eighteen years, or marries under that age or forms a civil partnership under that age, and his interest in such income during his infancy, or until his marriage or his formation of a civil partnership, is a vested interest or;
	- (b) on attaining the age of eighteen years or on marriage, or formation of a civil partnership, under that age becomes entitled to the property from which such income arose in fee simple, absolute or determinable, or absolutely, or for an entailed interest;
- the trustees shall hold the accumulations in trust for such person absolutely, but without prejudice to any provision with respect thereto contained in any settlement by him made under any statutory powers during his infancy, and so that the receipt of such person after marriage or formation of a civil partnership, and though still an infant shall be a good discharge, and
- (ii) In any other case the trustees shall, notwithstanding that such person had a vested interest in such income, hold the accumulations as an accretion to the capital of the property from which such accumulations arose, and as one fund with such capital for all purposes, and so that, if such property is settled land, such accumulations shall be held upon the same trusts as if the same were capital money arising therefrom;

but the trustees may, at any time during the infancy of such person if his interest so long continues, apply those accumulations, or any part thereof, as if they were income arising in the then current year.

(3) This section applies in the case of a contingent interest only if the limitation or trust carries the intermediate income of the property, but it applies to a future or contingent legacy by the parent of, or a person standing in loco parentis to, the legatee, if and for such period as, under the general law, the legacy carries interest for the maintenance of the legatee, and in any such case as last aforesaid the rate of interest shall (if the income available is sufficient, and subject to any rules of court to the contrary) be five pounds per centum per annum.

(4) This section applies to a vested annuity in like manner as if the annuity were the income of property held by trustees in trust to pay the income thereof to the annuitant for the same period for which the annuity is payable, save that in any case accumulations made during the infancy of the annuitant shall be held in trust for the annuitant or his personal representatives absolutely.

(5) This section does not apply where the instrument, if any, under which the interest arises came into operation before the commencement of this Act.
```

Where a minor has a vested interest in trust property (or a contingent interest which carries the intermediate income), the trustees have a wide statutory power under [s 31 TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/31) to pay the income as they think fit. The trustees may:

- Pay the income to the child or their parent or guardian.
- Apply the income directly for the child’s ‘maintenance, education or benefit’.

This power may be used even if there is another fund available for the same purpose or other persons legally obliged to provide for the child.

Income which is not paid out under s 31 must be accumulated but can still be paid out subsequently using the power of maintenance as long as the beneficiary remains under 18.

Once the beneficiary reaches 18, the accumulated income is added to the capital and can no longer be accessed by the beneficiary until they are entitled to receive the capital.

Income generated after the beneficiary is 18 must be paid directly to them. Although the power of maintenance gives the trustees a broad discretion, the following points must be noted:

1. The power of maintenance is a **fiduciary power**. The trustees must consciously consider the exercise of the power and, if they choose to exercise it, must act in good faith in the interests of the beneficiary.
2. The income must be used for the primary benefit of the minor beneficiary, but it does not matter that it may therefore indirectly benefit their parent or guardian.
3. It is an improper exercise of the power to unquestioningly pay it to the minor’s parent or guardian See e.g. [[Wilson v Turner (1883) 22 Ch. D. 521]]

Because the power of maintenance only applies during the minority of a beneficiary, it is good practice for trustees to consider exercising the power shortly before the beneficiary turns 18, particularly if the beneficiary has a contingent interest to the trust capital.

If it is not exercised at this time, all accumulated income will become part of the trust capital and the beneficiary will not be able to access it until their interest in the capital vests.

```ad-example
A testator leaves an estate on trust for A (26), B (19) and C (16) in equal shares upon their reaching 25.

A has reached the age of 25 so their share has vested in possession and should be distributed.

B’s share has vested in interest. Until B reaches 25, the income generated by B’s share must be paid to B. (Note that B has _Saunders v Vautier_ rights so could choose to collapse their share before this).

C is a minor and until C reaches the age of 18 the trustees have the power (but not the obligation) to pay income to C’s parent or guardian (or otherwise apply it for C’s maintenance, education and benefit e.g., by paying school fees directly to the school). Income not used is accumulated.
```

S 31 is commonly expressly amended to defer a beneficiary's right to income, meaning they become entitled to both income and capital at the same time.

### Power to Advance Capital

```ad-statute
title: s 32 TA 1925 - Power of advancement

(1) Trustees may at any time or times pay or apply any capital money subject to a trust, or transfer or apply any other property forming part of the capital of the trust property, for the advancement or benefit, in such manner as they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit, of any person entitled to the capital of the trust property or of any share thereof, whether absolutely or contingently on his attaining any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, or subject to a gift over on his death under any specified age or on the occurrence of any other event, and whether in possession or in remainder or reversion, and such payment, transfer or application may be made notwithstanding that the interest of such person is liable to be defeated by the exercise of a power of appointment or revocation, or to be diminished by the increase of the class to which he belongs:

Provided that—

- (a) property (including any money) so paid, transferred or applied for the advancement or benefit of any person must not, altogether, represent more than the presumptive or vested share or interest of that person in the trust property; and
- (b) if that person is or becomes absolutely and indefeasibly entitled to a share in the trust property the money or other property so paid, transferred or applied shall be brought into account as part of such share; and
- (c) no such payment, transfer or application shall be made so as to prejudice any person entitled to any prior life or other interest, whether vested or contingent, in the money or other property paid, transferred or applied unless such person is in existence and of full age and consents in writing to such payment or application.
- (1A) In exercise of the foregoing power trustees may pay, transfer or apply money or other property on the basis (express or implied) that it shall be treated as a proportionate part of the capital out of which it was paid, transferred or applied, for the purpose of bringing it into account in accordance with proviso (b) to subsection (1) of this section.

(2) This section does not apply to capital money arising under the M1 Settled Land Act 1925.

(3) This section does not apply to trusts constituted or created before the commencement of this Act.
```

A beneficiary who expects to receive capital from a trust at a future date may wish to receive their capital before it vests in possession.

[s 32 TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/32) gives trustees the power to use capital for the ‘advancement or benefit’ of a beneficiary before the beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled to the property.

The power of advancement:

- May be used by both adult and minor beneficiaries
- Applies to both vested and contingent interests
- Can be modified or excluded by the trust instrument: [s 69(2) TA 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/69)

The trustees may use the power of advancement to pay up to 100% of a beneficiary’s entitlement before it vests at all (if the interest is contingent) or before it vests in possession (if the interest is vested in interest).

Because the exercise of the power may prejudice other beneficiaries, the power may only be exercised with the written consent of beneficiaries with a prior interest.

For example, if a trustee holds property on trust for A for life, remainder to B, the trustees can only exercise the power of advancement in favour of B with A’s written consent. This is because providing B with their capital early will clearly prejudice A.

- In the most extreme case, if B requests 100% of their capital, A’s life interest will be extinguished.
- Even if B requests less than 100% of their capital, this will reduce the value of A’s interest as there will be smaller capital fund from which to generate A’s income.

Consent can only be provided by beneficiaries who are of full age and sound mind.

### Meaning of ‘advancement’

A key issue for trustees when deciding whether to exercise the power of advancement is whether this action will result in the advancement or benefit of the beneficiary. Over time the case law in this area has developed to recognise a broader meaning of advancement than its previous limitations to the areas of education, career and marriage.

Advancement has now been recognised to provide for an immediate financial benefit for a beneficiary, such as to avoid an inheritance tax liability, [[Pilkington v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1964] AC 612]]. In this case Viscount Radcliffe defined advancement as ‘any use of the money which will improve the material situation of the beneficiary’.

Subsequent case law indicates that the advancement of the beneficiary can include the improvement of the beneficiary’s moral well-being by giving the money for charitable purposes, but only to the extent that the beneficiary would have otherwise used their own resources for such purposes (see [[Re Clore’s Settlement Trusts [1966] 1 WLR 955]] and [[X v A [2006] 1 WLR 741]])_.

Trustees have a duty following the exercise of the power of advancement to ensure that the money is being used for the purposes that it was provided. Should the beneficiary be found to be spending the money on something else, the trustees should not pay any further money to the beneficiary. However, they may instead pay money directly to a third party for the advancement of the beneficiary instead.

In [[Re Pauling’s Settlement Trusts [1964] Ch 303]] the trust was managed by a bank with a power to advance property to the children of a marriage. The bank made a number of advancements to the children. These advancements were used for the benefit of the children’s parents rather than their own benefit, including the purchase of a house in the parents’ names. It was found that the trustees were obliged to check that the money had been applied for the purpose that it was advanced and not leave the recipients free to spend the money as they wished. The bank’s failure to do this was a breach of trust.

### Bringing the Payment into Account

The trustees may use the power of advancement to pay up to 100% of a beneficiary’s [[beneficial entitlement]].

Any such payment must be brought into account when the beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled. In other words, the amount that the beneficiary will receive when their interest vests will be reduced proportionately to reflect the proportion of the capital that they received early.

Trustees have a choice between treating the share advanced as a **proportionate share of the overall trust value or its strict monetary value**. The choice they make could have significant consequences for both the beneficiary who receives the advancement and all the other beneficiaries. This is best illustrated by way of example.

```ad-example
Trustees hold a trust fund worth £20,000 on trust for A, B, C and D in equal shares when they reach 18. The trustees exercise the power of advancement to pay £5,000 to A. The trustees must choose whether this is to be treated as A's proportionate share of the fund. This could make a significant difference to A as £5,000 would amount to 100% of A's share in the trust fund at the date it was paid.

If the £5,000 is treated as A’s proportionate share, A will no longer be entitled to anything from the trust fund, regardless of how much the fund is worth when A reaches 18.

For example, if the fund grows to £25,000 this will be shared equally between B, C and D (£8,333 each).

If the £5,000 is not treated as A’s proportionate share, the trustees will take A’s payment into account before making their distributions, bringing the total trust value to £30,000. That is then shared equally between all four beneficiaries. B,C and D each receive £7,500. A has already had £5,000 so is entitled to an additional £2,500.
