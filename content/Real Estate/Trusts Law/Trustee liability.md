# Trustee liability

## Breach of Trust

Trustees have two main types of duty:

1. Trustee duties
	- A primary duty to comply with the terms of the trust (i.e., to distribute trust property only in accordance with those terms and a custodial duty over the property in the meantime).
	- Duties to exercise their functions as trustees in accordance with prescribed standards of care and skill, which are aimed at safeguarding the trust fund.
2. Fiduciary duties
	- A duty not to create conflict between their personal interests and their duties to the beneficiaries.
	- A duty not to make an unauthorised profit from their role as a trustee.

## Liability for Breach of Trust

Trustees can commit a breach of trust by:

- Acting outside their powers (e.g., by distributing trust property to someone other than a beneficiary or making an unauthorised investment).
- Failing to act in accordance with their duties (e.g., by falling below the standard of care expected of them when making an authorised investment or failing to properly monitor investments of the trust fund).

### Structure

In order to establish liability for breach of trust two questions should therefore be asked:

1. Did the trustee(s) act in accordance with their powers?
2. If so, did they comply with their trustee duties?

If there has been a breach of trust, ask:

- Who has breached the trust?
- Is there anything that might exclude or limit the liability of any of the trustees?
- What remedy should be awarded?
- If more than one trustee is liable, how should liability be apportioned between them?

```ad-example
A trust fund includes a majority shareholding in a private company.

What should the trustees do in order to properly monitor this investment?

Where trust investments include company shares, the trustees will need to monitor the investment to ensure it produces an appropriate amount of income and capital growth (and to enable them to determine whether to sell the shares if not). If the trust only holds a small number of shares, the trustees are limited in what they can do, beyond reviewing publicly available information and anything provided to them as shareholders.

If, however, the trust has a majority shareholding in the company, this gives the trustees power over that company, which they are expected to make use of to safeguard the investment. This could involve using their shareholding to have a trustee appointed as a director, giving them greater oversight and an ability to affect decisions of the company. See [[Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Limited [1980] Ch 515]].
```

### Identifying Who Breached Trust

Where a trust has more than one trustee, it is necessary to identify which of the trustees has committed the breach.

As trusteeship is a joint office, it will often be the case that more than one trustee will be liable, although they may be liable for breaches in different ways. For example, one trustee may misapply trust property and be actively responsible for a breach, while the other trustees may be liable for failing to monitor the actions of their co-trustees. Where multiple trustees have breached the trust, they will be jointly and severally liable.

```ad-example
A is a professional trustee and breaches their duty of care by authorising an investment without considering the standard investment criteria. B is a co-trustee and lay person, who agrees to the investment on the basis that A has suggested it. Both trustees have breached the trust. A has actively breached it by making the investment while B has breached it by failing to properly turn their own mind to the matter.
```

### Liability Before Appointment as Trustee

A trustee will not be liable for a breach of trust which took place before the trustee was appointed (see [[Re Strahan (1856) 8 De GM & G 291]]).

On appointment, if a trustee discovers that a breach of trust occurred, they should commence proceedings in order to recover from the former trustee. Failure to take such action may result in the new trustee becoming liable for their own breach of trust.

### Liability After Retirement

A trustee will continue to be liable for any breaches committed during the time that they acted as a trustee, even after they have retired.

A trustee will only be liable for breaches of trust that occur after they retire, in two cases:

- Where the trustee retired to facilitate the breach; or
- The trustee parts with trust property in retiring without due regard, so loss is suffered when the property is transferred to the new trustees (see [[Head v Gould [1989] 2 Ch 250, 272]]).

### Exclusion and Limitation of Liability

It is possible for the liability of trustees to be excluded or limited by an exemption clause in the trust instrument. The courts have recognised that it is possible to exempt trustees from liability for breach of trust, other than where the breach is fraudulent ([[Armitage v Nurse [1998] Ch 241]]).

If there is no exemption clause, trustees may seek to rely on [s 61 Trustee Act 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/61) (TA 1925). This gives the court discretion to excuse a trustee in circumstances where the trustee:

> ‘Acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust’.

The courts will not use s 61 lightly, as it may deny the beneficiaries a remedy (although note that it can be used to excuse individual trustees while others remain liable). A good example of a situation where it might be applicable is a case where trustees have sought and relied on legal advice before taking a course of action.

#### Limitation Period

As with other civil law claims (such as claims in tort or for breach of contract) there are legal limitation periods applicable to claims for breach of trust.

Under [s 21(1)(a) Limitation Act 1980](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/21) the limitation period for bringing a claim for breach of trust is **six years** from the breach. However, this only applies to claims by beneficiaries with interests vested in possession. For beneficiaries with future interests, the limitation period only starts to run when their interest vests in possession.

**The limitation period does not apply to fraudulent breaches or proprietary claims against the trustee** (i.e., claims to recover trust property or its traceable proceeds from the trustee).

If a trustee is also a beneficiary, and receives an unfairly large distribution from the trust, only the excess can be recovered after the normal six-year period (unless the trustee acted dishonestly or unreasonably in making the distribution, in which case it may be possible to make a claim for the full amount of the payment).

Another means of protecting trustees from liability is by obtaining indemnity insurance. This will be common in the case of professional trustees, but is possible in all cases, to prevent the trustee personally bearing the cost of a breach.

Although not strictly relevant to this element, it is worth noting that insurance can also be useful to ensure that the trustee does not have to personally compensate creditors of the trust for acts undertaken in their capacity as trustee (which they may be required to do if e.g., the trust fund is insufficient to meet that liability).

It will often be possible to have the insurance premiums paid out of the trust fund as an expense of the trust.

Similarly to exclusion clauses, insurance can protect trustees against liability for negligence but not fraudulent breaches of trust.

### Consent

Trustees will also be excused from liability for breach of trust if they can show that they obtained the fully informed consent of the adult beneficiaries or that those beneficiaries acquiesced ([s 36 (2) Limitation Act 1980](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/36)). Both can provide a partial defence against individual beneficiaries, even if other beneficiaries still have a valid claim.

### Acquiescence

Acquiescence involves the beneficiary being passive (knowing that there has been a breach but failing to take action against the trustee) while consent requires a positive act of authorisation. In some cases, it may even entail instigation by the beneficiary. In both cases, the effect will be that the relevant beneficiary is barred from making a claim.

In cases involving the written consent or instigation of the beneficiary, it can also affect the interest of that beneficiary. Under [s 62 Trustee Act 1925](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/19/section/62) (TA 1925) the court has the discretion to ‘impound’ the beneficiary’s interest under the trust in order to satisfy the claims of the other beneficiaries, meaning compensation will be paid out of their share of the fund. The court will only do this where it is considered ‘just’ to do so, which will usually be in cases where the beneficiary has actively encouraged the breach.

### Remedies

Once a breach of trust has been established, it is necessary to consider the claim the beneficiaries can make. This will depend on the nature and consequences of the breach:

- If the trustee has misapplied trust property, the beneficiaries may seek to recover the property itself (or its traceable proceeds). Broadly, a beneficiary may decide to make such a claim where the trustee is insolvent and/or where the substitute property has increased in value.
- If it is not possible or desirable to recover the trust property, the beneficiaries will instead seek compensation to reflect the loss of the asset.
- Similarly, if a breach of trust has resulted in a loss in the value of the trust fund, the beneficiaries may seek compensation.
- If a breach does not result in a loss, there may be no substantive remedy, although it is possible, in serious cases, that the beneficiaries will wish to have the trustee removed from office.

### Compensation for Loss to the Trust Fund

In recent years, there has been a significant amount of case law dealing with how to assess the loss arising from a breach of trust. The law is complicated, particularly in the case of commercial trusts, but as a broad rule trustees will only be liable for losses where their breach can be shown to be a ‘but for’ cause.

This loss is assessed at the date of the trial, rather than the date of breach.

In simple cases, the loss may be very obvious. For example, if a trustee misapplies a single trust asset, the loss caused will be the value of that asset.

Similarly, if a trustee was required to make a specific investment but failed to do so, the loss will be calculated based on the profit the trust fund would have made if the trustee had made the investment.

If a trustee had a discretion as to how to invest the trust fund but acted in breach of duty when investing, the loss will be based on the investments that a hypothetical prudent trustee would make.

In cases involving lots of interrelated transactions, it may be necessary to look very carefully at the facts to identify the loss that can be attributed to the breach.

Trustees are not liable for losses unless they have breached their duties. They are not insurers.

So, for example, if a trustee makes a prudent investment (and has complied with their obligations to consider the standard investment criteria and consider proper advice) they will not be liable if it happens to fall in value (e.g., due to market forces beyond the trustee’s control). This is not the fault of the trustee, and the trust fund must bear the loss.

However, the trustee may become liable if they continue to hold the investment notwithstanding its poor performance. This would be a breach of their duty to review investments and consider whether to vary them.

Most simply, apply the ‘but for’ test of causation. However, the law of causation is more complicated in practice:

- [[Target Holdings v Redferns [1996] AC 421]]
- [[AIB Group (UK) Plc v Mark Redler & Co Solicitors [2015] AC 1503]]

### Offsetting Losses Against Gains

In general, trustees are not permitted to set off the losses caused by a breach of trust against profits they have made on other investments or transactions.

Trustees are held to the same high standard every time they exercise their functions, so it is no excuse for a breach of trust that they have performed their duties better on other occasions. They are not assessed on their average performance.

However, it is possible to offset losses against profits where they arise from the same transaction or course of dealing.

This is well illustrated by [[Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Limited [1980] Ch 515]].

### Apportionment of Liability

As we have already seen, trustees are jointly and severally liable for breaches of trust. From the perspective of the beneficiaries, this means they can choose who to sue and can recover the full amount from any one of the trustees. From the perspective of the trustees, there is a further question, which is that of how the liability should be apportioned between them under the [Civil Liability Contribution Act 1978](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/47/contents).

If one trustee is sued for the full amount of the loss to the trust fund, they are likely to seek a contribution from their co-trustees.

A claim can be made under s 1(1) of the Act where two or more parties are liable for the same damage. The court has a discretion to require one party to make a ‘just and equitable’ contribution to another (s2 (1)), which means the contribution may not necessarily be equal between the trustees.

In rare cases, the court may even award a full indemnity (s2(2)). This is where the different duty of care for different trustees is most likely to come into play, with the court recognising that some trustees are more culpable than others.

It is rare for the court to award a full indemnity, as this effectively exempts a trustee from liability for a breach. In general, an indemnity will only be awarded where the indemnifying trustee has benefitted from the breach (including cases where they are also a beneficiary of the trust) or where a trustee is found to have been solely responsible for the duty that was breached.

As trusteeship is a joint office, an indemnity is very unlikely in practice but may happen where there is a significant disparity in the knowledge and experience of the trustees, resulting in one trustee taking full responsibility for a particular course of action. The most likely scenario where this will occur is where one trustee is a solicitor and another relies upon their advice as to the legality of a decision.

The application of this principle can be demonstrated by comparing two cases:

- In [[Re Partington (1887) 57 LT 654]] a full indemnity was awarded
- In contrast, no indemnity was awarded in [[Head v Gould [1989] 2 Ch 250, 272]], where the lay trustee took an active role in the breach of trust. Unlike in Partington, the solicitor trustee did not have a controlling influence over their co-trustee, so an indemnity was inappropriate.
