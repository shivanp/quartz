# Proprietary estoppel

## Introduction

Proprietary estoppel is an equitable doctrine which enables a person to informally acquire property (or personal) rights. Its objective is to prevent unconscionable conduct. It enables a court to do justice by modifying the parties’ strict legal rights. It is a very flexible doctrine.

Unlike promissory estoppel, proprietary estoppel is a cause of action: it is the basis of a claim. It is **not** limited to the status of a defence.

A successful proprietary estoppel claim gives rise to an ‘equity.’ The court determines how to ‘satisfy’ the equity, i.e., the court determines what remedy is appropriate. The court enjoys a broad discretion in selecting the remedy. It can satisfy the equity by awarding the claimant a personal right or a property right (including a right under a trust).

Proprietary estoppel claims are commonly encountered in two distinct factual situations (although they are not limited to these situations).

In the first situation, A mistakenly believes that they have a right in land which is owned by B and, in reliance on that belief, act to their detriment in circumstances where B is aware of their mistake but does not attempt to correct it or prevent them acting to their detriment. This situation is commonly described as an ‘acquiescence’ case.

In the second situation, B assures A that they have or will acquire a right in relation to B’s property and, in reliance on that assurance, B acts to their detriment. This situation is commonly described as an ‘assurance’ case.

This module only considers assurance cases.

In order to get a sense of proprietary estoppel, it is useful to begin with two examples from the case law.

- [[Pascoe v Turner [1979] 1 WLR 431]]
- [[Greasley v Cooke [1980] 1 WLR 1306]]

## Elements

In [[Thorner v Major [2009] UKHL 18]], the House of Lords identified the three main elements of a proprietary estoppel claim:

1. An assurance made to the claimant.
2. Reliance by the claimant on the assurance.
3. Detriment to the claimant in consequence of their reliance.

Moreover, as proprietary estoppel is based on ‘the fundamental principle that is equity is concerned to prevent unconscionable conduct,’ ([[Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch 210]]) the claimant must also demonstrate that it would be **unconscionable** for the defendant to resile from the assurance: [[Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd [2008] UKHL 55]]. This notion of ‘unconscionability’ unifies and confirms the other elements.

### Assurance

The first element of a proprietary estoppel claim is an assurance made by the defendant to the claimant.

The assurance must be an assurance (a promise) that the claimant has or will acquire a right in property owned by the defendant: [[Thorner v Major [2009] UKHL 18]]; [[Southwell v Blackburn [2014] EWCA Civ 1347]].

Thus, an assurance by the defendant that they will grant the claimant an easement over their land is a qualifying assurance. But an assurance by the defendant that the claimant will always be financially secure is not because it does not relate to any property owned by the defendant: [[Layton v Martin [1986] 2 FLR 227]].

Until relatively recently, it was not clear how certain an assurance is required to be for the purposes of proprietary estoppel. This issue was addressed and resolved by the House of Lords in *Thorner*.

The following features of the judgments are worth noting:

- The assurance need not be explicit. It can be inferred from indirect statements.
- The relevant assurance must be ‘clear enough’ and whether it is clear enough ‘is hugely dependent on context.’ (Lord Walker conceded that this is ‘a thoroughly question-begging formulation’.)
- The task of the court is to ascertain how the defendant’s words would have been reasonably understood by the claimant in the context in which they were spoken. Since David and Peter belonged to the same community of taciturn, undemonstrative men, ‘they were well able to understand one another.’

Lord Rodger neatly summarised the court’s approach:

> “it is sufficient if what Peter said was ‘clear enough.’ To whom? Perhaps not to an outsider. What matters, however, is that what Peter said should have been clear enough for David, whom he was addressing and who had years of experience in interpreting what he said and did, to form a reasonable view that Peter was giving him an assurance that he was to inherit the farm and that he could rely on it.”

### Reliance

The second element of a proprietary estoppel claim is reliance by the claimant on the defendant’s assurance. This means that there must be ‘a sufficient link’ between the defendant’s assurance and the claimant’s detrimental conduct: [[Wayling v Jones [1995] 2 FLR 1029]]; Gillett. This is effectively a causation requirement: [[Campbell v Griffin [2001] EWCA Civ 990]]. The assurance does not have to be the sole cause of the claimant’s detrimental conduct. It is sufficient if it is a cause of that conduct: Wayling.

The case law relating to reliance is not entirely consistent. Some cases have held that, if the claimant would have acted in the same way if the assurance had not been made, the proprietary estoppel claim fails on the reliance element. Other cases have held that this is not fatal to the claim.

[[Taylors Fashions Ltd v Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd [1982] QB 133]] (an acquiescence case) is an example of the former. The claimant argued that the installation of a lift in retail premises was an act of detrimental reliance. Oliver J rejected the argument (and the proprietary estoppel claim) on the basis that the claimant would have installed the lift anyway because, in view of its target customers (the elderly), its business had not been commercially viable in the absence of a lift.

In view of the tension between *Taylors* and *Wayling*, it is not possible to state the law relating to reliance with any great confidence or certainty.

There is one final point to note in relation to the reliance element. The effect of the presumption is to transfer the burden of proof (in relation to reliance) to the defendant. If the defendant makes an assurance to the claimant and the claimant acts in a manner which is detrimental, it is presumed that the claimant relied on the assurance: *Greasley*; *Wayling*. Where the presumption applies, the defendant must prove that the claimant did not rely on the assurance.

### Detriment

The third element of a proprietary estoppel claim is detriment to the claimant in consequence of their reliance on the defendant’s assurance. In [[Gillett v Holt [2001] Ch 210]], the Court of Appeal considered this element at length. Robert Walker LJ said that:

- detriment is not a narrow or technical concept
- detriment ‘must be approached as part of a broad inquiry as to whether repudiation of an assurance is or is not unconscionable in all the circumstances’
- countervailing benefits can be taken into account when assessing whether the claimant’s reliance was detrimental.

Robert Walker LJ also explained that the court must determine whether conduct is detrimental on the assumption that the defendant will dishonour the assurance.

```ad-example
Imagine that B assures A that B will give A a commercial farm and that, in reliance on that assurance, A does not make any provision for their pension because they believe that they will be given an income-yielding farm. On one view, A’s failure to make such provision is not detrimental: A has saved an expense. However, once it is assumed that B is going to dishonour the assurance, A’s failure to make such provision is clearly detrimental because A will be less well off in their old age.
```

The most obvious examples of detriment are expenditure (see Pascoe above) and the provision of services without payment or for less than their market value (see Greasley and Thorner above). However, detriment is not limited to expenditure, services or other quantifiable financial detriment. For example, in Gillett the court held that the claimant had acted to his detriment by subordinating himself to the defendant and allowing the defendant to make significant choices concerning the claimant and his family such as, for example, where and how the claimant’s children should be educated. A claimant also acts to their detriment if they pass up opportunities to better themselves or to live a better life, e.g., by choosing to not pursue educational, employment or business opportunities: Gillett; [[Henry v Henry [2010] UKPC 3]].

[[Southwell v Blackburn [2014] EWCA Civ 1347]] provides another interesting example of detriment.

### Unconscionability

Even in cases where the claimant establishes assurance, reliance and detriment, their claim will not succeed if the court considers that it would not be unconscionable for the defendant to dishonour the assurance: [[Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row Management Ltd [2008] UKHL 55]]; [[Southwell v Blackburn [2014] EWCA Civ 1347]].

This involves an ‘objective value judgment’ of the defendant’s behaviour by the court. The claim will only succeed if the defendant’s behaviour ‘shock[s] the conscience of the court:’ Cobbe.

As Tomlinson LJ said in Southwell:

> “There are undoubtedly cases where circumstances which would seem likely to give rise to an equity fail to do so when viewed in the light of the continuum of the relationship as evaluated at the point at which the promisor seeks to renege on his assurance.”

In effect, by dint of the ‘unconscionability’ requirement, the courts enjoy a residual discretion to dismiss a proprietary estoppel claim even if the claimant establishes assurance, reliance and detriment.

Many commentators are troubled by such an open-ended discretion.

However, it is only fair to observe that:.

- in nearly all the reported cases the presence of assurance, reliance and detriment has been sufficient to establish that it was unconscionable for the defendant to dishonour the assurance, and
- very few cases have failed on this basis.

In other words, the discretion is very sparingly exercised.

[[Sledmore v Dalby (1996) 72 P&CR 196]] is an example of a case where a claim did fail for want of unconscionability.

### Remedy

Where a claimant establishes a proprietary estoppel it generates an ‘equity’. The court must ‘satisfy’ the equity by fashioning an appropriate remedy. The overriding objective is to award a remedy that avoids an unconscionable result: [[Guest v Guest [2020] EWCA Civ 387]].

In fashioning the remedy, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including (of course) the claimant’s expectation and detriment: [[Jennings v Rice [2002] EWCA Civ 159]]; Guest.

The court has a broad and flexible (but not unfettered) discretion in fashioning the appropriate remedy: Guest. This is apparent from the range of remedies which have been awarded, which includes orders directing a defendant to:

- transfer ownership of property to the claimant
- hold property on trust for the claimant
- grant the claimant a property right over their property (e.g., an easement)
- grant the claimant a personal right over their property (e.g., a licence)
- pay a sum of money to the claimant.

Although the court enjoys a broad discretion in fashioning an appropriate remedy, the discretion is not unfettered. There are (at least) three principles which regulate the exercise of the discretion. These principles were (re)stated by the Court of Appeal in Jennings.

In *Jennings*, The Court of Appeal supported its judgment by reference to three principles which regulate the exercise of the remedial discretion in proprietary estoppel cases:

- The remedy should not exceed the claimant’s expectation. Since R had only assured the claimant that she would give him the house and its furniture, that was the maximum extent of any potential remedy. Thus, the judge was correct to reject the claimant’s argument that he was entitled to the whole of R’s estate.
- The court may award a remedy which satisfies the claimant’s expectations, but it is not required to do so (and in some cases it would be inappropriate to do so). As Aldous LJ said: ‘If the conscience of the court is involved, it would be odd that the amount of the award should be set rigidly at the sum expected by the claimant.’ Thus, the judge had not fallen into error when he rejected the claimant’s argument that he was entitled to the house and its furniture.
- The remedy must be proportionate to the claimant’s detriment. As Robert Walker LJ said:
> ‘The essence of the doctrine of proprietary estoppel is to do what is necessary to avoid an unconscionable result, and a disproportionate remedy cannot be the right way of going about that.’ He added that ‘the court must also do justice to the defendant.’ Thus, the judge had correctly rejected the claimant’s argument that he was entitled to the house and its furniture because such a remedy would have been disproportionate to the claimant’s detriment.

[[Pascoe v Turner [1979] 1 WLR 431]] is an interesting case in relation to remedy because it illustrates some of the (more unusual) factors which the court can consider.

In Pascoe, the court was of the view that the defendant’s equity could be satisfied in two ways: by giving her a licence to occupy the house for the rest of her life or by giving the house to her. The court choose the latter option. In doing so, it was particularly influenced by the following factors:

- The claimant was rich compared to the defendant and the defendant had spent approximately 70% of her savings repairing, improving and furnishing the house.
- The claimant had demonstrated a ‘ruthless’ streak in his efforts to exclude the defendant from the house. And it was important to protect the defendant from future manifestations of his ruthlessness. In particular, the court was concerned that, if it gave the defendant a licence, the claimant would invent excuses for entering the house and interfering with her enjoyment with a view to driving her out. The court was also concerned that he would sell the house with a view to destroying the defendant’s rights. (A licensee cannot enforce a licence against a purchaser from the licensor.)

## Proprietary Estoppel and Constructive Trusts

In the 1990s, there was a concerted effort by some commentators and judges to assimilate proprietary estoppel and common intention constructive trusts. Robert Walker LJ was the leading judicial advocate of this project: see, for example, [[Yaxley v Gotts [2000] Ch 162]]. However, on his elevation to the House of Lords, Lord Walker recanted and in [[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17]] he identified the principal conceptual distinction between proprietary estoppel and common intention constructive trusts:

> “Proprietary estoppel typically consists of asserting an equitable claim against the conscience of the “true” owner. The claim is a “mere equity.” It is to be satisfied by the minimum award necessary to do justice […] which may sometimes lead to no more than a monetary award. A “common intention” constructive trust, by contrast, is identifying the true beneficial owner or owners, and the size of their beneficial interests.”

Although the assimilation project still has its advocates, it has lost much of its force and has very little judicial support.

```ad-summary
- Proprietary estoppel is an equitable doctrine by which a claimant can informally acquire property (or personal) rights
- In ‘assurance’ cases, the claimant must prove assurance, reliance, detriment and unconscionability
- The assurance must relate to a right in or over identified property
- Detriment is not a narrow concept and it includes expenditure, the provision of services and many other types of conduct
- Reliance is a causal connection between the assurance and the detriment
- A proprietary estoppel claim is only available if the defendant’s conduct is unconscionable and shocks the conscience of the court
- The court has a broad discretion to fashion a remedy
- The remedy should be fashioned so as to avoid an unconscionable result
