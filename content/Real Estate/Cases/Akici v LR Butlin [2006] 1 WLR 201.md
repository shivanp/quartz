# Akici v LR Butlin [2006] 1 WLR 201

## Ummary

In the absence of special circumstances, a breach of covenant against parting with possession or sharing possession, falling short of creating or transferring a legal interest, was capable of remedy within the meaning of the Law of Property Act 1925 s.146.

## Abstract

The appellant (H) appealed against a decision that H's landlord (B) had validly forfeited his lease of business premises and that H should be refused relief from forfeiture. The lease had been assigned to H. The lease contained comprehensive provisions relating to alienation that prohibited assigning, underletting, sharing or parting with possession. A company (D) had gone into occupation of the premises and traded from them selling takeaway pizzas. B had served a notice pursuant to the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.146](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3970E850E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default)) alleging that H had assigned, sublet or parted with possession to D. H had initially claimed that he was the owner and sole director of D when he was not. The shares in D were later transferred to him and he became the sole director. Soon afterwards B re entered the premises and changed the locks. The judge had held that, although there had been no parting with possession, H had been sharing possession with D in breach of covenant because sharing possession meant sharing occupation, and that B could rely on that breach even though it had not been mentioned in the s.146 notice. H argued that the judge had been wrong to hold that

(1) the prohibition against sharing possession could be construed as referring to sharing occupation;

(2) B could rely on that breach despite the fact that it was not mentioned in the s.146 notice;

(3) that breach was incapable of remedy;

(4) relief from forfeiture should be refused.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the covenant in the lease against parting with possession of the whole or part of the premises should be given its normal and technically legally correct meaning, _[Lam Kee Ying Sdn Bhd v Lam Shes Tong (t/a Lian Joo Co) [1975] A.C. 247, [1974] 7 WLUK 50](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6A1DB00E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The covenant against sharing possession should be construed in the same way. That would not deprive the covenant against sharing possession of any useful effect. Therefore the judge had been wrong to construe the covenant against sharing possession as extending to sharing occupation, _[Jackson v Simons [1923] 1 Ch. 373, [1922] 12 WLUK 138](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICB946B10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered and _[Tulapam Properties v De Almeida (1981) 260 E.G. 919, [1981] 1 WLUK 414](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA5C307C0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled. The judge had been entitled to hold that in the circumstances there had been no parting with possession even though the takeaway pizza business had been operated by D. On the facts found by the judge he would have been entitled to conclude that H had been sharing possession with D in breach of covenant.

(2) The s.146 notice did not refer to sharing possession and consequently did not specify the particular breach complained of, as required by that section. Although the notice had to be construed in the light of the preceding correspondence, that correspondence did not take matters any further. Therefore the s.146 notice was ineffective to support B's re entry.

(3) In the absence of special circumstances, a breach of covenant against parting with possession or sharing possession, falling short of creating or transferring a legal interest, was capable of remedy within the meaning of s.146, _[Expert Clothing Service & Sales Ltd v Hillgate House Ltd [1986] Ch. 340, [1985] 3 WLUK 27](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA4DEC010E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Savva v Hussein (1997) 73 P. & C.R. 150, [1996] 4 WLUK 230](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I98405A70E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered, and _[Scala House & District Property Co v Forbes [1974] Q.B. 575, [1973] 5 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I985FC950E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. The judge had been entitled to conclude that the breach had been remedied by H acquiring the shares in and becoming the sole director of D, _[Rainham Chemical Works Ltd (In Liquidation) v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd [1921] 2 A.C. 465, [1921] 7 WLUK 211](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I80482F10E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c003f4c17af9460aa6066fcbaa59ee94&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.

(4) If the re entry had been valid the judge's decision to refuse relief from forfeiture would have been justified.
