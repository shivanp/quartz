# Mortgage Services Funding plc v Steele (1996) 72 P&CR 40

S fell into arrears on his mortgage of GBP 207,546 advanced by M. M obtained an order for possession when the arrears had reached GBP 24,000. S was in receipt of housing benefit and there was a shortfall on the payments of over GBP 1,000 per month. The judge granted the order on the grounds that S would not be able to pay the arrears within a reasonable period. S applied for leave to appeal, informing the appeal court that he had found a buyer for his property at a sale price of GBP 310,000. No details were provided of the sale, other than the fact that S had instructed a licensed conveyancer to act on his behalf.

Held, dismissing the application, that unless there is firm evidence that a particular sale is about to be completed, it is not the practice of the court to prevent the mortgagee from enforcing his remedy of obtaining possession and exercising his own power of sale over the property.
