# Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages v Bell [2001] 2 FLR 809

## Summary

BIHM, who had advanced a mortgage to B on security of which her home, appealed against an order allowing B's appeal against an order for possession. The charge had been held to operate on an equitable basis only because of doubts as to the validity of B's signature. BIHM contended that (1) the judge should have found as a fact that B had signed the documents, and (2) a sale of the property should have been ordered. It was held that (1) on the overall evidence, it was impossible to say that the judge had erred in his findings of fact, and (2) the judge had erred in the exercise of his discretion in refusing to order a sale since he had failed to take into account highly material considerations, including the lack of equity in the property and the injustice to BIHM resulting from postponement of the sale.

## Abstract

BI, a bank and mortgagee of a property co-owned by B and her former husband, appealed against an order allowing B's appeal against an order for possession. The judge had ordered rectification of the charges register in order to delete the charge on the property in favour of BI, and held that the charge was to operate on an equitable basis only over the property because of doubts as to the validity of B's signature on the mortgage documents. BI contended that (1) the judge should have found as a fact that B had signed the relevant documents, and (2) a sale of the property should have been ordered.

Held, allowing the appeal in part and substituting an order for sale, that (1) on the overall evidence, it was impossible to say that the judge had erred in his findings of fact, and (2) the judge had erred in the exercise of his discretion by refusing to order the sale of the property pursuant to the [Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 s.14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I226821D0E44F11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7db025ea96d847b8b224174fc3f8427e&contextData=(sc.Default)) as he had failed to take into account certain material considerations referred to in s.15. The judge had not taken into account the fact that BI would take all the proceeds on the sale of the property given B's minimal beneficial interest or the subsequent injustice to BI resulting from an indefinite postponement of any sale. Neither had the judge drawn accurate conclusions with regard to occupation of the property or the intention concerning its use at the time of purchase.
