# Green v Ashco Horticultural Ltd [1966] 1 WLR 889

**FACTS:** The claimant claimed a right to park a van on the defendantâ€™s land was an easement. The claimant had always moved his van if asked to do so by the servient owner.

**HELD:** The defendant was only exercising the right to park in so far as the servient owner permitted. In moving the van on request, the defendant was actually acknowledging that he did not park on the land as of right but by permission.

An intermittent consensual privilege to use a way over a landlord's adjacent land is not user which can be the subject of a legal right and so be capable of conversion into a legal easement by the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.62](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38E0B640E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4e4a8bee7eea4b8f92d56aee85546732&contextData=(sc.Default)). B leased shop premises to G, first in 1931 for 14 years, secondly in 1945 for 14 years and thirdly in 1959 for 21 years. B occupied the adjoining premises. A passageway led from the street to and past a courtyard on B's retained land at the back of G's shop. At any rate until 1960 there were wooden doors across the entrance to the passageway and these were often kept closed out of business hours so that G had to ask an employee of the landlord to open them. G made considerable use of the passageway to get goods to his shop. B sold the freehold of G's premises and the adjoining land to the defendants. G claimed a right of way over the courtyard and the passageway.

Held, the claims failed.
