# Pink v Lawrence [1978] 36 P&CR

The doctrine of constructive trusts cannot apply to a transaction where there is an express declaration of trust. A house was conveyed to the plaintiff and defendant as joint tenants in law and in equity. The plaintiff subsequently claimed that the defendant had only been joined on the transfer to satisfy mortgagees, he having contributed nothing towards the price and that, accordingly, the property was held on constructive trust for the benefit of the plaintiff alone. The plaintiff sought an order that the defendant transfer all his interest in the property. The defendant claimed an interest in the property on the grounds that he had paid GBP 500 towards the price. The Master ruled that the defendant could not establish an interest unless he proved not only that he had paid GBP 500, but that such sum was paid towards the purchase price.

Held, allowing the defendants' appeal, that in the absence of recision by reason of fraud or mistake or of a claim to rectify the transfer, the express declaration of trust contained in the transfer precluded the implication of a constructive trust.
