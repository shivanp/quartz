# Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131

**FACTS:** Land around Ellenborough Park was developed for housing. The conveyances of the individual plots included the following right:

> ‘… full enjoyment at all times… of the pleasure ground set out and made in front of the said plot of land… in the centre of the square called Ellenborough Park.’

During the Second World War, the park was requisitioned, and the War Office paid compensation for the loss of the land. The question was whether the owners of the plots and their successors had a legal easement to use the park. If they did, then when the park was requisitioned, they had lost a legal right for which compensation should be paid.

**HELD:** Evershed MR said that to be an enforceable legal easement, the right must have the characteristics of an easement.

## **Facts:**

In Re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131, Elenborough Park and the surrounding property was an open and unbuilt-on piece of land. Furthermore, the owners of the land sold some of the plots surrounding the park to property developers. Moreover, they included in the conveyance the right to enjoy the park subject to the payment of a fair and just proportion of the costs to maintain the park.

Many years later, after the developed plots had been sold, the case came before the courts questioning whether the purchasers of those plots of land (and their successors) had any enforceable rights to use Ellenborough Park. Furthermore, this included in the conveyances, the right to enjoy the Ellenborough Park subject to maintenance payments.

## **Held:**

In conclusion, the Court of Appeal held that the purchasers of the plots had easements over the collective garden. The right to use Ellenborough Park as a private pleasure ground is a recognised easement in law.

The real importance of the case is that Evershed MR laid out the _four criteria_ or the _four characteristics_ that constitute an easement.

## **Four Criteria:**

1. Firstly, there must be a dominant and a servient tenement
2. The easement must accommodate the dominant land
3. The easement must be owned or occupied by different people
4. ‘An easement must be capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant’
