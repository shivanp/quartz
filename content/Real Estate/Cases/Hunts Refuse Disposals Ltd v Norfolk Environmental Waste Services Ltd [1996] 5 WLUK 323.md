# Hunts Refuse Disposals Ltd v Norfolk Environmental Waste Services Ltd [1996] 5 WLUK 323

N appealed against a judgment in relation to the interpretation of deeds which were held to have granted a licence of the relevant land. N argued that it had been granted a tenancy with a limited user provision.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) the judge was entitled to find that N did not have exclusive possession and that the agreement was not a tenancy, _[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=862f89c7055f4569a68e8799279bd209&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed and

(2) clause 1 of the agreement provided N with a licence to enter and use the land for the purpose of waste disposal. Those limited rights did not grant exclusive possession, _[Addiscombe Garden Estates v Crabbe [1958] 1 Q.B. 513, [1957] 11 WLUK 53](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I53326500E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=862f89c7055f4569a68e8799279bd209&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. N argued that the other clauses, stating, inter alia, how the agreement could be determined, were consistent with a tenancy. The clauses, however, were ambiguous and showed that the agreement was capable of being construed as either a tenancy or a licence and none of those clauses were strong enough to displace the indication of a licence in cl.1.
