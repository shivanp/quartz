# Diligent Finance Co Ltd v Alleyne (1972) 23 P & CR 346 2

**FACTS:** A Class F land charge was registered against Erskine Alleyne. His full name, as appearing in the title deeds, was Erskine Owen Alleyne.

**HELD:** A clear search against the full name allowed a later mortgagee to take free from the spouseâ€™s right of occupation as the Class F land charge was void.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary the court should assume that the proper name of a person is that in which the conveyancing documents have been taken. A mortgaged a certain freehold property in 1965, and then again to the plaintiffs in 1968, both charges being registered with A's name as Erskine Owen Alleyne. In 1969 A's deserted wife registered a Class F land charge against A as Erskine Alleyne only. In 1970 A remortgaged the property to the plaintiffs for a large loan. An official search revealed only the first mortgage, as did the official certificate. A left the country and the plaintiffs sought possession of the property.

Held, that the court, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, could assume A's proper name to be that in which the conveyancing documents had been taken, the Class F registration had been made against the wrong name, the official certificate was conclusive, and the Class F charge did not rank ahead of the legal charge to the plaintiffs.
