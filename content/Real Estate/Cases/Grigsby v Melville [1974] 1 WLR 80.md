# Grigsby v Melville [1974] 1 WLR 80

Facts: Access to the cellar was from the defendant's house. The cellar was under the claimant’s house but could not be accessed from there.

Held: The Court of Appeal held that the cellar was owned by the claimant, and based their reasoning partly on the fundamental principle that a conveyance of land ordinarily carries with it all that is beneath the surface.

## Summary

If a vendor wishes to except some part of the property from parcels which are clearly described in a conveyance, he must use language which is apt for the purpose.

## Abstract

A butcher owned two adjoining properties, A and B. He used A as a residence and B as a shop. A and B had separate entrances but had connecting doors on the ground and upper floors. Beneath A there was a cellar which was not accessible from A, but only from B, through an interior door, and down some steps. The cellar was used for the purposes of the butcher's business in B. A and B came into the hands of the vendor, who decided to sell them separately. He bricked up all connecting doors, except for the cellar door, and conveyed to X, property A, being "all that dwelling house and premises … delineated on the plan annexed" at ground level. He conveyed B to Y. X sought an injunction restraining Y from entering the cellar. Y claimed that the cellar was part of B as opposed to A, and thus excepted from the conveyance.

Held, that in the absence of anything to the contrary the conveyance included the whole substratum of the property to the centre of the earth, and the circumstances surrounding the transaction were not admissible to contradict the plain language of the conveyance (_[Mitchell v Mosley [1914] 1 Ch. 438, [1913] 10 WLUK 35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFBAC1FF0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6ae5d0b342ab4df7bd55e3ebf526c60a&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
