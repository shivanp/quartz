# Renals v Cowlishaw (1878) 9 ChD 125

The fee simple owners sold part of its residential estate and adjoining lands to the defendants' predecessors in title, who agreed with the owners restricting their right to build on and use the land. The owners later sold the estate to the plaintiffs' predecessors in title. The conveyance had no reference to the restrictive covenants, and no representation was made that the purchasers were to have the benefit of the covenants. The plaintiffs claimed an injunction restraining the defendants, who purchased the land with notice of the covenants, from building on and using the land in breach of the covenants.

The Chancery Division held that to enable a purchaser as an assign to claim the benefit of a restrictive covenant, it should appear that he acquired the property with the benefit of the covenant. That meant that the benefit of the covenant was part of the subject-matter of the purchase. Thus, in the instant case, the plaintiffs were not entitled to the benefit of the covenants.
