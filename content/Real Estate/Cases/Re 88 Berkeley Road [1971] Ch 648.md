# Re 88 Berkeley Road [1971] Ch 648

**FACTS:** Miss Elridge and Miss Goodwin owned 88 Berkeley Road as beneficial joint tenants. Miss Goodwin was a friend of Miss Elridge’s mother. All three had lived together, and Miss Elridge and Miss Goodwin continued to do so after the mother’s death. When Miss Elridge announced she was shortly to be married, Miss Goodwin, who was a generation older and likely to die first, decided to sever the beneficial joint tenancy. Miss Goodwin’s solicitors sent a notice of severance by recorded delivery to the property. When it was delivered, Miss Elridge had gone to work and Miss Goodwin herself signed for the letter. Miss Elridge, or Mrs Rickwood as she became, knew nothing about the notice until she found a draft of it amongst Miss Goodwin’s papers after her death. Mrs Rickwood applied for a declaration that the notice was of no effect and that she was entitled to the property by survivorship as she had not been ‘given’ notice in accordance with **s 36(2).**

**HELD:** The court said that there was no distinction between ‘giving’ and ‘serving’ notice. Although Mrs Rickman was not physically given the notice of severance, it was effectively served under **LPA 1925, s 196(4)** by registered post as it had been signed for and had not been returned undelivered.

A notice of severance is properly served if sent by post, even if it is not received by the addressee. R and G lived together in a house which was held by them as legal and beneficial joint tenants. G instructed her solicitors to serve notice of severance on R, which they did by sending her a notice in a recorded delivery letter addressed to her at the house. This was delivered by the postman after R had gone to work, and was taken in and signed for by G, and R never received it. On the question of whether the notice had been "given" to R as required by the [Law of Property Act 1925s.36 (2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60CA4D31E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=378e629dc1e3438db8b135065a44f3eb&contextData=(sc.Default)) , R argued that s. 196 (4) (which made the posting sufficient evidence of service) was not applicable, as that subsection related only to notices required to be "served," and not to notices required to be "given.".

Held,

(1) that in relation to written notices there was no difference between "served" and "given";

(2) the fact that R had never received the notice was not sufficient to rebut the conclusive presumption provided by proof of posting. ( _[R. v Westminster Unions Assessment Committee Ex p.
