# Firstpost Homes Ltd v Johnson [1995] 4 All E.R. 355

F orally agreed to purchase land from J. F prepared a letter bearing J's name as addressee, and setting out the agreement to purchase the land "shown on the enclosed plan". J signed the accompanying plan only, F signed both the plan and the letter. J died and F sought specific performance of the contract against J's personal representatives. The personal representatives sought to strike out the claim because there was no contract satisfying the requirements of writing under the [Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s.2](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/IA99A6900E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2c0d86e43c90451db4fa911f214bd85b&contextData=(sc.Default)) , which required written terms, in one document, signed by or on behalf of each party. The district judge dismissed the application on the basis that it was arguable that the letter and plan were one document, the judge overruled this and F appealed, further contending that if there were two documents, the purchaser had signed the letter by causing his name to be typed on it as addressee.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that (1) for the purposes of s.2 of the 1989 Act, a letter and a plan enclosed with it were separate documents; the letter contained the terms and so was the document which needed to be signed; (2) the same section required each party to write his name on the document in his own handwriting, so that the typing of J's name was not sufficient.
