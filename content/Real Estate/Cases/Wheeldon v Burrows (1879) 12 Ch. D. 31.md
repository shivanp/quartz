# Wheeldon v Burrows (1879) 12 Ch. D. 31

On a grant of part of a tenement, or of one of two adjoining tenements belonging to the same grantor, the Court of Appeal, Civil Division held that no reservation of easements would be implied in favour of a grantor, except easements of necessity; but there would pass by implication to a grantee all continuous apparent easements, as were necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the property granted, and were in fact enjoyed during the unity of ownership. If the grantor intended to reserve any right over the tenement granted, it was his duty to reserve it expressly in the grant.
