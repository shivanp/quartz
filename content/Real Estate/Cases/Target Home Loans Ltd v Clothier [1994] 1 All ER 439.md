# Target Home Loans Ltd v Clothier [1994] 1 All ER 439

Where the prospect of an early sale by the mortgagors served the interests of both themselves and the mortgagees an opportunity should be given for that to be achieved. A and B took a mortgage out on their home to secure a loan of GBP 225,000. From July 1990 no payments on the mortgage were made and the mortgagees sought an order for possession. At trial, A and B were able to offer GBP 10,000 and another GBP 48,000 to be realised on a future sale of land towards the arrears of GBP 64,579. The judge adjourned the application for four months. The mortgagees appealed to the Court of Appeal. At the hearing A produced a letter from a firm of estate agents who expressed the view that the whole property would shortly be sold and that an initial offer of GBP 450,000 had been received.

Held, allowing the mortgagee's appeal that

(1) there was no evidence of A and B being likely to discharge the sums due under the mortgage within a reasonable time;

(2) since the prospects of an early sale were best served by allowing A and B to remain in occupation of the house the order for possession would be deferred for three months (_[Royal Trust Co of Canada v Markham [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1416, [1975] 7 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9082FFE0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=96b2d8899d6c4ca9a7466f531da8a632&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
