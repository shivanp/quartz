# Noakes & Co Ltd v Rice [1902] AC 24

FACTS: The borrower mortgaged his leasehold pub to a brewery. The pub was a freehouse, meaning that beers from any brewery could be sold there. The mortgage included a solus tie requiring the borrower to sell only beer brewed by the lender. This tie was to last for the lease term, even if the loan had been repaid.

HELD: The solus tie was void as it exceeded the mortgage term. The borrower would not get back what he had mortgaged, because at the end of the term what had been a freehouse would be a pub still subject to the solus tie.
