# Ellison v Reacher [1908] 2 Ch 374

The trustees of a building society conveyed an estate to the defendants' predecessors in title subject to a covenant to observe restrictions to the effect that 'on no lot should any hotel, tavern, public-house or beer-house be built, or any house used as such, or any manufacture be carried on, without the consent of the vendors, their heirs and assigns'. Other lots were conveyed to the plaintiffs' predecessor in title. The defendants used the building on the lots as a hotel. The plaintiffs sought an injunction restraining the defendants from using the building as a hotel. The defendants contend that the injunction should not be granted as substantial damage was not proved. The Chancery Division held that in Richards v Revitt, the absence of proof of substantial damages was not by itself sufficient to warrant the denial of a claim for an injunction. Thus, the injunction would be granted.
