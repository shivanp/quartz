# Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Green [1981] AC 513 1

**FACTS:** In 1961 a tenant farmer (Geoffrey Green) was granted an option by his father (Walter) to purchase an unregistered farm in Lincolnshire. The son did not protect the option by Land Charge. Six years later the father, intending to deprive his son of the option, sold the land to his wife (Evelyne) for £500. The farm had a market value of £40,000. On discovering the sale to his mother, the son attempted to exercise the option. Both the son and the mother had died before the case reached the House of Lords, who had to consider whether the option was binding on the mother’s estate. At first instance, the court found in favour of the mother’s estate; that decision was reversed on appeal to the Court of Appeal.

**HELD:** Entry onto the register, or failure to do so, is conclusive as to notice, regardless of any knowledge the purchaser may have of any rights existing over the land. It did not matter that the consideration was nominal, the mother was still a 'purchaser' and she was not therefore bound by the option, which should have been protected by a Class C (iv) Land Charge.

In 1961, for the consideration of GBP 1, W granted G the option to buy a farm. This was an estate contract and so a legal charge, Class C, registrable under the Land Charges Act 1925 but G did not register it. In 1967, when the farm was worth GBP 40,000, W conveyed it to his wife E for GBP 500. A month later G registered the option as an estate contract, and a month after that he gave notice exercising the option. In 1970 G issued a writ stating that the option was still binding, and claiming specific performance. He failed at first instance, the judge holding that the sale to E had been a genuine sale by a vendor to a purchaser, as defined by the [Land Charges Act 1925 s.13(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2C35A020CEE611E5BE749B14DADC75EB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7801e49fd3d1404bb081926dc5f4146c&contextData=(sc.Default)) for money or money's worth, and that the option was therefore not specifically enforceable. G appealed successfully. E's estate appealed to the House of Lords, where G contended that such a transaction had to be in good faith, and that the consideration given had to be more than nominal, in order to override an unregistered Class C interest.

Held, allowing the appeal,

(1) there was no requirement in s.13(3) that the purchaser should be in good faith;

(2) the word "purchaser" in s.13(2), by definition, meant one who had provided valuable consideration; a term of art which precluded any inquiry into adequacy. There was no clause in the Land Charges Act 1925 equivalent to s.205(1)(xxi). To exclude a nominal sum of money from s.13(2) would be to rewrite the section, _[Monolithic Building Co, Re [1915] 1 Ch. 643, [1915] 2 WLUK 92](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I048BDA70E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7801e49fd3d1404bb081926dc5f4146c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
