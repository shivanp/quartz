# LCC v Allen [1914] 3 KB 642.

**FACTS**: Mr Allen bought land from LCC and covenanted not to build on it. He sold the land to his wife who started to build. LCC tried to enforce the covenant against her.

**HELD:** the court refused to enforce the covenant as LCC had retained no land capable of being benefitted when it sold the land to Mr Allen.
