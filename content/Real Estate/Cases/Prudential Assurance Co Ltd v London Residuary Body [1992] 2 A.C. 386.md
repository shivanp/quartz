# Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body [1992] 2 A.C. 386

FACTS: A piece of land was sold to the Greater London Council. It was leased back to the seller on a lease which was to continue until the land was required by the council for road widening purposes. On the abolition of the Greater London Council, the freehold reversion passed to the London Residuary Body (LRB).

The LRB had no authority to create roads but served six months’ notice bringing the 'lease' to an end.

HELD: The House of Lords held that the arrangement was for an uncertain period at the outset and was therefore not a lease. The court did, however, say that the land was held under a yearly periodic tenancy that had arisen by virtue of the tenant’s possession and payment of rent by reference to a year.
