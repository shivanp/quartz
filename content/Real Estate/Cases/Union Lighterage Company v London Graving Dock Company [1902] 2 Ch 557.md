# Union Lighterage Company v London Graving Dock Company [1902] 2 Ch 557

The owners owned both the dock and the wharf, which were divided by a fence. In order to secure the dock, the owners carried a number of tie-rods underground beneath the fence. The owners then conveyed the wharf to the plaintiff without any express reservation of a right of support for the dock. Later, the owners conveyed the dock to the defendant. The plaintiff became aware of the tie-rods when it made some excavations in the wharf. The plaintiff filed an action that it was entitled to remove the tie-rods or the support to the dock. The Court of Appeal held that the easement of support was not one of necessity. In the instant case, when the wharf was conveyed to the plaintiff, there was no implied reservation of a right of support to the dock. The tie-rods did not remain vested in the grantors as part of or appurtenant to the dock. Thus, the plaintiff was entitled to remove the tie-rods as the defendant did not acquire an easement of support by its length of enjoyment.
