# Van Haarlam v Kasner [1992] 64 P & CR 214

A double demand for and acceptance of rent in the knowledge that a tenant had been arrested, charged with offences under the [Official Secrets Act 1920](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60D12B00E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=39ba35aef0ae425cb2f0673849071db0&contextData=(sc.Default)) and remanded in custody, amounted to a waiver, prior to service of the s.146 notice, of the right to forfeit. A 99-year lease from July 1983 of a flat was granted in consideration of a premium of GBP 36,695 and contained covenants against illegal or immoral user and for use only as a private dwelling for one family, together with provision for re-entry in the event of arrears of rent or breach of covenant. In April 1988 T was arrested and charged with offences under the Official Secrets Act 1920 for which he was eventually convicted and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment in March 1989, having in the meantime been remanded in custody. Meanwhile demands were sent for the ground rent for the periods June to December 1988 and December 1988 to June 1989; and the ground rent was duly offered and accepted. On December 8, 1989 a letter was posted through the door of the flat stating that T had been guilty of irremediable breaches of the covenant against illegal user; and on December 21, 1989 L effected a re-entry.

Held, giving judgment for T, that

(1) T's conduct represented a serious and irremediable breach of covenant (_[Hoffmann v Fineberg [1949] Ch. 245, [1948] 3 WLUK 27](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC1969661E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=39ba35aef0ae425cb2f0673849071db0&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Governors of Rugby School v Tannahill [1935] 1 K.B. 87, [1934] 10 WLUK 34](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB2FD67A1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=39ba35aef0ae425cb2f0673849071db0&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Scala House & District Property Co v Forbes [1974] Q.B. 575, [1973] 5 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I985FC950E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=39ba35aef0ae425cb2f0673849071db0&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Expert Clothing Service & Sales Ltd v Hillgate House Ltd [1986] Ch. 340, [1985] 3 WLUK 27](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA4DEC010E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=39ba35aef0ae425cb2f0673849071db0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered);

(2) the letter of December 8, 1989 was a valid notice under s.146 of the Law of Property Act 1925, notwithstanding that it did not refer to that section, and had been properly served pursuant to s.196 of the Act;

(3) however, the double demand and acceptance of rent in the knowledge that T had been arrested, charged with offences under the Official Secrets Act 1920 and remanded in custody, amounted to a waiver prior to service of the s.146 notice of the right to forfeit (_[Chrisdell Ltd v Johnson (1987) 19 H.L.R. 406, [1987] 5 WLUK 14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I86F71C50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=39ba35aef0ae425cb2f0673849071db0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished);

(4) had it been relevant for the matter to be considered, relief against forfeiture would have been granted.
