# Aslan v Murphy [1990] 1 WLR 766

## Abstract

The touchstone of whether an occupation agreement confers the status of tenant or licensee is the question of exclusive or non-exclusive possession but the court must look to the true nature of the bargain between the parties. In three separate appeals decided by a single judgment, a common question arose as to whether respective occupation agreements gave rise to tenancies or licences. In the first case A was the occupier of a basement room pursuant to an agreement which purported to give him non-exclusive occupation save between 10.30 a.m. and noon each day, during which time he was purportedly not entitled to occupy at all. The judge found that this agreement created a licence and ordered possession. Subsequently the local authority served a closing order on R in respect of the room; and R contended that the consequent effect of the [Housing Act 1985 s.276 and s.277](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA2B3DBE0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=436d492118f04f7087409a75d690d1ab&contextData=(sc.Default)) was to create an automatic right to possession. The assistant recorder accepted this argument, and granted R a further possession order. In the third case the accommodation comprised a house occupied under an agreement which purported to grant a non-exclusive right to occupation as licensees, and emphasised that the owner would wish to obtain vacant possession at very short notice. In due course the owner wished to emigrate and sell with vacant possession, and the judge ordered possession.

Held, allowing the appeals, that

(1) in the first case the purported exclusion of the right to occupy for 90 minutes of every day was plainly a pretence, and that the agreement created a tenancy;

(2) that in the second case neither s.276 nor s.277 automatically created a right to possession: it remained for the contractual tenancy to be determined, which had not occurred;

(3) that in the third case the true bargain was that the occupiers should be entitled to exclusive occupation unless and until the owner wanted to exercise her right to authorise someone else to move in as lodger, and that she had never suggested that this was a serious possibility; accordingly the agreement created a tenancy. The Court of Appeal emphasised that the question of whether an agreement creates a tenancy or licence depends upon the true bargain in each case; that labels are never conclusive; that the touchstone is whether occupation is exclusive or non-exclusive; that the court must keep a weather eye open for pretences pointing to the conclusion that the terms of the true bargain are not wholly the same as those of the bargain appearing on the face of the agreement; and that an occupier who would otherwise be protected by the Rent Acts does not lose that protection by agreeing, whether directly or indirectly, to surrender it, whether immediately or in the future (_[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=436d492118f04f7087409a75d690d1ab&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered; _[Antoniades v Villiers [1988] 3 W.L.R. 139, [1988] 3 WLUK 231](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5E985530E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=436d492118f04f7087409a75d690d1ab&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
