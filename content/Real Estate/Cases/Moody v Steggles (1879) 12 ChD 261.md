# Moody v Steggles (1879) 12 ChD 261

**Facts:** The claimant claimed a right to hang a sign on an adjoining building which pointed down a side-street to the claimantâ€™s pub was an easement.

**Held:** the sign benefitted a long-established business which had become the normal use of that land. Therefore the right which benefitted the business also benefitted the land itself.
