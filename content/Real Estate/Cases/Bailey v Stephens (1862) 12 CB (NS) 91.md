# Bailey v Stephens (1862) 12 CB (NS) 91

The English Court held that a claim of a prescriptive right by the occupiers of an estate to enter another estate belonging to a third person, and to cut down, carry away and convert to their own use all the trees and wood growing thereon, 'as to first estate appertaining' was considered void for being too large.

It was considered as a profit a prendre, in which a man might have an inheritable estate. It was connected with the enjoyment of the dominant tenement. There was really no more connection than if the owner of the first estate was to be granted a right of way to the owner of another estate because an incident of that nature could not, even by express words in an existing deed, be connected with the estate by the mere act of the parties. There should be some natural connection that should inhere in the estate. Thus, if an express grant to that effect was produced between the grantee and the grantor and going as between their heirs, it could not run with the estate.
