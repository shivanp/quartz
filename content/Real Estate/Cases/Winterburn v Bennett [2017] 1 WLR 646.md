# Winterburn v Bennett [2017] 1 WLR 646

FACTS: Customers and delivery drivers to a fish and chip shop used a car park on the adjoining land which belonged to the local Conservative Club. The Conservative Club had erected a sign, and replaced it over time. The sign said that the car park was private and for the use of club patrons only.

HELD: A claim for a parking easement by prescription was rejected. The use of the car park was not ‘as of right’, it had been used by force.
