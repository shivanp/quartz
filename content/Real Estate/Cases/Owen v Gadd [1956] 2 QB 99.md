# Owen v Gadd [1956] 2 QB 99

It is not necessary in order to constitute a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment that there should be an actual physical irruption into or upon the premises demised on the part of the landlord or some person authorised by him, albeit the disturbance must be of a direct and physical character. A lease of shop premises granted by the defendants to the plaintiff contained a covenant for quiet enjoyment in the usual terms. The defendants retained premises above those demised, and contractors instructed by them erected scaffolding immediately in front of the shop window and door of the demised premises for the purpose of carrying out repairs to the landlords' premises. The plaintiff complained of consequential loss of trade, and claimed damages for breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. The county court judge held as a fact that the interference with the plaintiff's enjoyment of his premises was substantial. The defendants appealed.

Held, there was no principle of law which disqualified the judge from holding as he did, and the appeal must be dismissed.
