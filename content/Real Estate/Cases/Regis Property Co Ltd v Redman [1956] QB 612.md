# Regis Property Co Ltd v Redman [1956] QB 612

## Abstract

There is a transfer of a burden or liability within the meaning of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920 s.2(3) whenever a given letting places on the tenant a burden or liability which rested on the landlord under the terms of the tenancy by reference to which the standard rent was fixed, or conversely places on the landlord a burden or liability which rested on the tenant under those terms. On the true construction of the subsection, the expressions "previously borne by the landlord" and "previously borne by the tenant" mean borne by the landlord or tenant (as the case may be) under the terms of the letting by reference to which the standard rent was fixed, and the expression "the previous terms" means the terms of that letting, notwithstanding the terms of any letting or lettings there may have been between the letting by reference to which the standard rent was fixed and the letting immediately in question. The dwelling-house, a flat, to which the Rent Acts applied, was first let to S on April 8, 1936, at a rent of GBP 115. Under that agreement S undertook the obligation to repair the exterior of the flat and to do repairs attributable to fair wear and tear. At that time the flat stood in the current valuation list at the rateable value of GBP 41, but in March, 1941, the list was amended retrospectively as from April 1, 1935, and the rateable value was reduced to GBP 34. On November 26, 1943, the flat was let to C, the only relevant difference between the terms of the letting being that it contained a covenant by the plaintiffs, the landlords, to supply constant hot water and central heating. In 1946 there was an increase in general rates, in respect of which a notice of increase was served on April 20, 1946. The liability for general rates was transferred from the landlords to the tenant by notice dated February 20, 1947. On January 9, 1949, the flat was let to N under a tenancy agreement which differed from its predecessors in that the covenant as to repairs was a covenant by the tenant limited to the interior of the flat with an exception of fair wear and tear. The rent had been altered on account of the transfer to the tenant of the liability to pay the general rates and on the other hand increased by GBP 14 on account of the transfer to the landlords of the liability for external repairs and the exception of fair wear and tear from the tenant's repairing covenant. The flat was let to the defendants on February 12, 1953, the terms of the letting being in all respects identical with the terms of the letting to N. The rent was, however, increased by a further GBP 11 on account of the restriction to the interior of the flat of the tenant's repairing covenant and the exception from that covenant of fair wear and tear.

Held, on the determination of the recoverable rent,

(1) when the liability for general rates was transferred to the tenant by the notice of February 20, 1947, the "corresponding reduction" in the rent referred to in the the Act of 1920, s.2(3) proviso, which had to be made, was the amount of the rates payable at the date of the transfer, i.e., GBP 34; "the corresponding amount paid in respect of the â€¦ period which included September 1, 1939," within the meaning of s.2(1)(b) of the Act, was GBP 34 on account of the retrospective operation of the amendment by virtue of the [Rating and Valuation Act 1925 s.37(10)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3B4E0CC0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7ef83e93310a4accadf58ff9a9b600f4&contextData=(sc.Search)) ;

(2) there was in the letting to the defendants a transfer to the plaintiffs within the meaning of s.2(3) of the burden or liability in respect of repairs which was cast on the plaintiffs by the exclusion from the defendants' covenant of exterior repairs and of repairs attributable to fair wear and tear, notwithstanding that the immediately preceding letting to N. had cast on the plaintiffs the like burden or liability; the increase must be based on the cost to the plaintiffs of performing the transferred burden or liability in respect of repairs as at the date of such transfer, due allowance being made for the addition of GBP 14 to the rent on the letting to N;

(3) on the letting to the defendants there was, within the meaning of s.2(3), a transfer to the plaintiffs of a burden or liability previously borne by the tenant, in the shape of the obligation to supply central heating and constant hot water, inasmuch as under the letting of 1936, by reference to which the standard rent was fixed, the plaintiffs assumed no legal obligation to provide such supply, so that in point of legal liability the position then was that, while the plaintiffs might voluntarily provide such supply, the tenant could not compel them to do so, and, therefore, in the eye of the law the supply of constant hot water and central heating for the flat was a burden or liability borne by the tenant.
