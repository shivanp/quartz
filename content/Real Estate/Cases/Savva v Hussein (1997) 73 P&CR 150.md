# Savva v Hussein (1997) 73 P&CR 150

A lease of commercial premises was subject to a covenant, preventing the tenant from displaying signs or altering the premises without the landlordsâ€™ consent. The landlords served a notice under [s 146](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251925_20a_SECT_146%25&A=0.3309023654508437&backKey=20_T485466247&service=citation&ersKey=23_T485466238&langcountry=GB) of the Law of Property Act 1925, purporting to forfeit the lease on the grounds that the tenant had changed the signage, altered the frontage and constructed a flue without consent. The court found for the tenant. The landlords appealed. The Court of Appeal, Civil Division, dismissing the appeal, held that all of the breaches of covenant were capable of remedy. It was a remedy if the mischief caused by the breach could be removed. In the instant case, the lease was not forfeited because the notice under s 146 of the Act had not required that the breaches be remedied. The construction of the flue was a technical trespass, but because the landlords had not shown any loss, they were entitled only to a liberty to apply for an injunction or other remedy.

S, a landlord, appealed against the dismissal of a claim for possession against H, the tenant, following H's breach of a covenant not to erect signs or carry out alterations to the premises without S's consent. S had issued a notice under the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.146](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3970E850E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=82e8767558e247b1a152a0f0ec86aef0&contextData=(sc.Search)) which stated that the breach was incapable of remedy.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that in cases other than breach of a non-assignment covenant, breach of a negative covenant was capable of remedy. It became incapable of remedy only where a s.146 notice requiring a remedy had been served, and the lessee was permitted a reasonable period of time in which to comply and for the payment of appropriate compensation, but such compliance failed to remedy the harm which the lessor had suffered in consequence of the breach, _[Expert Clothing Service & Sales Ltd v Hillgate House Ltd [1986] Ch. 340, [1985] 3 WLUK 27](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA4DEC010E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=82e8767558e247b1a152a0f0ec86aef0&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered, _[Billson v Residential Apartments Ltd (1990) 60 P. & C.R. 392, [1990] 2 WLUK 251](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I74954CD0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=82e8767558e247b1a152a0f0ec86aef0&contextData=(sc.Search))_ not followed. S's notice should have stated the remedial action which H had to take in order to remedy the mischief and was invalid for not doing so.
