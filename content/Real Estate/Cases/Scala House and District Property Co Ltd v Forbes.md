# Scala House and District Property Co Ltd v Forbes

The first defendant was the lawful assignee of a lease which contained a covenant not to assign, sublet or part with possession of the premises demised. The plaintiffs discovered that there had been a breach of covenant and they served a notice under [s 146(1)](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251925_20a_SECT_146%25&A=0.6394352439045179&backKey=20_T485446336&service=citation&ersKey=23_T485446326&langcountry=GB) of Law of Property Act 1925 requiring the first defendant to remedy the breach. Faced with a denial by the first defendant’s solicitors that there had been any breach, the plaintiffs issued a writ and applied for summary judgment for forfeiture. The first defendant contended that the period that had elapsed between the notice and the issue of the writ was insufficient to enable him to remedy the breach. The Court of Appeal, Civil Division, held that a breach of covenant not to assign, sublet or part with possession was a once-and-for-all breach and was therefore one which was incapable of remedy. It was unnecessary under s 146(1)(b) of the Act for the plaintiffs’ notice to call on the first defendant to remedy the breach.
