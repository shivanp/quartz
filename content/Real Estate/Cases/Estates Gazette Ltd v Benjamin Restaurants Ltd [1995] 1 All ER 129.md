# Estates Gazette Ltd v Benjamin Restaurants Ltd [1995] 1 All ER 129

In 1980, BR obtained a lease of shop premises by deed of assignment. EG, the landlord, gave a licence to assign which included a covenant by BR "to pay the rents reserved by the lease at the time and in the manner therein provided for". BR remained the lessee until 1983 when the lease was assigned to K, who later defaulted on the rent and became bankrupt. The original tenant was also insolvent, and therefore EG proceeded against BR on the covenant. BR successfully denied liability for K's arrears on the grounds that liability was imposed only for the period when BR was the lessee and did not continue after assignment. EG appealed.

Held: Appeal allowed. The reference to the lease in the covenant had the effect of incorporating an obligation to pay for the whole remainder of the term. BR's liability did not end on assignment.
