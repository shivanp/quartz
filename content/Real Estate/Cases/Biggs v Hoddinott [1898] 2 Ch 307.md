# Biggs v Hoddinott [1898] 2 Ch 307

FACTS: The borrower mortgaged his freehold pub to a brewery. The mortgage included a covenant by the borrower to buy beer exclusively from the lender for the duration of the mortgage, which could not be redeemed for five years. After two years the borrower argued the solus tie was a clog on the equity of redemption.

HELD: Lord Justice Chitty refused to declare the tie void, saying that it is possible for the lender to gain a collateral advantage to himself, as long as it is not unconscionable or oppressive.
