# London Scottish Properties v Mehmet 1970 214 EG 837

In breach of covenant the defendant sublet premises to persons who used them to show "strip" films which were not in themselves immoral or obscene. These shows were advertised by notices and by touts in the street outside. Some of the customers were offered a more erotic show after their appetites had been whetted by the films shown.

Held, that the proceedings as a whole were immoral and that the lease ought to be forfeited.
