# Hyman v Rose [1912] AC 623

A building was on a repairing underlease subject to restrictive covenants, which prohibited its use for specified trades and specified structural changes. The assignees of the lease sought to use the building for carrying on a business of a cinematograph theatre, which was not a prohibited trade, and carried out alterations that breached the covenant. They applied for relief from forfeiture for breaches of covenant. The House of Lords held that in an application for relief from forfeiture for breaches of covenant under [s 14(2)](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251881_41a_SECT_14%25&A=0.18695940756395224&backKey=20_T485509380&service=citation&ersKey=23_T485509359&langcountry=GB) of the Conveyancing Act 1881, the court should consider all the circumstances and the conduct of the parties. Also, it should exercise the wide discretion vested in it unfettered by rigid rules. In the instant case, the alterations made were permissible. Thus, the application should be granted subject to the remedying of the breaches of the covenant and to an undertaking to deposit a sum of money for the ultimate restoration of the building.
