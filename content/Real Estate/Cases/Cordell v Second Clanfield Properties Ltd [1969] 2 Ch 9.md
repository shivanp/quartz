# Cordell v Second Clanfield Properties Ltd [1969] 2 Ch 9

**FACTS:**

Cordell sold development land and reserved a right of way over the estate road for the benefit of Cordell’s retained land. At the time there was an access way 12 feet wide serving Cordell’s retained land. Sometime later, Cordell sought a declaration that he was entitled to a right of way 28 feet wide at all times and for all purposes.

**HELD:**

If Cordell had needed such an extensive right of way, he should have specifically stated it in the transfer deed, making sure that the reservation covered any future needs he may have. The claim failed.
