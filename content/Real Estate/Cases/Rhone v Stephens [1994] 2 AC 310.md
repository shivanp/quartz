# Rhone v Stephens [1994] 2 AC 310

R appealed against the decision of the Court of Appeal (Times, January 21, 1993) to allow the appeal of S, executrix of the estate of the last owner of Walford House, against an order that she was bound by a covenant entered into by her predecessor in title to repair part of the roof of the house which overhung R's property, Walford Cottage.

Held: Appeal dismissed. The Court of Appeal were right not to overrule _[Austerberry v Oldham Corp (1885) 29 Ch. D. 750, [1885] 5 WLUK 19](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6CAC2750E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=93649a1137a240129a69542ead81f2ee&contextData=(sc.Default))_ which held that, although equity could prevent or punish the breach of negative covenants which restricted the user of freehold land, it could not compel an owner to comply with positive covenants entered into by his predecessors in title. While recommendations had been made for reforming the law relating to positive and restrictive obligation, no legislation had resulted, and overruling Austerberry would create a number of difficulties and uncertainties. R's argument that this was an exceptional case, such as Tito v Waddell (No.2) [1977] 1 Ch. 106 , under the "pure principle of benefit and burden" could not be accepted because conditions attached to the exercise of a power could only be enforceable if relevant to the exercise of the right to which they were attached, _[Halsall v Brizell [1957] Ch. 169, [1956] 11 WLUK 118](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB91A0A80E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=93649a1137a240129a69542ead81f2ee&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.
