# Dong Bang Minerva (UK) v Davina [1996] 3 WLUK 117

D, the landlord, appealed against an order that it was in breach of its duty under the [Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 s.1(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6A172190E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1d238d2a0ea042319f1319a0b4415e1c&contextData=(sc.Default)) by requiring an unreasonable condition from DBM, the tenant, on a request for a licence to underlet and was liable for unsettled damages for the failure of the proposed underletting. D had required an undertaking that DBM indemnify it against specified costs of GBP 4,500 for a standard licence to underlet.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that although it might be acceptable for a landlord to require an undertaking as to his reasonable costs before consenting to an underlease, in the instant case the estimated fees were unreasonable and the landlord was in breach of its statutory duty.
