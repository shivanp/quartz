# Adealon International Property Ltd v Merton BC [2007] EWCA Civ 362

In _Adealon v Merton BC_ where the seller sold land forming part of its property to the buyer without granting a right of way, no easement was acquired by necessity over the servient land as it was possible that a third party could grant a right of way over their neighbouring land to the buyer.

---

## Summary

A claim to a right of way over a plot of land failed where, at the time of the transfer of the land, the grantor had not expressly reserved a right of way, and there was a realistic possibility of alternative access over the land of third parties.

## Abstract

The appellant (P) appealed against a decision (_[Adealon International Corp Proprietary Ltd v Merton LBC [2006] EWHC 1075 (Ch), [2006] 2 E.G.L.R. 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I683290F0EC8911DAA302F1B38251C4C6/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=db347db8111b4fe3bf08759e50c5e715&contextData=(sc.Default))_) that it was not entitled to an easement of necessity over a plot of land for access purposes.

P owned a strip of land (the red land) that was bounded by a road to the south. The respondent local authority owned the land adjacent to that plot (the green land), which was bounded by a road to the north. The red land had no direct access to the northern road, and access to the southern road could not be obtained without planning permission. Both plots of land had been owned by a company (B). P's director (H) was the beneficial owner of a company that had acquired the shares in B. B transferred the green land to the local authority's predecessor in title (K), a company in which H also had a beneficial interest. K subsequently sold the green land to the local authority. Thereafter, B transferred the red land and assigned all causes of action pertaining to the land to P. P claimed that, on the severance of the two plots, it became entitled by operation of law to an easement of necessity over the green land to give it access to the northern road. The judge dismissed P's claim.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

The principle of an easement of necessity was one of implication from the circumstances of a grant of land and not a freestanding rule of public policy, _[Nickerson v Barroughclough [1981] Ch. 426, [1980] 12 WLUK 141](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0D122A51E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=db347db8111b4fe3bf08759e50c5e715&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The classic case of an easement of necessity was where the land of one party to a grant was entirely surrounded by that of the other. Where there was a realistic possibility of alternative access over the land of third parties, the case for an easement of necessity was less clear. The presumption was that any rights that the grantor required over the land transferred would have been expressly reserved in the grant, and the burden lay on the grantor to establish an exception. To that issue, the existence of other realistic possibilities of access were clearly relevant. The instant case concerned implied reservation, not implied grant. H had not been concerned about the need to reserve a specific right of access to the north. His main concern appeared to have been to control the possibility of future access to the south on the prospect of future planning permission. That was far from creating the basis for an implied right and there was nothing to overcome the ordinary presumption that, had H required an easement to the north, he would have made a specific reservation in the grant. In the circumstances, there was no reason to depart from the judge's overall conclusion that P did not have a right of way over the green land.
