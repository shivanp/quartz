# Atwood v Bovis Homes [2001] Ch 371

The dominant land, which had always been used for agricultural purposes, had a prescriptive right to drain surface water over neighbouring land. Though the proposed development of a housing estate on the dominant land, would be very substantial, the right could still be enjoyed and would not be lost. An easement had been acquired by prescription, but after such acquisition, the nature of the use of the dominant tenement changed, substantially increasing the burden of the easement.  

Held: Such increased usage could lead to a loss or suspension of the easement. The result might however differ according to the nature of the easement. It would be more readily follow in right of way cases than in rights of support. In this case a right of discharge of water from land developed from agricultural use would not lead to a loss of the easement.
