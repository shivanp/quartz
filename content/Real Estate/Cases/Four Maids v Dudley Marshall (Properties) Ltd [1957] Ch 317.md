# Four Maids v Dudley Marshall (Properties) Ltd [1957] Ch 317

The right of a mortgagee to possession in the absence of some specific contract has nothing to do with default on the part of the mortgagor. The mortgagor may go into possession at any time after execution of the mortgage unless by a term expressed or necessarily implied in the contract he has contracted himself out of that right. If there is an attornment clause, he must give notice. A mortgagee took out a summons under [RSC Ord.55 r.5a](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I94D99940E4AB11DA9407CBB86AE37856/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=92ddc7b69dbb4742b33f3883fa42db93&contextData=(sc.Default)) , asking for an order for possession of the mortgaged property. The mortgage contained a provision that so long as interest was punctually paid the mortgage money would not be called in before December 31, 1958. The mortgage interest had fallen into arrear, although the interest was not in arrear at the time of the hearing of the summons.

Held, the mortgagee was entitled to an order for possession; there would be such an order, but its operation would be postponed for two months.
