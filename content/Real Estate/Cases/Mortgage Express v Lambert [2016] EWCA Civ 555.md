# Mortgage Express v Lambert [2016] EWCA Civ 555

## Summary

Where the sale of a flat had been set aside as an unconscionable bargain, the equitable right belonging to the original seller was capable of being an overriding interest and a proprietary right under the [Land Registration Act 2002](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FA1ABB1E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)). However, as the buyers had subsequently obtained a mortgage and ceased repayments, the seller's equitable interest was overreached by the grant of the mortgage under [s.26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70F3AD80E45211DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the 2002 Act and the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38C08410E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)), and the mortgage company was entitled to possession.

## Abstract

The appellant appealed against a possession order made in favour of the respondent mortgage company.

The appellant had owned a flat worth £120,000 but could not make mortgage repayments. Two buyers offered to buy it for £30,000 and let her continue living there indefinitely. She agreed. The buyers applied to the respondent for a mortgage, naming the flat's value at £120,000. The respondent asked about any overriding interests; the appellant did not mention her continuing occupancy. She sold it with a full title guarantee under a contract providing for vacant possession on completion. The mortgage went unpaid and the respondent appointed receivers, who began possession proceedings against the appellant. The judge set aside the sale on the ground that it was an unconscionable bargain, but decided that that entitlement was not binding on the respondent, and made the possession order.

The issues were (1) whether the appellant was entitled to pursue her alternative claim to a leasehold interest in the flat; (2) the legal character of the right to set aside the sale as an unconscionable bargain, how that fitted into the scheme of [[Land registration]], and whether the appellant was precluded from asserting her claim against the respondent.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The appellant was no longer entitled to pursue the alternative claim, which was founded on the continuing effectiveness of the bargain with the buyers. That had been set aside. The appellant's notice only disputed the charge to the respondent. She had elected to pursue that route and could not rely on the alternative claim, _[Tang Man Sit (Deceased) v Capacious Investments Ltd [1996] A.C. 514, [1995] 12 WLUK 333](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC7CD5B80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed (see paras [14-15](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) A right to set aside a transaction for misrepresentation or undue influence was "an equity" or a "mere equity". The right to set aside an unconscionable bargain was no different. The equity did not arise only on completion of the sale; it was a right to set aside the bargain, which existed at the exchange of contracts. Under the [Land Registration Act 2002 s.116](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7126A460E45211DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)), a mere equity was an interest capable of binding successors in title. [Sch.3 para.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I383A6420E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the 2002 Act set out certain overriding interests but did not create rights, it merely preserved existing ones. If the rights of a person in actual occupation did not give priority over the registered estate holder, Sch.3 para.2 did not change those rights. There were exceptions to the general proposition that an interest belonging to a person in actual occupation was overriding. An equitable right to rectification of a lease was capable of enduring through successive ownerships, and hence of sufficient proprietary character to qualify as an overriding interest, _[Nurdin & Peacock Plc v DB Ramsden & Co Ltd (Rectification Claim) [1999] 1 E.G.L.R. 119, [1998] 7 WLUK 367](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B682280E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied. A right to have an unconscionable bargain set aside was no different. In principle, the appellant's right to have the sale set aside was capable of being an overriding interest, and was proprietary in character. Since the buyers were joint registered proprietors, they held the legal estate as trustees of land under the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.34](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38D28570E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)) and [s.35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38D396E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)). Once completion took place they were entitled to charge the estate, free from any limitation affecting the validity of the disposition, subject to the exceptions in [s.26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70F3AD80E45211DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the 2002 Act. An overriding interest would not affect the validity of the grant of the mortgage, which would take effect subject to it. The purpose of s.26 was to prevent the disponee's title being called into question. The respondent contended that the appellant could not call its title into question, because if the right asserted as an overriding interest was a right to impugn the title acquired by the disponee, it was defeated by s.26. That was strongly supported by the Report of the Law Commission and HM Land Registry at the time of the 2002 Act's creation. Additionally, under [s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38C08410E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search)) of the 1925 Act, where there was a sale or mortgage made by two trustees, and the capital monies were paid to both, what would amount to an overriding interest was shifted from the land to the sale or mortgage proceeds. The question was whether the appellant's interest was capable of being overreached. Section 116 of the 2002 Act assimilated mere equities and other more traditional equitable interests. Therefore, if the appellant had an interest that was potentially an overriding interest, it was overreached by the grant of the mortgage by two trustees (paras [16-18, 21-32, 36-39](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) If it had been necessary to decide, the appellant had not disclosed the right she asserted before the grant of the mortgage. The contract had provided for vacant possession and she gave a full title guarantee. It would have been reasonable for her to disclose that she was not in fact giving vacant possession. If the occupier did not reveal their rights, they could not thereafter assert them. Even if the respondent had had notice of the undervalue, the philosophy behind the 2002 Act was that notice was irrelevant, _[Williams & Glyn's Bank Ltd v Boland [1981] A.C. 487, [1980] 6 WLUK 211](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I01451E70E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4627ff7a6fbf42ac92c772a701e47ef3&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed. The allegation of the respondent's notice was the sole reason advanced for disabling it from relying on her failure to disclose the true arrangement. As that reason was not a good one, the appellant did not have an overriding interest that bound the respondent (paras [40-44](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
