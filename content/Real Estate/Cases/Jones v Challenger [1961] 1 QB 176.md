# Jones v Challenger [1961] 1 QB 176

**FACTS:** A husband and wife bought a property together as beneficial joint tenants, and it became their matrimonial home. They had no children. The wife left the husband for another man, and the husband continued to live in the property for a further three years. The wife applied for an order for sale under **LPA 1925,** s 30 the predecessor of **TLATA 1996, s 14.** At first instance, the order was refused on the basis that it was unreasonable to turn the husband out of his home.

**HELD:** On appeal, the order was granted. The correct test was not one of reasonableness, **but whether the purpose for which the property was bought still continued.**

**DEVLIN LJ:** the house was acquired as the matrimonial home.[…] But with the end of the marriage, that purpose was dissolved. […] If the husband wanted time to obtain alternative accommodation, the sale could be postponed for that purpose, but he has not asked for that. If he was prepared to buy out the wife's interest, it might be proper to allow it, but he has not accepted a suggestion that terms of that sort should be made. In these circumstances, there is no way in which the discretion can properly be exercised except by an order to sell…’

Even though the husband wanted the purpose to continue, a joint purpose cannot be carried out unilaterally.

One of two trustees for sale can insist on the execution of the trust for sale if that will not defeat the purpose of the trust, and he is a person whose voice should be allowed to prevail. A husband and wife held the lease of the matrimonial home as joint tenants upon trust for sale and upon trust for themselves as tenants in common in equal shares. They were divorced, and the wife remarried, and the husband lived on in the house. The wife applied under the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.30](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38CF9F40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4402cbb441a9438a8194fab59e52686f&contextData=(sc.Default)), for an order for sale of the house.

Held, such an order should be made as the house was no longer needed as a matrimonial home and the wife should be allowed to realise her half of the investment.

If the court thinks it proper to give one party or the other the right to reside in the house after the marriage is over, it is not then necessarily interfering with the equal division of property held in equal shares. If there is other property to be divided, an overall equality may be reached; or if there is not, the necessary adjustment may be made in the settlement of alimony or maintenance”.
