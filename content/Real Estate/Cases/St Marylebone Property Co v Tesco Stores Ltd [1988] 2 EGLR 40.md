# St Marylebone Property Co v Tesco Stores Ltd [1988] 2 EGLR 40

The lease contained a covenant 'not to use, carry on or permit or suffer to be used, exercised or carried on in or upon the demised premises or any part thereof any trade or business whatsoever other than that of grocers provisions wine spirit and beer merchants without the consent in writing of the landlord for that purpose first having been obtained'. The issue arose as to whether the sale of newspapers, records, tapes and small electrical articles and the incorporation into the premises of a video hire business was in breach of the covenant in the tenancy. The Chancery Division held that the landlord was entitled to forfeit the lease for breach of the covenant in the tenancy.
