# Thatcher v Pearce [1968] 1 WLR 748

Where rent is in arrear and the landlord re-enters without any order of the court under a forfeiture clause in the lease, the tenant can, in a proper case, obtain relief more than six months later; in such a case the provisions of the [Common Law Procedure Act 1852](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I611D9D51E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=56aaad934d7444f3966a0a0f6988883d&contextData=(sc.Default)) do not apply. The defendant landlord peaceably re-entered the demised premises under a forfeiture clause in the lease, rent being overdue. The plaintiff tenant was in prison at the time of re-entry but he acted as soon as he could to obtain relief against forfeiture; he issued a summons claiming such relief more than six months after the re-entry. It was contended by the defendant that the plaintiff was out of time, having regard to the provisions of the 1852 Act.

Held, that the plaintiff could claim equitable relief and in the circumstances would be granted such relief.
