# Penn v Wilkins (1974) 236 E.G. 203

The plaintiff sought an injunction to restrain the defendant from interfering with the passage of sewage from a cesspit in a property conveyed to her in 1946. She claimed the right to have the cesspit emptied by means of a tanker stationed in the road outside the centre way adjoining the defendantâ€™s house and to have the sewage passed through pipes laid along the rear access way and the centre way. The defendant counterclaimed an injunction to restrain the plaintiff from encroaching upon rights of user declared in a court judgment. The issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to the easement she claimed. The Chancery Division held that there was nothing in the 1946 conveyance that created an easement of passage over the rear access way and centre way for sewage disposal when for so long there was no disposal of that kind. The plaintiff could not confer on herself an easement of necessity by creating a situation in which she needed the easement. Thus, no easement was established.

X and Y, neighbours, had rights of way along a passage between their houses. X claimed a right to lay pipes along the passage next to her house for the passage of sewage from a cesspit, built by her in her back garden, to a sewage tanker.

Held, inter alia, that  
(1) no such right was within the words of the respective conveyances especially the words "as at present subsisting";  
(2) nor did the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.62](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38E0B640E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b3bc0179989e4b24b992f37634bc3c9e&contextData=(sc.Search)) confer such a right, as s.62 did not resurrect mere memories of past rights no longer appurtenant at the time of conveyance.
