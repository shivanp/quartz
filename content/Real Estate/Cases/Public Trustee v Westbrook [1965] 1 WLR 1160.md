# Public Trustee v Westbrook [1965] 1 WLR 1160

It is proper to refuse relief from forfeiture where twenty-two years have passed without any rent being paid in respect of the sub-leases of houses on a bombed site, those sub-leases having been treated as gone altogether, and where to grant relief would be a hardship on the head lessee and his purchaser. P held a head lease of land, granted in 1853. There was also a sub-sub-lease granted in the same year, the holder of which had disappeared. There had also been a sub-sublease. In 1940 the whole area was bombed and, since that time, no rent had been paid other than by P. In 1962 D bought the sub-sub-lease, knowing that no rent had been paid since 1940. In 1963 P agreed to sell his lease to a purchaser, contracting to see that the under-leases were extinguished. P therefore took out forfeiture proceedings against D for non-payment of rent. D counterclaimed for relief from forfeiture under s.146(4) of the [Law of Property Act 1925](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60CA4D31E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2b419149457f45e9bd3a35101752b3a1&contextData=(sc.Default)) . D's counterclaim was dismissed and an order for possession made in favour of P.

Held, dismissing D's appeal, that in the circumstances the decision was right.
