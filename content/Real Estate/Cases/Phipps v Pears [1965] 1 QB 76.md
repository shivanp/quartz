# Phipps v Pears [1965] 1 QB 76

The protection of a structure from the weather is neither an easement nor such a right known to the law as will impliedly pass on a conveyance under the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.62](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38E0B640E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c400d10e25a7477c8e7df3e9c5f157a0&contextData=(sc.Default)) . In about 1930 the common owner of two houses pulled one down and rebuilt it close to, but getting no support from, the other, the nearest walls not being bonded together. He later sold the new house to P, and the old house was sold after his death to R who demolished it, leaving the flank wall of the new house exposed for the first time to the weather, which did damage. P sued R for damages on the footing of an implied easement on the sale to him of a right of protection from weather.

Held, that there was no such easement, nor was there a right known to the law which passed on the conveyance to P under s.62 of the Law of Property Act, 1925.
