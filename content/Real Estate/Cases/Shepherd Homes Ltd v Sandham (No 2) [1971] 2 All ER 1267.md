# Shepherd Homes Ltd v Sandham (No 2) [1971] 2 All ER 1267

The jurisdiction of the Lands Tribunal to modify restrictive covenants extends to covenants binding only between the original covenantor and covenantee. The covenantee under restrictive covenants in a conveyance sued the covenantor for breach of the restrictions and sought an interlocutory injunction. The proceedings were stayed so that the covenantor could refer the covenants to the Lands Tribunal: [1970] C.L.Y. 2293. The covenantee sought a removal of the stay on the grounds that the Lands Tribunal had no jurisdiction, the covenant being on its construction a purely personal one, and that that question of construction should be determined by the court.

Held, refusing to lift the stay,

(1) that the jurisdiction of the Lands Tribunal was not limited to covenants the burden and benefit of which was capable of running with land, but extended to purely personal covenants provided they "affected" land;

(2) that in any event it was possible that the covenants did run with the land and there was no reason why that point of construction should not be decided by the Lands Tribunal.
