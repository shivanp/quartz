# Ropemaker Properties v Noonhaven [1989] 2 EGLR 50

The defendants were lessees of premises which had been used for the purpose of prostitution. They claimed to have been unaware of what was happening at the premises and that only the managers and staff were aware. The user clause in the lease was for ‘a high-class restaurant/night club’. The landlords took this to be a breach of covenant and forfeited the lease. The defendants sought relief from forfeiture. The Chancery Division granted relief on the basis that the case was exceptional. The court further laid out a list of factors to be considered in such cases.
