# Edlington Properties Ltd v JH Fenner & Co Ltd (2006) 1 WLR 1583

FACTS: The tenant had a claim against the former landlord for damages. The tenant was in arrears of rent owed to the new landlord.

HELD: The tenant was not entitled to withhold this rent from the new landlord and set off one claim against the other. These were two separate matters involving different parties relating to separate preand post-assignment breaches, and the new landlord was not responsible for the breach of the former landlord.

## Summary

A lessee was not entitled to set off a claim for damages against the original freeholder for defective construction of the building against post assignment rent due to the assignee of the freehold.

## Abstract

The appellant lessee (F) appealed against a decision ([2005] EWHC 2158, [2006] 1 All E.R. 98) on a preliminary issue that it was not entitled to set off claims it had against its former landlord (W) against rent due to the respondent assignee of the reversion (E). W had owned the freehold of a site and had concluded an agreement with F that obliged W to build a factory on the site and F to take a lease of it once it was built. F contended that W was in breach of its building obligations contained in the building agreement by constructing a factory that was defective and inadequate. W assigned the freehold to a third party, and it was then assigned to E. E claimed for rent due under F's tenancy, and an issue arose as to whether F had a right to set off its damages claim against W for the alleged breaches of the building agreement against E's claim for rent. The judge determined that F could not set off its claim for damages against the rent due to E. F contended that a tenant was entitled to invoke by way of set off against the rent due to an assignee of the reversion a claim against the original landlord for unliquidated damages for breach of a term of the buildings contract under which the lease was granted either because

(1) the assignee of the reversion took subject to the equities which, at the date of assignment, could have been invoked against the assignor and/or

(2) the tenant's right of equitable set off against the original landlord was a right that ran with the land, and was therefore enforceable against a purchaser of the reversion.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) the effect of the assignment of a reversion to a lease was governed by the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.141(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I396EEC80E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c14f84cb400840efb74bc9ffb185744d&contextData=(sc.Default)) in relation to leases granted before January 1, 1996, and by the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39B6A3E0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c14f84cb400840efb74bc9ffb185744d&contextData=(sc.Default)) for leases granted after that date. Section 3 of the 1995 Act applied in the instant case and a covenant to pay rent was clearly within the ambit of that section. When the reversion to a lease was assigned, the assignee, the new landlord, had the right to recover the rent under the lease in his own right and did not need to claim through the assignor, the original landlord. That position had to be contrasted with an assignment of a right to recover a debt or other chose in action. Whilst in recent years the contractual nature of a lease had become more prominent, the fact remained that it was still an interest in land and it was not hard to see that the right to recover rent should be an incident of the reversion and have different features from the right to recover a debt unassociated with any interest in land.

(2) A tenant's right to claim damages against a predecessor in title of the present landlord, whether or not it arose under a covenant, was a personal right that was not an interest in land. The fact that it was invoked for the purpose of impeaching the right to recover rent under the lease could not convert it into an interest in land. The notion that the benefit or burden of a covenant could run with the term or with the reversion was familiar and well established. However it was an entirely different notion, and was contrary to principle, to contend that a liability to pay damages for an accrued breach of covenant ran with the reversion (or with the term). Accordingly, whilst it was true that the claim was being invoked to impeach a liability that had arisen out of the lease, namely a liability to pay rent, it was not a claim that could in any way be said to be proprietary in character. The very nature of an equitable set off was that it was personal in nature, _[Reeves v Pope [1914] 2 K.B. 284, [1914] 1 WLUK 69](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I852CA010E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c14f84cb400840efb74bc9ffb185744d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Mortgage Corp Ltd v Ubah (1997) 29 H.L.R. 489, [1996] 3 WLUK 92](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I05C7DCE0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c14f84cb400840efb74bc9ffb185744d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , and _[Muscat v Smith [2003] EWCA Civ 962, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 2853, [2003] 7 WLUK 296](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I09D1F370E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c14f84cb400840efb74bc9ffb185744d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
