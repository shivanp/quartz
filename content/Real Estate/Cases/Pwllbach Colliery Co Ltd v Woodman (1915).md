# Pwllbach Colliery Co Ltd v Woodman (1915)

A colliery company were sublessees of land leased to a tinplate company, with power to that company to carry on, on the demised premises, the trades authorised by their memorandum of association, which included the trade of miners. A butcher held the adjacent land under a subsequent lease from the same landowner, and he built thereon a slaughter house and sausage factory. Subsequently, the colliery company erected on the land demised to them screening apparatus near the butcher's trade buildings and as a result of their screening operations coal dust was deposited on these buildings. The House of Lords held that the grant of the right to carry on the trade of miners did not authorise the committal of a nuisance, in the absence of proof that the trade could not be carried on otherwise, and the plaintiff was not precluded by the terms or the circumstances of the grant from obtaining relief.
