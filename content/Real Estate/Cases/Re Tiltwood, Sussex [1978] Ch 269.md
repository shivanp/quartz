# Re Tiltwood, Sussex [1978] Ch 269

Where the fees simple of land benefited, and of land burdened by restrictive covenants become vested in the same person, the restrictive covenants are extinguished unless the common owner recreates them. P purchased agricultural land which was part of the estate of a mansion house. To protect the view of the house P covenanted with V, the vendor, to use the land for agricultural purposes only and not to erect any building. X bought the mansion and its grounds, and subsequently also about half of P's land. X sold some of the land to the defendants, and some burdened land to the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought a declaration that X's purchase of the burdened land had created unity of seisin and that the land was no longer subject to the covenants.

Held, that since the common owner had not re-imposed the covenants when dividing up and selling the land, the plaintiff was entitled to a declaration that the covenants were extinguished.
