# Standard Pattern Co Ltd v Ivey [1962] Ch 432

The [Common Law Procedure Act 1852 s.212](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I05E84FA0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1dbcb714712b4b32af504c5df483f6cb&contextData=(sc.Default)) (which provides for an automatic stay of an action in ejectment by a landlord on account of arrears of rent on the tenant paying the arrears and costs into court), applies only if the rent is six months in arrear. A landlord sued his tenant by specially indorsed writ claiming forfeiture of his lease for failure to pay a quarter's rent, two quarters' water rates, cost of fuel and for breaches of other covenants. The tenant admitted breaches of the pecuniary covenants, denied breaches of the other covenants, counterclaimed for relief against forfeiture, and gave notice of payment into court stating that the amount paid in was enough to satisfy the landlord's claim under s.212 of the Act. The landlord moved for judgment on the tenant's admissions.

Held, that as rent was not six months in arrear, s.212 did not apply, but that equitable relief against forfeiture should in the circumstances be granted. _[Howard v Fanshawe [1895] 2 Ch. 581, [1895] 6 WLUK 100](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC3F5E320E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1dbcb714712b4b32af504c5df483f6cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished and dictum of Jenkins, L.J. in _[Gill v Lewis [1956] 2 Q.B. 1, [1956] 3 WLUK 59](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAEDD5810E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1dbcb714712b4b32af504c5df483f6cb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.
