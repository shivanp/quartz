# Antoniades v Villiers [1990] 1 AC 417

**FACTS:** The accommodation comprised a small attic flat with a bedroom, sitting room, kitchen and bathroom. The occupiers, a couple, had been looking for somewhere to live together for several months. When they viewed the flat, they asked for a double bed to be provided. They signed separate agreements which were identical; including the level of payments. The agreements reserved a right for the landowner to introduce others to share, and indeed to share the premises himself with the occupants. They also contained acknowledgements that the occupants did not have exclusive possession and that the agreements constituted a licence, and that the agreements would be terminated if the parties married.

**HELD:** The House of Lords held it could not realistically have been contemplated that the landlord would either himself use or occupy any part of the flat or put some other person in to share accommodation specifically adapted for the occupation by a couple living together.

In respect of the clauses, Lord Oliver commented

> 'these clauses cannot be considered as seriously intended to have any practical operation or to serve any purpose apart from the purely technical one of seeking to avoid the ordinary legal consequences attendant upon letting the appellants into possession at a monthly rent'.
