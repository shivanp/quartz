# London & Blenheim Estates Ltd v Ladbroke Retail Parks Ltd [1992]

## Abstract

The grant of a right to nominate unspecified land as the dominant tenement of an easement is not in itself sufficient to create an interest in land which binds successors in title to the servient tenement. The registered owner of land transferred part of his land to P together with certain rights and easements over the land retained by the transferer. By cl.11 of the transfer, if P purchased other land and gave notice to the transferor, within five years of the original transfer, that such land was to be included in the transferred land, such additional land would also benefit from the same rights and easements over the retained land. P subsequently purchased additional land adjoining the retained land, which was land capable of being benefited by the rights and easements. Shortly thereafter the retained land was transferred to W who sold it to D. Within the required five years, but after the transfer to W, P gave notice to W under cl. 11 that the additional land was to be included in the transferred land. D disputed this and P issued proceedings for a declaration in his favour. The judge held that cl. 11 had not created an interest in land as there was no dominant tenement (i.e. the additional land) before the servient tenement had been disposed of by the grantor of the right, thus the right in the transfer to include land which could be benefited did not bind D as successors in title to the servient tenement. P appealed.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) since land could not be encumbered with burdens of uncertain extent, the grant of a right to nominate unspecified land as the dominant tenement of an easement was not in itself sufficient to create an interest in land which bound successors in title to the servient tenement;

(2) although P's option to create an easement over the retained land was capable of being an interest in land, until the dominant tenement was identified, an essential part of the interest to be granted was left uncertain. Since the servient tenement had been disposed of by the grantor before the dominant tenement had been created the contract had not created an interest in land binding on D (_[Turley v Mackay [1944] Ch. 37, [1943] 5 WLUK 3](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/IDEF083A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a32dad0af1f4009afc181a6b637fb6b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished); and (3) an interest in land binding on successors in title to the servient tenement did not arise when P acquired the additional land, irrespective of notice, but only when the required notice had been given, since that was one of the express conditions of the transfer (_[Pritchard v Briggs [1980] Ch. 338, [1979] 4 WLUK 115](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/Document/I290B4481E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4a32dad0af1f4009afc181a6b637fb6b&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
