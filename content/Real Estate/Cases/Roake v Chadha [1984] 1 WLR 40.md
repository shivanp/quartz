# Roake v Chadha [1984] 1 WLR 40

Where a restrictive covenant is said not to enure for the benefit of subsequent purchasers unless expressly assigned it is clear that the benefit is not annexed to the land and so did not enure for their benefit under the terms of the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.62 and s.78](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38E0B640E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=05bb56cd7593431296f8baddd78fc29f&contextData=(sc.Default)).

In 1934 one of a number of plots of land was sold to D's predecessors in title under a standard form of transfer containing as part of a covenant with the vendor a stipulation against building more than one dwelling-house on the plot. The covenant contained the words

> "And the purchaser to the intent and so as to bind (so far as practicable) the land hereby transferred … hereby covenants with the vendor, but so that this covenant shall not enure for the benefit of any owner or subsequent purchaser of any part of the … estate unless the benefit of this covenant shall be expressly assigned …"

Similar standard forms of transfer (although later in date) to P's predecessors in title in respect of two nearby plots of land were in the same terms. Neither transfer contained any express assignment of the benefit of the covenant contained in the transfer to D's predecessors. P sought an injunction to restrain D from building another house on their plot claiming that the benefit of the covenant with the vendor in the transfer to D's predecessor in title had become annexed to each of P's plots by reason of s.78 of the L.P.A. 1925 whereby such covenants were to have effect as if successors in title to the covenantee had been expressed. Alternatively, they claimed that the benefit had passed as appertaining or as reputed to appertain to the land within the meaning of s.62 of the Act.

Held, that although under s.78 no express terms were required for the benefit of a covenant relating to land to be annexed to the land, the section could not have effect irrespective of the terms of the covenant and where, as here, the covenant was not to enure for the benefit of subsequent purchasers unless expressly assigned, it was clear that the benefit was not annexed to the land: in these circumstances, the covenant could not be deemed to have ensured for the benefit of P under s.78 and since there had been no assignment of the benefit of the covenant, it could not "appertain or be reputed to appertain" to the land under s.62 of the Act (_[Federated Homes Ltd v Mill Lodge Properties Ltd [1980] 1 W.L.R. 594, [1979] 11 WLUK 255](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA5F18FA1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=05bb56cd7593431296f8baddd78fc29f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).

The defendant's predecessor covenanted with a vendor that only one house would be built on the land he was buying. The covenant provided that it would not run for the benefit of a subsequent purchaser unless it was expressly assigned. There was no express assignment of the benefit. The defendant decided to build a second house on the land. The plaintiff owners of the houses surrounding the defendant's land claimed to be entitled to the benefit of that covenant on the ground that it was annexed to their plots under [s 78](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251925_20a_SECT_78%25&A=0.4869336275196041&backKey=20_T445173978&service=citation&ersKey=23_T445173969&langcountry=GB) of the Law of Property Act 1925. The Chancery Division held that s 78 of the Act did not annex the benefit of a covenant irrespective of the other express terms of that covenant. In the instant case, as it was stated that the covenant would not endure for the benefit of any future owner unless expressly assigned, the benefit of that covenant could not be annexed in the absence of any assignment.
