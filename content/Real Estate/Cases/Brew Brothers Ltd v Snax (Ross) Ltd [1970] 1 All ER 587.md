# Brew Brothers Ltd v Snax (Ross) Ltd [1970] 1 All ER 587

FACTS: a 14-year lease of a fish and chip shop contained a full repairing covenant by the tenant. The flank wall cracked and tilted over next door’s garage forecourt. The wall’s condition was attributed to seepage of water through defective drains covered by the repairing covenants. Underpinning works were necessary, costing some £8,000. The building as a whole was valued at between £7,500–£9,500.

HELD: It was held that the necessary work did not fall within the scope of the repairing covenant; the question was one of degree in each case.

In June 1965 the freehold owners leased certain premises for a term of 14 years. Clause 2 of the lease contained covenants by the tenants regarding repairs, payment of maintenance expenses and viewing by the landlords. In November 1966, the flank wall of the premises titled towards the plaintiffs' neighbouring premises. It was shored up but caused an obstruction for 18 months. The cause of the condition was the seeping of water from certain drains and the removal of a tree by the tenants. The plaintiffs brought an action against both the landlords and the tenants, but the landlords, in third-party proceedings, contended that the responsibility fell on the tenants. Megaw, J. found that the fault did not fall under the tenants' covenant to repair but that both the landlords and the tenants were liable in damages for nuisance.

On appeal by the landlords, held,

(1) that the tenants were responsible for repairing defects pointed out by the landlords;

(2) that the landlords must be presumed to know the state of the premises and were liable for nuisance in that they suffered the state of affairs to continue;

(3) that the tenants were jointly liable for nuisance in that they failed to abate it;

(4) that the question of whether the work constituted repair was to be determined by looking at the work as a whole; and

(5) that the work required to be done by the tenants was outside the scope of the repairing covenant. Per Harman L.J. (dissenting): The defective drains and the wall, but not the new foundations, were within the repairing covenant. (Decision of Megaw, J.
