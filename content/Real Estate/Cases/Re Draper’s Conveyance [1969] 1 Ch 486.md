# Re Draperâ€™s Conveyance [1969] 1 Ch 486

The writing in this case was a divorce petition issued by the wife, which included a request for an order that the matrimonial home be sold immediately and the proceeds of sale split equally. The husband died before the house was sold.

The wife argued that he died as a joint tenant and that she took the house by survivorship. The court disagreed. The divorce papers showed that she had a clear intention for the joint tenancy to be severed immediately. Therefore the husband had a 50% share as tenant in common at the date of his death.

Severance of a joint tenancy in the matrimonial home may be effected by the wife's issue of a summons under the [Married Women's Property Act 1882 s.17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1E9DB080E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5860e2bbf94b486489bf07aba06fde40&contextData=(sc.Default)) and her affidavit in support thereof. In 1951 a house was conveyed to a husband and wife in fee simple as joint tenants at law and of the proceeds of the trust for sale. In November 1965 the wife was granted a decree nisi of divorce, which was made absolute in March 1966. In February 1966 she applied by summons under s.17 of the 1882 Act for an order that the house should be sold; in her affidavit in support she asked that the proceeds of sale be distributed equally between the husband and her. An order to that effect was made in May 1966, and in August 1966 another order was obtained under the 1882 Act that the "husband" give up possession of the house. Despite this he remained in possession until January 1967 when a writ of possession was executed. Four days later he died intestate. On application by the "wife" to determine whether she held the beneficial interest in any proceeds of sale for herself absolutely or for herself and the deceased's estate as tenants in common in equal shares, held that she held it as trustee for herself and the estate as tenants in common in equal shares.
