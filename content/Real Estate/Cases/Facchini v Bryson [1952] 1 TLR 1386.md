# Facchini v Bryson [1952] 1 TLR 1386

The Court of Appeal held that upon the proper interpretation of a document under which the defendant, an ex-employee of the plaintiffs, occupied premises, it was a lease and not a licence, and that parties could not turn a lease into a licence merely by stating that the document was to be deemed to be a licence.
