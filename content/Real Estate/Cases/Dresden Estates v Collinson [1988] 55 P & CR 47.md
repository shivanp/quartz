# Dresden Estates v Collinson [1988] 55 P & CR 47

## Abstract

P purported to grant to D a "licence" to occupy a workshop and store. The written agreement provided inter alia that, "this licence is personal to the licensees"; that "this licence confers no exclusive right for the licensees to use and occupy the premises, and the licensor will be entitled from time to timeâ€¦to require the licensees to transfer their occupation to other premises within the licensor's adjoining property"; and that "the licensor may by giving the required notice to the licensees increase the licence fee to such amount as may be specified in the notice." The agreement also provided that the "licensees" should permit the "licensor with necessary workmen, contractors and equipment to enter upon the premises to carry out any work deemed necessary." D, who relied in particular upon the limited right of entry conferred by the agreement on P, contended that the effect of the agreement was to create a tenancy, and the judge so held.

Held, allowing P's appeal, that on the true construction of this unusual agreement P's entitlement to require the "licensees" to transfer to other premises was wholly inconsistent with a right to exclusive possession during the continuation of the agreement, and was therefore wholly inconsistent with a tenancy. The agreement accordingly conferred a licence only (_[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=64a1067bee4a4540818f40f2f1b4d40d&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Addiscombe Garden Estates v Crabbe [1957] 2 Q.B. 615, [1957] 4 WLUK 32](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I53328C11E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=64a1067bee4a4540818f40f2f1b4d40d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Shell-Mex and BP Ltd v Manchester Garages [1971] 1 W.L.R. 612, [1971] 1 WLUK 473](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA79F9851E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=64a1067bee4a4540818f40f2f1b4d40d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).

Per curiam: The indicia which may make it more apparent in the case of a residential tenant or occupier that he is indeed a tenant may be less applicable or less likely to have that effect in the case of some business tenancies.
