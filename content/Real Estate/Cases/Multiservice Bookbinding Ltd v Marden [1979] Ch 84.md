# Multiservice Bookbinding Ltd v Marden [1979] Ch 84

#key-case

Facts: A borrower company mortgaged its premises to a private individual. One term of the loan was that the level of repayments would be linked to the value of the Swiss franc. This meant that if the value of the pound fell against the franc, the repayments would be much more expensive as it would cost more to ‘buy’ sufficient francs to pay each instalment. This protected the lender’s investment because if the instalment was, say, the equivalent of 150 francs, that is what the lender received. The pound duly fell, and the borrower claimed that the term was void.

Held: Browne-Wilkinson LJ said that a mortgage term would be unconscionable if it were imposed in a ‘morally reprehensible manner… which affects [the lender’s] conscience’. Here, there was no unconscionability. There was equality of bargaining power and the borrower had simply entered into what turned out to be a bad bargain with its eyes open.

## Abstract

A collateral stipulation in a mortgage which does not clog the equity is only objectionable if it is unfair and unconscionable, i.e. imposed in a morally reprehensible manner, not merely if it is unreasonable. M lent P GBP 36,000 secured by a mortgage in 1966. Cl.6 of the mortgage linked repayment to the Swiss franc which at the date of the loan was worth less than 9p. When P wished to redeem the mortgage in 1976, the Swiss franc was worth 25p, thus trebling the amount of sterling required for redemption. P contended that the clause was void either on the grounds that it was contrary to public policy, or that it was unconscionable and a clog on the equity.

Held, that the clause was not contrary to public policy; it was not a clog on the equity of redemption, and both parties had been of equal bargaining power, so, whilst possibly unreasonable, such a term was not unconscionable. The court could not rewrite an improvident contract, and the term would have to stand.
