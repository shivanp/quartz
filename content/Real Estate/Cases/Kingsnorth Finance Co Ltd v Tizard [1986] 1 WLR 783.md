# Kingsnorth Finance Co Ltd v Tizard [1986] 1 WLR 783

**FACTS**: Mr Tizard, the first defendant, held the legal title of the **unregistered** matrimonial home (Willowdown House) on trust for himself and his wife, the second defendant. The marriage broke down and Mrs Tizard moved out of the matrimonial home. She returned to the house in the mornings and evenings to look after the twin children; getting them ready for school and cooking them meals. She kept her clothing in three of the four wardrobe compartments in the master bedroom, and also kept toiletries and a dressing gown at the property. She would also stay in the house overnight when Mr Tizard was away on business.

Mr Tizard negotiated a loan secured by a legal mortgage with the plaintiff finance company. On the application form for the loan, Mr Tizard described himself as single. When the plaintiff finance company sent a surveyor to inspect the property, Mr Tizard apologised for the state of the property and explained that he was married but that his wife had left him and was no longer living at the property.

The surveyor made no further enquiries and, on the basis of his report, the loan was agreed and paid to Mr Tizard alone, therefore **not overreaching Mrs Tizard's equitable interest**. Mr Tizard later emigrated to America with the boy twin and defaulted on the loan.

The court had to consider if Mrs Tizard’s equitable interest in the property under the trust was binding on the plaintiff finance company. Was the finance company Equity's Darling and therefore not subject to Mrs Tizard's equitable interest?

**HELD:** The finance company had imputed notice of Mrs Tizard's equitable interest through the constructive notice of its surveyor. Although the surveyor did not actually know of Mrs Tizard's interest, it would have been reasonable for him to make further enquiries based on what he did know. The finance company were therefore bound by the equitable interest.

Judge John Finlay QC said:

> "… The fact that Mr. Marshall (the surveyor) _was looking for evidence of the occupation of a female cohabitee coupled with what I infer from the two documents signed by Mr. Tizard was Bradshaw's_ (the surveyor company's) understanding of Mr. Tizard's marital status, implies that Mr. Marshall approached his inspection on the footing that Mr. Tizard was not married; when it appeared that he was, I consider that he had a duty to communicate this new information to his principals. It follows in my judgment that the knowledge of the agent, Mr. Marshall, that Mr. Tizard had a wife is to be taken to be the knowledge of the principal, the plaintiffs.
>
> …Primarily, the plaintiffs are to be taken to have been aware that Mr. Tizard was married and had described himself as single; and in these circumstances their further inquiries should have led them to Mrs. Tizard…"

A wife who is separated from her husband but spends some part of virtually every day in the matrimonial home remains in occupation. A purchaser or mortgagee needs to carry out a full inspection of property in order to discover who other than a husband is in occupation, and has to look behind the husband's attempted concealment of his wife's occupation.

The marriage between a husband and wife broke down and the wife left the matrimonial home but returned there regularly, including sleeping there when the husband was away. The house was in the husband's name. The husband approached mortgage brokers to obtain a loan of GBP 66,000 on the security of the house which was unregistered land. He signed the application form and stated that he was single. The brokers instructed a surveyor to carry out a survey and the husband arranged a time on a Sunday when the wife was away. The surveyor saw evidence of the occupation by the husband and his children, but no evidence of occupation by any other female. The husband told the surveyor that his wife had left many months ago, and was living with someone nearby.

The plaintiffs made a loan offer which was accepted in the light of the surveyor's report. Shortly after, the husband and son emigrated. The plaintiffs sought to enforce their charge and the question arose whether the charge was subject to or overrode the wife's equitable interest. The plaintiffs contended that mere occupation in the case of unregistered land was not sufficient to protect a person claiming equitable rights against a purchaser or mortgagee of the legal estate unless the claimant was found in occupation or would have been found on proper inspection taking place. It was common ground that the surveyor was the plaintiffs' agent.

Held, that for physical presence to amount to actual occupation it did not have to be either exclusive or continuous and uninterrupted. Nor was it negatived by regular or repeated absence. Since on the facts the wife spent some part of virtually every day in the former matrimonial home, it was clear she had been in occupation and her change of habits had not altered that (dictum of Lord Wilberforce in _[Williams & Glyn's Bank Ltd v Boland [1981] A.C. 487, [1980] 6 WLUK 211](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I01451E70E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3c5453c0a06541a29d4286bd74749ea5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied). When the surveyor discovered that the husband was married but separated he was under a duty to look for signs of occupation and to tell the plaintiffs. In any event, the reference in the report to the "son and daughter" itself should have put the plaintiffs on further inquiry which would have led them to discover the wife's beneficial interest by virtue of the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.199(1)(ii)(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I398D49F1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3c5453c0a06541a29d4286bd74749ea5&contextData=(sc.Default)) .

They had knowledge of her beneficial interest and the mortgage took effect subject to those rights. The husband's attempt to conceal the wife's occupation could not be relied on by the plaintiff as preventing the need for further inquiry. Where a purchaser or mortgagee made reasonable inquiries and inspections and did not find the claimant in occupation or evidence sufficient to give notice of it, they were not fixed with notice of the claimant's rights. In the case of residential property what was a reasonable inspection depended on all the circumstances. On the facts, the plaintiffs' pre-arranged inspection on a Sunday afternoon was not within the category of "such…inspections…as ought reasonably to have been made" under s.199(1)(ii) of the 1925 Act. The plaintiffs' claim for possession was dismissed.
