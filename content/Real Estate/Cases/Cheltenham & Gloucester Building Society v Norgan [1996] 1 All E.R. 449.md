# Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society v Norgan [1996] 1 All E.R. 449

N appealed against the district judge's decision to refuse to suspend the issue of a warrant for possession of her farmhouse. N had borrowed GBP 90,000 from CGB but had fallen into arrears. Although CBG's standard terms provided that if any instalment should be in arrears and unpaid they would be entitled to take possession, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, of which CGB was a member, aimed where possible to help borrowers who encountered difficulties. The warrant was initially suspended by a series of orders relating to payment of current interest instalments and paying off of arrears, but N had failed to comply with them. The [Administration of Justice Act 1970 s.36](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF860C280E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3a4cc490a92640258ad391fc6f729457&contextData=(sc.Search)) and the [Administration of Justice Act 1973 s.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2A1648E0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3a4cc490a92640258ad391fc6f729457&contextData=(sc.Search)) had the effect of allowing the court, in the exercise of its discretion to suspend possession orders, to treat the sum due under the mortgage as being only the arrears of instalments or interest if the mortgagor was likely to be able to pay off all the arrears within a reasonable period. The question for the court to decide was what was a "reasonable period" within the 1970 Act s.36(1).

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) the starting point for a reasonable period should be the outstanding term of the mortgage. It should then be determined whether the mortgagor could maintain the paying off of the arrears by instalments over that period, _[First Middlesbrough Trading and Mortgage Co Ltd v Cunningham (1974) 28 P. & C.R. 69, [1974] 2 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA6ECB880E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3a4cc490a92640258ad391fc6f729457&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Western Bank Ltd v Schindler [1977] Ch. 1, [1976] 3 WLUK 26](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF8461C20E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3a4cc490a92640258ad391fc6f729457&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered;

(2) this approach would require detailed analysis, by district judges, of budgets and future projections to determine whether the mortgagor would be able to meet the payments and when the mortgagee's security would be put at risk by postponement of arrears, and

(3) the following considerations were relevant when determining a "reasonable period":  
(a) how much can the mortgagor afford to pay both now and in the future?  
(b) how long are the mortgagor's temporary difficulties in meeting their obligations likely to last?  
(c) why have arrears accumulated?  
(d) how much of the original term is left?  
(e) when is the principal due to be repaid?  
(f) should the court exercise its power to disregard accelerated payment provisions under the 1973 Act s.8?  
(g) is it reasonable to expect the mortgagor to recoup the arrears of interest either over the whole of the original term, or within a shorter period, or within a longer period? Is it reasonable to expect the mortgagor to capitalise the interest?  
(h) does anything, affecting the security, influence the length of the period for payment?
