# Yeung v Patel [2014] EWCA Civ 481

## Summary

Despite a mismatch between the easements and the reservations clauses in leases of adjoining flats, an argument that additional words should be implied to make them compatible failed the test of necessity.

## Abstract

The appellant owner (Y) of a flat appealed against a decision awarding damages for trespass and nuisance to the respondent owners (P) of the flat above and dismissing his counterclaim for damages and for an injunction allowing him access to P's flat to turn off the gas supply.

When the four-storey property was converted into flats, new joists and a ceiling were installed below the floor joists of P's flat. The leases to both flats demised the respective floor joists below and the ceilings above but not the joists to which the ceilings were attached. In the course of major building works, Y removed his ceilings and attached a metal frame intended to support a new ceiling on the underside of the floor joists of P's flat above, thereby gaining extra height in his rooms. Y also wanted to move the gas supply pipes into the space between the joists of P's floor and sought an injunction to gain access to P's flat to turn off P's gas supply while he reconnected the new supply pipes. The easements and privileges clause in each lease allowed each leaseholder the right to enter other parts of the building to maintain old, and lay new, pipes. The judge found that by removing his ceiling and installing a ceiling at a higher level Y had trespassed on P's property and his works had caused extensive damage and nuisance to P. Y's counterclaim was dismissed.

Y contended that  
(1) on the true construction of the leases he had a right to lay pipes between P's floor joists and to access P's flat;  
(2) the space between Y's original ceiling and P's floor formed part of the demise of his flat.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) There was a mismatch between the easements and privileges clause, which allowed the laying of new pipes, and the reservations clause, which only allowed renewal of existing pipes. Y was wrong to maintain that the words "or laying new" should be implied into the reservations clauses to resolve the mismatch, because there was a heavy burden on a party alleging an implied reservation, _[Wheeldon v Burrows (1879) 12 Ch.

"Renewing" pipes meant substituting new pipes or wires as replacements for the pre-existing ones, _[Lurcott v Wakeley & Wheeler [1911] 1 K.B. 905, [1911] 2 WLUK 60](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE85D3150E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=16d089aea98e4d398a150ceb7cb88cbf&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. It did not extend to laying new and additional pipes or wires of a different character from the pre-existing ones, _[Trailfinders v Razuki [1988] 30 E.G. 59, [1988] 1 WLUK 543](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA57A6600E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=16d089aea98e4d398a150ceb7cb88cbf&contextData=(sc.Default))_ approved. Even though the additional words were sensible, and even desirable, they fell short of the test of necessity so Y had no right to enter P's flat to turn off the gas (paras [48-49, 68](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(2) Although it was unclear exactly who owned the space above Y's original ceiling and the bottom of P's floor joints, it did not belong to Y and he had no right to occupy it (para.[54](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
