# C Putnam and Sons v Taylor [2009] EWCH 317 (Ch)

## Summary

The court exercised its discretion to enforce a charging order over a joint tenant's beneficial interest in property where the joint tenants had not altered their respective beneficial interests before the charging order had been registered and it would have been inequitable to keep the creditor out of the money to which it was entitled indefinitely.

## Abstract

The applicant creditor (P) applied for the enforcement of a final charging order for possession and sale of a property belonging to the first and second respondents (H and W).

H and W, a married couple, were registered as joint proprietors of their family home. H had engaged P, a contractor, to carry out various demolition works, leading to an adjudication in November 2003 against H. That, in turn, led to a judgment against H and, in February 2005, to a charging order for the sum owing under the judgment in respect of H's share of the property at issue. In a letter of January 2006, H and W agreed that W, who claimed to have paid the majority of the household outgoings and had strongly disagreed with H's business activities, would become the sole beneficial owner of the property.

W submitted that the court should exercise it discretion not to enforce the charging order on the basis that she was the sole beneficial owner of the property and that it would be unfair to her to order a sale because H's debt, which had brought about the charging order, had arisen as a result of H's high-risk business activities of which she had not approved. W also claimed that an order for sale would infringe her rights under the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I13AEBA7190CB4FD6878845F048D2A987/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=80ec49940bfb48b08bf469f634ac5252&contextData=(sc.Search)) and [Protocol 1 art.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC7CE4DF876E440C491BF5D88ED57F7DB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=80ec49940bfb48b08bf469f634ac5252&contextData=(sc.Search)).

## Held

Application granted.

(1) In the circumstances, any change in H and W's beneficial interests brought about by the letter of January 2006 was subject to the charging order, which had already been registered at that time. The original purchase of the property was deemed to be as beneficial joint tenants, and it was not possible to conclude that, before January 2006, there was an inferred or imputed intention of the kind necessary to alter the beneficial interests in the property which had crystallised initially upon acquisition in 1979. The effect of the charging order was to sever the joint beneficial interest so that the shares were held, from that point on, equally as tenants in common.

(2) The power to enforce a charging order was compatible with the 1950 Convention, since it was in accordance with the law, _[Close Invoice Finance Ltd v Pile [2008] EWHC 1580 (Ch), [2009] 1 F.L.R. 873, [2008] 5 WLUK 445](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA58206C0D16F11DD9C50F38D532F9868/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=80ec49940bfb48b08bf469f634ac5252&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. In considering whether to exercise its discretion to enforce the charging order, under the [Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 s.15(1)(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID7917D40E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=80ec49940bfb48b08bf469f634ac5252&contextData=(sc.Search)), regard was to be had to the intentions of the persons who created the trust. H and W's intention had been to provide a family home. It was also necessary to strike a balance between the various competing interests; in that respect, P should not be kept out of the money to which it was entitled indefinitely and there was no prospect whatsoever that it would be paid otherwise than out of H's share. Moreover, there was enough equity in the property after the discharge of the charging order to provide another home for H and W, albeit a smaller one, _[Mortgage Corp v Shaire [2001] Ch. 743, [2000] 2 WLUK 920](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I05C67D51E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=80ec49940bfb48b08bf469f634ac5252&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages Ltd v Bell [2001] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 920, [2000] 12 WLUK 77](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6ECD3291E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=80ec49940bfb48b08bf469f634ac5252&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. The proper exercise of the court's discretion therefore required an order for sale. However, a period of several months was allowed before possession would be ordered to give H and W the opportunity to conclude a private sale and find an alternative property.
