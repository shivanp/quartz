# Goodman v Gallant [1986] Fam 106

**FACTS:** Mr Goodman bought a house in his sole name in 1960 and declared that he held it for himself and Mrs Goodman as beneficial joint tenants. When Mr Goodman left in 1971, Mrs Goodman and her new partner, Mr Gallant, bought his interest and declared themselves beneficial joint tenants. Mrs Goodman severed the joint tenancy and claimed 75%.

**HELD:**

Despite claiming a 75% share as tenant in common, Mrs Goodman was awarded 50% on the basis that an equal share results on severance.

Thus, if there had been four joint tenants, Mrs Goodman would have taken 25% as tenant in common, and the other three would continue as joint tenants with 75%.

**SLADE LJ**:

> ‘…it seems to us that it is of the very nature of a joint tenancy that, upon a severance, each takes an equal aliquot share according to the number of joint tenants.

Where a conveyance into joint names contains an express declaration that the parties are to hold the proceeds of sale on trust for themselves as joint tenants, then on severance a tenancy in common in equal shares is created, and the declaration is conclusive of the position. In 1960 P and her husband purchased a house which was conveyed into the sole name of the husband, although it was agreed between them that P was entitled to a half share in the beneficial interest in the property. In 1971 P left the husband and later began living in the property with D. In 1978 the husband, in consideration of the cost of his share, conveyed the freehold to P and D as beneficial joint tenants of trust for sale "to hold the net proceeds of sale…UPON TRUST for themselves as joint tenants." In 1983 P severed the joint tenancy and issued a summons for the determination of their respective beneficial interests, contending that she was entitled to threequarters of the beneficial interest on the basis that she already owned one-half and it was intended that the joint tenancy should only extend to the half share she received from the husband. The registrar held that they held as tenants in common in equal shares, and the judge, on appeal by the plaintiff, upheld this decision. P further appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that where a conveyance into joint names contained an express declaration of trust that the parties were to hold the proceeds of sale of the property on trust for themselves as joint tenants, then on severance of the tenancy, a tenancy in common in equal shares was created. Furthermore, the doctrine of resulting implied or constructive trusts could not be invoked where there was an express declaration which comprehensively declared what were the beneficial interests in the property or its proceeds of sale since such a declaration was exhaustive and conclusive of the position unless and until the conveyance was set aside or rectified. D was therefore entitled to a half share of the beneficial interest in the property (_[Wilson v Wilson (Matrimonial Home) [1963] 1 W.L.R. 601, [1963] 4 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I01F3D500E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aa8b78cb525d43a182bd03f824e53944&contextData=(sc.Default))_, dicta of Lord Upjohn in Pettitt v Pettitt [1969] C.L.Y. 1639, [1969] 2 All E.R. at 405 ; of Lord Diplock in Gissing v Gissing [1970] C.L.Y. 1243, [1970] 2 All E.R. at 789 ; _[Leake (formerly Bruzzi) v Bruzzi [1974] 1 W.L.R. 1528, [1974] 4 WLUK 67](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IDF577840E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aa8b78cb525d43a182bd03f824e53944&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Pink v Lawrence (1978) 36 P. & C.R. 98, [1977] 11 WLUK 215](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I22D7E550E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=aa8b78cb525d43a182bd03f824e53944&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed.
