# Mills v Silver (1991) Ch 271, CA

FACTS: Access to a farm was gained over a track on adjoining land from 1922 by the claimants and their predecessors. The track was used between 1922 and 1981 whenever it was dry enough, with the landowners’ knowledge. No express permission was ever granted. The claimants used the track infrequently between 1981 and 1985. In 1987 they tried to lay stone along the track to make it passable in all weather. The landowners sued for trespass and the claimants claimed an easement by prescription.

HELD: The court held that the use was enough to form the basis of a claim for an easement by prescription – the right had been used ‘reasonably regularly’ and the track had been used without force, secrecy or permission.
