# Chaudhary v Yavuz [2011] EWCA Civ 1314

## Summary

A judge had erred in finding that a property owner was entitled to a right of way over an adjoining property which had been sold without the right being incorporated into the contract for sale or registered, as there had been no actual occupation of the property such as to constitute an overriding interest under the [Land Registration Act 2002 Sch.3 para.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I383A6420E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d3c0c5c3dd1644c9b93aee142e4ae9c8&contextData=(sc.Search)) and no right on the basis of an easement by estoppel by way of a constructive trust.

## Abstract

The appellant (Y) appealed against a decision that the respondent (C) was entitled to a right of way over his property.

C and Y owned neighbouring properties, numbers 37 and 35 respectively. An alleyway between the properties was included in the title to number 35. Prior to Y owning number 35, C had paid for the construction of a metal stairway in the alleyway which provided access to the first floors of both properties. When Y bought number 35, the contract incorporated the Standard Conditions of Sale, with a provision resolving any conflict in favour of the agreement. The property was sold "subject to the Incumbrances on the Property", with incumbrances defined as entries in the Property and Charges Registers. There were no relevant entries in the register. Y removed the connection between the staircase and number 37. C sought a declaration that he was entitled to a right of way over the staircase. The judge held that the metal structure was discoverable by inspection so as to give notice that there might be rights of access from the upper floors of number 37 to the street and back, so that those rights fell within Standard Condition 3.1.2(b). He held that C had been in actual occupation of part of number 35, so that the right was an overriding interest and that, even if that was incorrect, C was entitled to an easement by estoppel as the right was binding by way of a constructive trust. He regarded it as unconscionable for Y to deny C the right of way.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) There was no actual occupation of any part of the metal structure which could give C's rights the status of an overriding interest. The use identified by the judge did not amount to actual occupation (see paras [27-36](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The incorporation of the Standard Conditions of Sale in a contract for the sale of land had to be a very widespread practice. Most such contracts were therefore expressed to be subject to incumbrances discoverable by inspection of the property before the contract. If the relevant incumbrance was protected by actual occupation, within the terms of the [Land Registration Act 2002 Sch.3 para.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I383A6420E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d3c0c5c3dd1644c9b93aee142e4ae9c8&contextData=(sc.Search)), then it would bind the purchaser in any event. However, if it was any other form of right, such as an equitable easement or other proprietary estoppel right, then the judge's reasoning would make it binding on the purchaser despite the fact that it could, and in terms of the 2002 Act should, be protected by registration or a notice on the register, and despite the fact that, unlike the position in _[Lyus v Prowsa Developments Ltd [1982] 1 W.L.R. 1044, [1981] 12 WLUK 240](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE89C0F10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d3c0c5c3dd1644c9b93aee142e4ae9c8&contextData=(sc.Search))_, there was nothing in the contract to draw specific attention to it. That would not satisfy the test laid down in _[Lloyd v Dugdale [2001] EWCA Civ 1754, [2002] 2 P. & C.R. 13, [2001] 11 WLUK 522](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE1F099B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d3c0c5c3dd1644c9b93aee142e4ae9c8&contextData=(sc.Search))_. There was nothing in the contract which would allow the court to conclude that the purchaser "has undertaken a new obligation, not otherwise existing, to give effect to the relevant encumbrance or prior interest". That criterion should be applied in a case of the instant kind and, if applied, would lead to the conclusion that Y's conscience was not bound to give effect to C's asserted rights, Dugdale applied, Lyus distinguished (paras [57-62](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) In the absence of any express reference in the contract to the rights asserted by C and an express provision requiring the purchaser to take the property subject to those rights, it was not sufficient that the metal structure was apparent on inspection of the land, and that it would have been apparent that it served as an access for the upper floors of both properties. Y had not bought the property on the basis that no changes would be made. The contract was silent in that regard. Y became the owner of everything comprised in the title to number 35 and it was open to him to do whatever he chose, subject to any third party rights that were binding on him and restrictions such as those of the planning legislation. Unless there were third party rights over the metal structure which were binding on him, it was open to him to remove all or any part of the structure (paras [69-70](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) The rights asserted by C were not binding on Y and the order would be set aside.
