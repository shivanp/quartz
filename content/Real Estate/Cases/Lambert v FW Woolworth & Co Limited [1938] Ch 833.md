# Lambert v FW Woolworth & Co Limited [1938] Ch 833

The Court of Appeal, Civil Division, held that the question of whether or not an alteration was an improvement within the [Landlord and Tenant Act 1927](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251927_36a_Title%25&A=0.7667133043592398&backKey=20_T483767037&service=citation&ersKey=23_T483766793&langcountry=GB) should be considered from the point of view of the tenant. In the instant case, the proposed alteration (including pulling down the back wall of the shop on the demised premises and moving the main staircase) had been improvements. The question of improvement should be limited to an improvement of the demised property. The onus of proving that the withholding by the lessors of their consent had been unreasonable was upon the tenant. If, however, the lessors merely refused, but had given no reason for so doing, the onus was upon him to show that his action had been reasonable.
