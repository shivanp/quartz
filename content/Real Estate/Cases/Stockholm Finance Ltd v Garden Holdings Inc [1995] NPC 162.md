# Stockholm Finance Ltd v Garden Holdings Inc [1995] NPC 162

S was the mortgagee of property belonging to G. G was wholly owned by M who, along with her mother, was a guarantor of the mortgage. S had obtained possession against G on the grounds of arrears and now sought possession against the two guarantors. The guarantors claimed that the property had been charged without their consent and therefore the charge could not be enforced against them.

Held, allowing the application, that S was entitled to possession against the guarantors. They had transferred the property to G with informed consent with the intention that G would own the house and the guarantors would have the benefit of shares. There were no special rules of law applicable to family property.
