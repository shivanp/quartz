# Kenny v Preen [1963] 1 QB 499

1. Though a mere challenge to the tenant's title does not constitute a breach of his covenant for quiet enjoyment, intimidation and persecution may, at any rate if combined with knocking on the door and shouting threats.
2. Punitive damages cannot be given for such a breach if the claim is in contract only. A landlord pursued a persistent course of intimidation and persecution of his tenant, knocking on the door and shouting threats at her, and threatening to evict her. The county court judge awarded GBP 100 damages for breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment.

Held, on appeal, that on the facts there was conduct capable of amounting to a breach, but that nominal damages of 40s. only could be awarded.

A landlord gave his tenant a notice to quit. He threatened to take physical action to evict the tenant and remove her belongings through letters, by shouting at her and banging at her door. The tenant brought an action against the landlord for damages for breach of his covenant for quiet enjoyment, for an injunction to restrain the landlord from further interference with her quiet enjoyment of the premises and for a declaration that her tenancy was protected by the Rent Acts. The Court of Appeal held that the landlord’s conduct amounted to direct physical interference with the tenant’s enjoyment of the premises, and it interfered with the tenant’s proper freedom of action in exercising her right of possession. Thus, landlord breached his covenant for quiet enjoyment and an injunction was rightly granted. However, the county court had no jurisdiction to grant the declaration sought as it was not ancillary to the judgment for damages for breach of the covenant.
