# Payne v Cardiff [1932] 1 KB 241

A local authority carried out street improvements. The premises became charged, under s 13(1) of the Private Street Works Act 1892, with the sum apportioned to them in respect of the improvements. That sum was ordered to be paid by instalments. The King's Bench Division held that there was nothing in [s 101](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251925_20a_SECT_101%25&A=0.10803269584038244&backKey=20_T452237312&service=citation&ersKey=23_T452236999&langcountry=GB) of the Law of Property Act 1925 to prevent a mortgagee from exercising his power of sale when part only of the mortgage debt became due, and where a mortgage debt was payable in instalments, the right to enforce payment arose as each instalment became due. Thus, in the instant case, the local authority, under the powers conferred by s 13(1) of the 1892 Act and s 101 of the 1925 Act, had the power to sell the premises, not merely when the whole of the apportioned sum was due, but also when an instalment was in default.
