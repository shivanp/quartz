# Gore and Snell v Carpenter [1990] 60 P&CR 456

**FACTS:** Mr and Mrs Carpenter owned two houses as beneficial joint tenants, living in one. After they separated, Mrs Carpenter lived in the other. From July 1986 until Mr Carpenter’s died in 1987 negotiations took place as to the division of the assets. Mrs Carpenter had agreed in principle to each party taking one property absolutely, but a final agreement was not reached as there were outstanding matters to agree. Mr Carpenter did not serve notice in writing as he felt that this could be construed as a hostile act. On his death, the question arose as to whether the joint tenancies had been severed. If they had, Mrs Snell took his share of each property under his will.

**HELD:** Despite looking carefully at whether there was a notice in writing, or a unilateral act by Mr Carpenter, or mutual agreement or conduct, the court could find nothing which could be said to have severed the joint tenancies.

Focusing on the ongoing negotiations, and possible severance by mutual conduct, Blackett-Ord J referred to the remarks of Sir John Pennycuick in *Burgess v Rawnsley* to the effect that it is possible in certain circumstances to infer from negotiations a common intention to sever, even if those negotiations are ultimately inconclusive. He explained how he arrived at the conclusion that in the Carpenters’ case, there had been no ‘mutual conduct’.

BLACKETT-ORD J:

> ‘Then was there a course of dealing? There were negotiations, as I have said, but negotiations are not the same thing as a course of dealing. A course of dealing is where over the years the parties have dealt with their interests in the property on the footing that they are interests in common and not joint. […]
>
> But in the present case there were simply negotiations between the husband and the wife and again there was no finality and there was no mutuality. For severance to be effected by a course of dealing all joint tenants must be concerned in such a course and in the present case there is no evidence that Mrs Carpenter was committing herself to accepting a tenancy in common…'

Negotiations between a husband and wife with a view to settling claims for ancillary relief in divorce proceedings were ineffective to sever a joint tenancy between the parties in the absence of a concluded agreement between them. P were the executors of the estate of the husband, who committed suicide in January 1987. At the time of his death he and D, his wife, owned two properties as joint tenants. The marriage broke down in September 1985 and in November 1985 H and W were living in separate properties. In July 1986 H's solicitors wrote to W's solicitors proposing that the parties should divorce, offering to provide a confession statement for a divorce on the ground of adultery and seeking out proposals for the resolution of the parties' ensuing claims for financial relief. Agreement was reached in principle that one of the properties should be transferred to H and the other to W but no concluded agreement was reached. W served her divorce petition in December 1986, claiming ancillary relief. Notwithstanding his solicitor's advice, H refused to serve notices severing their equitable joint tenancies in the properties. After H's death P issued proceedings to determine whether H's interest in the two properties passed to W by survivorship or to his estate.

Held, that H could not have effected a severance by dealing with his own share in the properties by releasing it to his co-tenant. Severance could only be effected by dealings with a third party. There was no express agreement to sever their joint tenancies nor could severance be shown from a course of dealings between them. The negotiations were not a course of dealing. There was no evidence of finality or mutuality and no evidence of an acceptance by W of a tenancy in common prior to the division of the properties that would have been made in the divorce proceedings. It was not possible to infer a common intention to sever from the negotiations as the wife had not committed herself to any agreement at that stage.
