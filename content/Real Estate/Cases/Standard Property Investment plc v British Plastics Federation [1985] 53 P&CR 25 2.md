# Standard Property Investment plc v British Plastics Federation [1985] 53 P&CR 25 2

**FACTS:** A Class F land charge was registered against Erskine Alleyne. His full name, as appearing in the title deeds, was Erskine Owen Alleyne.

**HELD:** A clear search against the full name allowed a later mortgagee to take free from the spouseâ€™s right of occupation, as the Class F land charge was void.

The words "name of the estate owner" in the [Land Charges Act 1972 s.3(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1E440251E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b7f1119e1a984e87898156e394162674&contextData=(sc.Search)) means the name as disclosed by the conveyance. In 1980 a house was conveyed to two people named as Roger Caudrelier and Hilary Caudrelier. The couple mortgaged the property to the plaintiff who registered a charge in those names. The couple then took out another mortgage with the defendant who searched in the names of Roger Denis and Hilary Claire Caudrelier. The search did not reveal the earlier mortgage. On the sale of the property the plaintiff claimed priority.

Held, that the words "name of the estate owner" meant the name as disclosed by the conveyance. The plaintiff's mortgage was properly so registered and his mortgage had priority.
