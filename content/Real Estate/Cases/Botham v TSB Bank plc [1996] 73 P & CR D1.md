# Botham v TSB Bank plc [1996] 73 P & CR D1

#key-case

**Facts:** The mortgagee took possession of Mr Botham’s flat and sold it, including the contents. Mr Botham argued that many items were chattels, not fixtures, and so he should be given credit for them from the proceeds. Roch LJ looked at each item in turn and assessed which were fixtures and which were chattels.

**Held:**

LJ Roch confirmed the two tests as being:

1. The method and degree and annexation;
2. The object and purpose of the annexation.

And stated…

> ‘_if the item viewed objectively, is, intended to be permanent and to afford a lasting improvement to the building, the thing will have become a fixture. If the attachment is temporary and is no more than is necessary for the item to be used and enjoyed, then it will remain a chattel_.’

This case is an informative one in relation to the status of household objects and shows that each object must be viewed on its own merits.
