# Rugby School (Governors) v Tannahill [1935] 1 KB 87

The lessee committed a breach of her covenant not to use the premises for illegal or immoral purposes. The lessor served her a notice to quit which did not require her to remedy the breach nor to make compensation in money under [s 146(1)(b) and (c)](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/search/enhRunRemoteLink.do?linkInfo=F%23GB%23UK_LEG%23num%251925_20a_SECT_146%25&A=0.5600561034437417&backKey=20_T485422418&service=citation&ersKey=23_T485422409&langcountry=GB) of the Law of Property Act 1925. The Court of Appeal held that the breach was not remedied by ceasing to commit the breach, as the breach was not capable of remedy. The omission in the notice did not invalidate it to require it to be remedied. The notice was not invalidated by the omission to require payment of compensation in money, although the breach was incapable of remedy, because if the lessor did not require compensation, it need not ask for it.

Panel: Greer, Maugham and Roche LJJ

Statute: Law of Property Act 1925 (LPA 1925) s 146

**FACTS**: The claimant landlords owned a property in Great Ormond Street in London. They granted a lease of the property to Mr Reason, who later assigned the lease (with the consent of the landlord) to Ms Tannahill, the defendant. The lease contained a covenant by the tenant not to use the property for illegal or immoral purposes, which the tenant breached by using the property for prostitution, for which she was convicted. The landlord served a notice on her terminating the lease in accordance with the LPA 1925 s 146(1). The s 146 notice did not require her to remedy the breach or to provide compensation to the landlord. The tenant stopped using the property for prostitution. She argued that the s 146 notice was invalid, as it did not require her to remedy the breach or to pay compensation to the landlord. The judge at first instance found in favour of the claimant and held that the notice was valid. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

**LORD JUSTICE GREER** …The question depends upon whether or not the notice which was served upon her by the plaintiffs sufficiently complies with the requirements of s. 146, sub-s. 1 of the Law of Property Act, 1925…

The covenant, the breach of which is complained of, expressly forbids the tenant to permit the premises to be used for such [an immoral] purpose. …In those circumstances, the plaintiffs were entitled to obtain possession of the premises unless they failed to comply with the terms of s. 146 of the Law of Property Act, 1925. …

The first point is, whether this particular breach is capable of remedy. In my judgment, [the judge at first instance] was right in coming to the conclusion that it was not. … [I]n some cases where the immediate ceasing of that which is complained of, together with an undertaking against any further breach, it might be said that the breach was capable of remedy. This particular breach, however – conducting the premises, or permitting them to be conducted, as a house of ill-fame – is one which in my judgment was not remedied by merely stopping this user. I cannot conceive how a breach of this kind can be remedied. The result of committing the breach would be known all over the neighbourhood and seriously affect the value of the premises. Even a money payment together with the cessation of the improper use of the house could not be a remedy.

Taking the view as I do that this breach was incapable of remedy, it was unnecessary to require in the notice that the defendant should remedy the breach.

… The further question is whether the absence of any statement in the notice requiring compensation in money in respect of the breach is fatal to the validity of the notice. As to that … the plaintiffs were under no obligation to require compensation in money. … Supposing the lessor does not want compensation, is the notice to be held bad because he does not ask for it? There is no sense in that. … The appeal must be dismissed.

**HELD:** The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the defendant’s appeal. As well as taking the view that breach of an ‘immoral use’ covenant was incapable of remedy, this judgment is also of note in confirming that there is no necessity for the notice to request compensation, if compensation is not required.
