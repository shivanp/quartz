# Jeune v Queenâ€™s Cross Properties Ltd [1974] Ch 97

Where there has been a plain breach of a landlord's covenant to repair, the court has power to make an order against the landlord for specific performance of the covenant. L, the landlord, was bound by a covenant in a lease to maintain, repair and renew the structure of the property, including its external walls. L failed to reinstate a front-balcony, which had partially collapsed from the first floor. The tenants sought an order that he reinstate the balcony in its original form.

Held, that there was a plain breach of L's covenant, there was no doubt as to what need be done to remedy the breach, and an order for specific performance of the covenant would be made. (Dictum of Lord Upjohn in _[Redland Bricks v Morris [1970] A.C. 652, [1969] 5 WLUK 39](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I84F4C730E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=83f66da57dbd49bf8ddbeda42cf982a3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
