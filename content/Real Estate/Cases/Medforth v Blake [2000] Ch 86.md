# Medforth v Blake [2000] Ch 86

The receiver, managing a pig farm business, and was in breach of duty for failing to negotiate price reductions for animal feed. Feed was a major cost to the business and lack of discount had had a major impact on its profitability.

M, a pig farmer with a substantial business, had his borrowing secured by two agricultural charges containing terms permitting the bank to appoint receivers to manage or sell any of M's assets subject to either charge. B was appointed receiver manager and carried on M's business profitably at first, but later making losses. M subsequently agreed revised borrowing arrangements with his bank and claimed that B's failure to obtain bulk discounts for the purchase of pig feed constituted a breach of B's equitable duty of care as manager. Whether B owed M a duty over and above the duty of good faith was tried as a preliminary issue, and it was held that the receiver owed to M, as mortgagor, an equitable duty of care in addition to the duty of good faith when exercising the power of sale under the charge; that there was no difference between the power to sell and the power to manage when seeking to discern the duties properly applicable to either role; that the power to manage was ancillary to the power of sale, and that the equitable duty applied equally to both. B appealed, contending that the only duty owed to M by B as receiver manager was one of good faith.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the duty owed by B included, but was not limited to, a duty of good faith. A receiver's main duty was to try to engineer a situation where the debt and interest under the mortgage could be repaid. Where the receiver took on the conduct of the borrower's business, which he was not obliged to do, he had a duty to try to carry it on profitably and with due diligence, since a duty of care was owed in respect of both the power of sale and the power to manage a business, _[Cuckmere Brick Co v Mutual Finance [1971] Ch. 949, [1971] 2 WLUK 130](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I92C08940E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4df413dd93ce495e9c6fdb1f02aefebb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. Even though it was often the case that a receiver would assume management of a business with a view to its eventual sale, the ability to manage was independent and not an adjunct to the power of sale. Actions that were neither dishonest nor in any way tinged with allegations of bad faith could not amount to a breach of the duty of good faith. Negligence as a concept in such a situation must always be clearly differentiated from fraud or bad faith.
