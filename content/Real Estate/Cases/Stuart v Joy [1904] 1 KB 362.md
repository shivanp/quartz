# Stuart v Joy [1904] 1 KB 362

The defendant lessors covenanted under a lease ‘to duly complete and execute all the repairs matters and things therein stated to be within the province of the lessors’. It was decided in an arbitration that the defendants should renew some millstones. The lessees assigned their interest in the lease to the plaintiffs. The defendants declined to perform their duty as awarded, and conveyed their interest in the premises to a company. The plaintiffs then put the stones in repair. The defendants contended that the plaintiffs, not being parties to the arbitration, were not entitled to sue upon the award. They also contended that they already assigned their interest in the premises. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs, who were beneficially entitled to the lease and spent the amount necessary to carry out the award, were entitled to recover from the defendants. Further, the court assumed that the covenant to execute repairs was a covenant running with the reversion.
