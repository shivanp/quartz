# Pryce v McGuinness [1966] Qd R 591

Facts: Land was sold with no easements for drainage, sewerage or electricity granted to buyer.

Held: Claim for easements failed as drainage, sewerage and electricity not absolutely essential for enjoyment of land.

Easements will only be implied by necessity in the cases of landlocked land. In **Pryce v McGuinness** easements for drainage, sewerage and the supply of electricity were highly advantageous but not essential to be able to use the dominant land.
