# Mortgage Corporation v Shaire [2001] Ch 743

**FACTS:** A house was bought by Mr Fox and Mrs Shaire as a family home for them and Mrs Shaire’s son. Mr Fox mortgaged the property twice without Mrs Shaire’s knowledge, by forging her signature on the mortgage deed. Mr Fox fell into arrears with the mortgage payments. On his death, Mortgage Corporation applied for an order for sale under **TLATA 1996, s 14**. Neuberger J said that **s 15** had changed the law and the interests of creditors was now simply one of four factors to be considered, not the decisive factor.

**HELD:** The judge considered all of the factors in **TLATA 1996, s 15**. The purpose for which the property had been bought was as a home, but also as an asset. There were no minors to consider, as Mrs Shaire’s son was an adult. The interest of the lender amounted to 25% of the property, and Mrs Shaire held the remaining 75%.

The judge suggested two things: first, the debt due to the lender could be converted into a loan equivalent to 25% of the value of the property, on which Mrs Shaire would pay interest. This would mean that the bank would be repaid, and Mrs Shaire would be the sole owner of the property. Alternatively, an order for sale could be made.

In his judgment, the judge took great care to balance the interests of Mrs Shaire and the lender. Despite this, recent cases have once again given greater weight to the creditor.
