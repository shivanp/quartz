# Batchelor v Marlow [2003] 1 WLR 764

**FACTS:**

Marlow had a right to park six cars on commercial land belonging to Batchelor from 8.30am until 6pm from Monday to Friday each week. Batchelor argued that this use was too intense to be capable of being an easement.

At first instance the judge said that the use was limited in time and therefore did not amount to exclusive possession. The Court of Appeal applied the ‘**reasonable use**’ test, looking at the degree of use left to Batchelor.

**HELD:**

Batchelor was left with no reasonable use of the land, so the right claimed could not be an easement. The judge said that Batchelor had no reasonable use of the land either for parking during the time the spaces were likely to be needed, or for any other purpose:

> ‘His right to use his land is curtailed altogether for intermittent periods throughout the week. Such a restriction would, I think, make his ownership of the land illusory.’

## Summary

A right to park cars, on Mondays to Fridays between 9.30 am until 6.00 pm, on a strip of land owned by B was incapable of being an exclusive prescriptive easement because the use of the land was so intrusive as to render B's ownership illusory.

## Abstract

B appealed against a decision that M had acquired an exclusive prescriptive right to park up to six cars on Mondays to Fridays between the hours of 9.30 am and 6.00 pm, on a strip of land owned by B ([2001] R.T.R. 12, [2000] C.L.Y. 4630). B contended that the right was incapable of being a valid easement and that the judge's findings of fact did not justify a conclusion that such a right had been acquired. B submitted that his ownership of the land had become illusory as a result because

(1) the right asserted was exclusive of all others, including his own, and

(2) the parking on the land was so intrusive as to prevent any other use of the land being possible during periods when cars were parked. M contended that B had 120 hours of use of the land per week and that in that time he could use it for parking or charging others to park, or alternatively he could sell the land.

Held, allowing the appeal, that B had no reasonable use of the land for parking because he was unable to use it during the periods when parking spaces were most likely to be needed. His right to use the land for other purposes was restricted by the times during the week when he could not use the land, and therefore his ownership of the land was illusory. Accordingly the judge had erred in his conclusion since such a right was incapable of being an easement.
