# William Aldreds Case [1610] 9 Co Rep 57b

An action would lie where a pig-sty was erected so close to the plaintiff’s house as to corrupt the air in the house, and also and similarly for a lime-kiln with smoke, or where filth from a dye house runs into a fish pond. Where the plaintiff claims that an easement has been acquired by prescription, the defendant cannot set up another easement to destroy that easement. Though an action will lie for obstruction of light, it will not for an obstruction of a prospect:

> ‘The law does not give an action for such things of delight.’
