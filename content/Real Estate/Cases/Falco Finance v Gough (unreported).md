# Falco Finance v Gough (unreported)

A mortgage agreement permitted to the debtor to pay a discounted rate of interest, but provided that, in the event of any default in payment, the right to the discount would be permanently forfeited. The full contractual rate would then be payable. The court held that this was an extortionate credit bargain emphasising that the disproportionate increase in the interest rate was not connected with any loss suffered by the creditor.
