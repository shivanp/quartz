# Wong v Beaumont Property Trust Ltd [1965] 1 QB 173

A landlord granted a lease of basement premises to a tenant. In the lease, there were two covenants: to use the basement premises only as a restaurant; and to comply with health and safety regulations. The lease was then sold to a new tenant and the freehold sold to a new landlord.

After an inspection, it was revealed that the basement premises needed to be connected into a ventilation system on the landlordâ€™s retained land, in order to comply with Health and Safety regulations. It was essential to do this in order to continue to operate as a restaurant.

There was no easement of ventilation in the original lease, so the tenant, Wong, approached the landlord, Beaumont, who refused to allow the easement. Wong claimed that the easement should be implied into the original lease. The court allowed this.

An easement of necessity may impliedly be granted even though the parties did not realise that necessity at the time of the grant. A basement was let as a restaurant, the tenant covenanting to use the premises as a popular restaurant, to control and eliminate all smells and odours and to comply with the health regulations, one of which requires suitable ventilation. There was no such ventilation, though it was not realised at that time that a duct was necessary for this, and the tenant under the lease sued the landlord in the county court for damages and a declaration that he was entitled to erect a duct to the roof.

Held, that (a) the county court had jurisdiction, on the assumption, not disproved by the evidence, that the rateable value of neither of the properties exceeded GBP 400; (b) there was an easement of necessity and the declaration should be made.
