# Marchant v Charters [1977] 1 WLR 1181

## Abstract

In deciding whether the occupier of a room in a house is a tenant or a licensee the test is whether it was intended that he should have a stake in the room or only permission for himself personally to occupy the room, whether under contract or not.

Per curiam. Being a contractual licensee of a furnished room, C should have applied to a rent tribunal under Part VI of the Rent Act 1968. M owned a house, part of which she let off as bachelor service apartments. A housekeeper cleaned the rooms daily and provided clean linen weekly. C occupied one furnished bed-sitting room with cooking facilities. On C's application, a rent officer assessed a fair rent for the room which was confirmed by a rent assessment committee. M served notice to quit on C and claimed possession of the room. The county court judge found that C was a tenant of the room but that since it was let at a rent which included services which were "by no means minimal" it was not a protected tenancy within the [Rent Act 1968 s.1(1)(b) and s.3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID63E5B40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e7a186c23d154137838b3e595506bb2f&contextData=(sc.Search)) and he made an order for possession. C appealed.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) in view of the nature and quality of his occupation C was not a tenant but a licensee of the room and thus did not have security of tenure under the Rent Acts;

(2) that the "value of the attendance" formed a "substantial part of the whole rent" within s.2(3) of the Act, therefore by reason of s.2(1)(b) there was no protected tenancy within s.1(1).
