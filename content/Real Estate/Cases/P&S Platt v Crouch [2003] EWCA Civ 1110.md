# P&S Platt v Crouch [2003] EWCA Civ 1110

**Facts:** The Crouch family owned a hotel on the river bank in the Norfolk Broads, and an island midstream. The family and the hotel guests used to moor boats on a jetty on the shore of the island. This use of the jetty was not by way of easement, as the family owned the island. Instead, the use could be said to be a quasi-easement, which might be enjoyed by way of easement if the hotel and the island ever came to be in separate ownership.

The Crouch family sold the hotel to Platt, but retained the island. The transfer deed by which the freehold of the hotel was transferred to Platt did not contain any easement relating to the island – presumably because the Crouch family did not want the buyer or the hotel guests to use the island in future.

**Held:** The court held that the LPA 1925, s 62did not simply operate on pre-existing landlord and tenant situations; it also applied to quasi-easements which are ‘**_continuous and apparent_**’, and implied them into the transfer or lease when the land was first divided. This means that any quasi-easement which was enjoyed with the hotel was implied into the transfer deed for the benefit of Platt’s land when the hotel was sold.

## Summary

Defendants owned hotel and grounds - Claimant entered into agreement with defendants to purchase hotel business - Claimant sought declarations that they had acquired mooring rights and fishing rights under Law of Property Act 1925 s 62 - Judge was entitled to reach conclusion that rights were capable of being easements.

## Abstract

C, the former owner of a hotel, appealed against a declaration ([2002] EWHC 2195, [2002] 45 E.G.C.S. 153) that certain rights over C's retained property, an island in the nearby river, had passed to P on the transfer of the hotel by virtue of the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.62](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38E0B640E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=328551393d14415b904d27af95fa5e66&contextData=(sc.Default)) .

C contended that  
(1) the entire negotiations leading to the sale were relevant to deciding whether s.62 operated to convey those rights, and the material circumstances at the time of the sale demonstrated that it was the parties' common intention that no such rights were to pass, and  
(2) the right to use the river moorings was incapable of being an easement in that it would effectively deprive C of any reasonable user of the land.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) evidence of the negotiations was equivocal and moreover irrelevant to determining the material circumstances known to the parties at the time of the contract. The only relevant pre contract documents provided no evidence of an understanding that the mooring and ancillary rights were to cease on the sale so as to be excluded from the operation of s.62 even though the contract and transfer were silent as to such exclusion. Rather, they showed that the rights appertained to and were enjoyed with the hotel, being part of the hotel business and advertised as such and enjoyed by the hotel guests. The rights were continuous and apparent and were converted into full easements by the operation of s.62, _[Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1381, [1971] 7 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I28865D10E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=328551393d14415b904d27af95fa5e66&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Wright v Macadam [1949] 2 K.B. 744, [1949] 7 WLUK 97](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0A0D0B30E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=328551393d14415b904d27af95fa5e66&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Birmingham Dudley & District Banking Co v Ross (1888) 38 Ch. D. 295, [1888] 3 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I752C35A0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=328551393d14415b904d27af95fa5e66&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, and

(2) the right to use the river moorings was capable of being an easement, despite its adverse effect on the servient tenement. The mooring of boats and the occasional passage of hotel guests could not be said to be a sufficiently substantial interference as to deprive C of any reasonable user, nor did the reduction in value of the land render its ownership "illusory", _[Batchelor v Marlow [2001] EWCA Civ 1051, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 764, [2001] 6 WLUK 646](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70396CC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=328551393d14415b904d27af95fa5e66&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.
