# A G Securities v Vaughan [1990] 1 AC 417

**FACTS:** The occupants lived in a large flat with four bedrooms and spacious shared accommodation. The occupants, at least at first, did not know each other. They all signed separate agreements setting out the terms of their occupancy; the agreements contained different monthly payments and began at different times. The landowner reserved a right to introduce others to share the flat up to a maximum of four people.

**HELD:** The court held that the arrangement was a sensible and realistic one to provide accommodation for a _'shifting population of individuals’_ who were genuinely prepared to share the flat with others introduced from time to time who would, at least initially, be strangers to them' and therefore the occupiers **did not have exclusive possession** of the flat.

## Abstract

An agreement permitting occupation of residential premises in common with a stated number of others who might be granted a like right is capable of preventing a grant of exclusive possession where there is no joint tenancy. In the first appeal, the four occupants, by four separate agreements made on different dates, had each been granted by A Co. the exclusive right to use a four-bedroom flat in common with three other occupants who might from time to time be granted the like right. Each made monthly payments, in different amounts.

The county court judge granted a declaration that the occupants were licensees. In the second appeal, A granted to V and his girlfriend the right to use a flat. Each occupant signed separate, but identical agreements described as licences, which stated that the Rent Acts did not apply, that “the licensor is not willing to grant…exclusive possession” and that the use of the flat was “in common with the licensor and such other licensees or invitees as he may permit from time to time”. On the landlord's claim for possession, the judge held that these were tenancies within the Rent Acts. This decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal.

Held, allowing the first appeal, that there was no exclusive occupation and no joint tenancy and accordingly the occupants were licensees. Allowing the second appeal, the two agreements were interdependent, and the terms set out were a pretence designed to avoid the Rent Acts. In reality there had been an intention to grant exclusive possession and accordingly a tenancy had been created _[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; dictum of Ralph Gibson, L.J. in _[Crancour Ltd v Da Silvaesa (1986) 18 H.L.R. 265, [1986] 2 WLUK 261](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8FBF3020E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_ approved. _[Aldrington Garages Ltd v Fielder (1983) 7 H.L.R. 51, [1978] 7 WLUK 58](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I54823D90E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Facchini v Bryson [1952] 1 T.L.R. 1386, [1952] 4 WLUK 24](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FBA9040E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. _[Hadjiloucas v Crean [1988] 1 W.L.R. 1006, [1987] 7 WLUK 318](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB64A48B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd [1967] 2 Q.B. 786, [1967] 1 WLUK 724](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB010D990E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Somma v Hazelhurst [1978] 1 W.L.R. 1014, [1978] 3 WLUK 37](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB6BC27E1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Shell-Mex and BP Ltd v Manchester Garages [1971] 1 W.L.R. 612, [1971] 1 WLUK 473](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA79F9851E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Radaich v Smith 101 C.L.R. 209, [1961] 1 WLUK 18](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6C3F15C0E4B811DAB61499BEED25CD3B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Sturolson & Co v Weniz (1985) 17 H.L.R. 140, [1984] 6 WLUK 236](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA2058A90E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=821a3e5a9ab347d88585828bec6ac3ba&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
