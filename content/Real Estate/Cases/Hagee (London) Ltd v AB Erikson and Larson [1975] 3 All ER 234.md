# Hagee (London) Ltd v AB Erikson and Larson [1975] 3 All ER 234

A tenancy at will does not fall within the provisions of Part II of the [Landlord and Tenant Act 1954](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I609AB1B0E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d8391a6c2054da4a27c964c172dca64&contextData=(sc.Default)) whether it be created by operation of law or express agreement. The plaintiff lessees of business premises who were prohibited by the lease from sub-letting, in September 1971 by a written agreement let one floor of the premises to the defendants upon the express term that the defendants would occupy as tenants at will only with provision for refunding any proportionate part of the rent which was payable in advance upon termination of the tenancy. The defendants were told that they could be told to leave at any time. In September 1973 notice to quit was served upon the defendants who, when the plaintiffs sought possession, applied for a new tenancy, claiming the protection of the 1954 Act. Judge Lipfriend having made an order for possession, the defendants appealed.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the protection of the 1954 Act does not extend to tenancies at will.
