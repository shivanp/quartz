# Davis v Smith [2011] EWCA Civ 1603

> [!summary]
> The parties had always envisaged a split of the sale proceeds of the house and other assets and had conducted negotiations on that basis.

**FACTS:** In 1989, Mr and Mrs Smith bought a house as beneficial joint tenants. In 2009, they separated and Mr Smith left. Their solicitors advised each to serve a notice in writing on the other, although neither of them did. A divorce petition was issued, and solicitors exchanged correspondence regarding the joint assets: the house, two bank accounts and an endowment policy. It was agreed that the house should be sold and the endowment policy surrendered. The policy proceeds were shared as to £9,500 to Mr Smith and £3,000 to Mrs Smith on the basis that she would receive ‘the lion's share' of the proceeds of the sale of the house. She died before the house was sold.

**HELD:** Lord Neuberger MR acknowledged that agreeing to put the house on the market would not of itself be enough to sever the joint tenancy. They must have embarked on an exercise that went much further than that:

> ‘…the parties must have understood and assumed between themselves, irrespective of what they knew or did not know about the law, that they had negotiated and actually acted on the basis that their assets – and in particular the house, by far the biggest component of their assets – would be realised, and the proceeds divided equally between them.’

## Summary

It was clear from the conduct of the parties that they had agreed to sever a joint tenancy of a former matrimonial property and that it had been severed in equity.

## Abstract

The appellant (S) appealed against a decision that a joint tenancy of a former matrimonial property had been severed in equity.

S had been married to the mother (M) of the respondents (D) and they had jointly purchased a property that M had previously occupied as a council tenant. The marriage broke down and S moved out of the property and issued divorce proceedings against M. M and S's joint assets consisted of the property, some minimal cash and an endowment policy. It was agreed between M and S that the property should be sold and that the policy would be surrendered.

Correspondence between the parties' solicitors indicated that S would get all the proceeds from the policy and that M would get the "lion's share" of the sale of the property to make up for S receiving the policy proceeds. An offer was received for the sale of the house; however, the exchange of contracts was delayed. S's solicitors wrote to M mentioning the offer and the need to agree division of the proceeds of sale. A couple of days later M executed a will appointing D as executors of her estate. A few days later M died unexpectedly on a day that she had intended to visit her solicitors to serve a notice of severance of the joint tenancy pursuant to the Law of Property Act 1925 s.36(2). Both parties had been advised to serve a notice of severance, but neither had prior to M's death. The judge held that the joint tenancy had been severed by mutual agreement between M and S or by the course of dealing between them which led to the same result.

S contended that the judge had erred in finding that the joint tenancy had been severed.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1)The law pertaining to the severance of joint tenancies was largely to be found in _[Burgess v Rawnsley [1975] Ch. 429, [1975] 4 WLUK 19](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7D79C240E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4ec685a1fa8e40998a0e9fb02f5ebb40&contextData=(sc.Default))_. It was clear that a joint tenancy could survive a proposal and an agreement to put a property on the market and a subject to contract offer; even an eventual sale could be compliant with a joint tenancy continuing to exist, _[Marshall v Marshall [1998] 10 WLUK 35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I00BD5413165311E19D7A99084285F121/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4ec685a1fa8e40998a0e9fb02f5ebb40&contextData=(sc.Default))_applied. However, in the instant case, it was apparent from the correspondence between M and S that the parties had a common intention that the property be sold and that the proceeds be divided equally, albeit with balancing payments being made to M to reflect the fact that S had received the benefit of the sale of the policy. Cognizance had to be given to the fact that both M and S had been advised by solicitors, that both knew that the other was being advised by solicitors and that they both knew that having been married so long equal division of their assets was inevitable. Further, the only source for the balancing payment to M was from the sale of the property. Moreover, the parties had embarked upon the division of their assets on the basis that their assets would be divided equally. Accordingly, the judge had reached the right conclusion on the severance of the property, Burgess and Marshall applied. (2) Evidence pertaining to what parties wished to do, what they intended to do and what they were advised by their solicitors was irrelevant to the issue at hand. The court should concentrate on what passed between the parties by way of words and actions and what they knew. It should not normally consider what was communicated between a party and their solicitor (paras [22-23](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
