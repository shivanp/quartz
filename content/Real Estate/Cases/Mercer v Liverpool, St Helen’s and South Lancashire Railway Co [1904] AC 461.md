# Mercer v Liverpool, St Helenâ€™s and South Lancashire Railway Co [1904] AC 461

A railway company in virtue of its statutory powers served on a proprietor notice to treat for the purchase of a part of his lands and for compensation for damage by the execution of their works. Subsequent to the notice and the sending in of the particulars of his claim, the proprietor granted a building lease of a part of his lands adjoining the land proposed to be acquired by the railway company. The proprietor's claim was settled by the payment of a sum of money.

Held that the sum of money paid to the proprietor must be held to cover damage done to the lessee's holding in the execution of the works, and that the lessee could not claim compensation therefore from the railway company.
