# Anchor Brewhouse Developments v Berkley House (Docklands) Developments [1987] EGLR 172

D were owners of a development site. P owned neighbouring sites. D's contractors placed tower cranes upon D's land for the purposes of the works. The booms of these cranes oversailed P's land from time to time at such a height that in no way did they affect the normal use of that land. P issued proceedings claiming injunctions to restrain further trespass by oversailing.

Held, that the booms invaded P's air space; this constituted trespass (Kelsen v. Imperial Tobacco Co. [1957] C.L.Y. 3609 applied). There were no special circumstances sufficient to justify the withholding of an injunction.
