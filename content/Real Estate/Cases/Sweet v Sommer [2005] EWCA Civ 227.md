# Sweet v Sommer [2005] EWCA Civ 227

*Sweet v Sommer* concerned a domestic property. Due to historical conveyancing errors, the seller’s retained land had no vehicular right of way reserved, although it did have the benefit of a right of way on foot over the servient land.

The claim for a vehicular right of way succeeded, and the court did reserve a right of way implied by necessity. Reservations of implied easements by necessity are rare. The right of way was implied for vehicles, even though the dominant landowner did have access over the servient land on foot.

This case is important because it does appear to extend the scope of easements implied by necessity. The interpretation of ‘necessity’ is wider than previous cases. The court seems to be saying that land which is not accessible by vehicle is in effect incapable of being used. This represents a departure from the cases such as Manjang v Drammeh.

## Summary

Although a right of way had not been expressly granted by the owner of the servient tenement, the owner of the dominant tenement was entitled to enjoy the right of way as an overriding interest under the Land Registration Rules 1925 r.258. The restriction in the Land Registration Act 1925 s.82(3) on rectifying a register of the title to a property did not apply to rectification for the purpose of giving effect to an overriding interest.

## Abstract

The appellants (N) appealed against a decision that the respondents (S) had a vehicular right of way over a part of their land. The first appellant was the owner of a property known as the Old Forge and S were owners of an adjoining property known as the Forge Meadow. S also owned another adjoining property, namely the Northern Field. Vehicular access to the properties was gained from a public highway called Forge Road. The right of access over the yard forming part of the Old Forge had apparently been granted to S's predecessors in title by a transfer in 1988. However, the 1988 conveyance contained no express right of way across the retained land and S failed to register the right of way as a land charge. The main issues were:

(i) whether S were entitled to the vehicular access from Forge Road over Old Forge Yard to Forge Meadow as either a way of necessity or a right arising by way of proprietary estoppel;  
(ii) whether S were entitled to vehicular access from Forge Road over Old Forge Yard as appertaining to the Northern Field; and  
(iii) whether the judge had been entitled to make the orders for rectification of title that he did in consequence of his conclusions.

N submitted that

(1) it was not open to the judge to find that the "right enjoyed with" Forge Meadow passed over Old Forge Yard at the point where it joined Old Forge Road;  
(2) the access over the Old Forge Yard partly passed over a public footpath and therefore the use of it as a vehicular access was contrary to the [Road Traffic Act 1988 s.34](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I398A15A0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e1659177da624c77bedfda21c4f542fc&contextData=(sc.Default));  
(3) equity to which the judge found S to be entitled, requiring a declaration of a right of way, was overreached on the 1988 transfer;  
(4) even if S were entitled to the right they claim as appurtenant to the Northern Field, they could not exercise it for obtaining access to Forge Meadow;  
(5) the judge was wrong to rectify the register of the title to Old Forge and Old Forge Yard by placing a note in respect of the overriding interests.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) the vehicular access enjoyed by S's predecessor in title over part of Old Forge came within the [Land Registration Rules 1925 r.258](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF4342D20E57711DA894280D71E03719D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e1659177da624c77bedfda21c4f542fc&contextData=(sc.Default)) so as to constitute an overriding interest binding on N.

(2) It was not established that there was a public footpath over any part of Old Forge Yard. Further there was no evidence that the footpath, if existed over the Old Forge Yard, was subject to any public rights.

(3) The Law of Property Act 1925 s.2 could only overreach "any equitable interest or power" affecting the estate transferred. However equity arising from a proprietary estoppel was not an "equitable interest" capable of being overreached, *[ER Ives Investment Ltd v High [1967] 2 Q.B. 379, [1966] 11 WLUK 116](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA1D21C50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e1659177da624c77bedfda21c4f542fc&contextData=(sc.Default))* and *[Birmingham Midshires Mortgage Services Ltd v Sabherwal (Equitable Interest) (2000) 80 P. & C.R. 256, [1999] 12 WLUK 559](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I752EA6A0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e1659177da624c77bedfda21c4f542fc&contextData=(sc.Default))* applied. Further the [Land Registration Act 1925](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60CA4D30E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e1659177da624c77bedfda21c4f542fc&contextData=(sc.Default)) specifically provided that a registered disposition was effective to transfer the freehold estate in the land transferred subject to the overriding interests affecting it. In the instant case, N took the land subject to S's overriding interest. In the circumstances, S were entitled to the vehicular access from Forge Road over Old Forge Yard to Forge Meadow.

(4) The right of way was reputed to appertain to the Northern Field for the purposes of r.258 at the time of registration of the transfer in favour of N. It was not possible to preclude that right of way from being an overriding interest by an entry on the register of title to Old Forge and Old Forge Yard.

(5) The restriction on rectifying the register contained in s.82(3) of the [Land Registration Act 1925](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60CA4D30E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e1659177da624c77bedfda21c4f542fc&contextData=(sc.Default)) s.82(3) did not apply to rectification "for the purpose of giving effect to an overriding interest or an order of the court". Moreover s.70(3) of the Land Registration Act showed that there was no prohibition on noting an overriding interest on the register. The title to the Old Forge Yard on first registration contained such a notice and should be restored.
