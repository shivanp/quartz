# Walsh v Lonsdale (1882) 21 Ch D 9

#key-case

A land contract was given proprietary status in this case based on the equitable maxim that "equity regards as done that which ought to be done.‚Äù

In this case, the landlord and tenant entered into a contract for a 7 year lease. The tenant took possession of the property, but the parties failed to execute a deed to actually create the legal lease. The court recognised an equitable lease because of the existence of the contract and the availability of the remedy of specific performance.

This case therefore makes clear that a contract to create or transfer a legal property right will create a proprietary right in equity if the remedy of specific performance is available i.e. the claimant must have clean hands.
