# Paragon Finance v Nash [2002] WLR 685

## Summary

A variation in the rate of interest payable under a loan agreement could not be taken into account for the purpose of deciding whether the agreement amounted to an extortionate credit bargain.

## Abstract

N appealed against the striking out of a defence and counterclaim to a possession action brought by the mortgagee, PF, after N had fallen into mortgage interest arrears. N contended that the mortgage agreement, which contained a variable interest clause, became an extortionate credit bargain under the [Consumer Credit Act 1974 s.138](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I49841771E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c9400188c102419d82e905c9dd47aaee&contextData=(sc.Search)) following the failure by PF to bring its interest rates in line with the Bank of England or prevailing market rates. N sought to have the loan agreements reopened under s.139 of the 1974 Act, and to plead an implied term that PF was bound to exercise its discretion in varying interest rates fairly, honestly, in good faith, and not arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably, having regard to all relevant matters and ignoring the irrelevant.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that the discretion to vary interest rates was not completely unfettered and was subject to the implied term contended for by N, _[Lombard Tricity Finance v Paton [1989] 1 All E.R. 918, [1988] 10 WLUK 247](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70A3C980E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c9400188c102419d82e905c9dd47aaee&contextData=(sc.Search))_ not followed. However, the fact that PF had set interest rates without reference to those of other market lenders did not place PF in breach of the implied term. PF had been attempting to alleviate serious financial difficulties by passing its increasing costs onto its borrowers. Therefore it could not be said that its discretion to set interest rates was being exercised capriciously, arbitrarily, unreasonably or for an improper purpose. The argument that the rates of interest were exorbitant so as to bring the agreement within s.138 of the 1974 Act had no real prospect of success, given that only charges existing at the time of the agreement could be taken into account in determining whether a credit bargain was extortionate. Furthermore, it was not open to N to establish a breach of the [Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 s.3(2)(b)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA462E0E0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c9400188c102419d82e905c9dd47aaee&contextData=(sc.Search)) by arguing that PF had defeated their reasonable expectations, given that the setting of interest rates was not "contractual performance". The court could only intervene if a credit bargain had been grossly unfair to a borrower by requiring grossly exorbitant payments or if it had grossly contravened principles of fair dealing.
