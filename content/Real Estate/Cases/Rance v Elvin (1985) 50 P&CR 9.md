# Rance v Elvin (1985) 50 P&CR 9

A right to the uninterrupted passage and running of water through water pipes on land retained by a vendor in a conveyance does not impose a positive obligation to supply water to the property conveyed but a negative obligation not to interfere with existing water pipes and is as such an easement. P owned Chantry Farm House. Water was supplied to the Farm House through pipes on land belonging to D. The supply of water to D's land was metered by the water company. D paid the water company for water supplied to its land. That water included the water that flowed from D's land to the Farm House. The Farm House was conveyed to P by S in 1977. In 1978 the land owned by D was conveyed to it by S. The conveyance to P granted P the right to the free and uninterrupted passage and running of water through water pipes on the land retained by S. A dispute arose as to whether P was entitled to an easement to receive the water through the pipes under D's land. D contended that the easement claimed by P put an obligation on D to supply water to P, that, being a positive obligation on the owner of a servient tenement, was inconsistent with the existence of a easement. The trial judge upheld D's contention.

Held, allowing P's appeal, that two types of right were claimed by P, first a right to a supply of water and secondly a right to the uninterrupted passage of any water that came into the pipes under D's land. The first type of right imposed a positive obligation on D. The second type of right imposed a negative obligation on D not to interfere with the pipes carrying water to the Farm House. The second type of right was an easement, the benefit of which P was entitled to. D might interfere with the supply of water to the pipes carrying it to the Farm House but once it entered the pipes could not prevent it from getting there. The fact that D paid for the water was a matter connected with its initial supply and not its subsequent passage to the Farm House. There was an implied contract that P would pay D for the water consumed at the Farm House given that P knew D had to pay the water company for the supply of that water ( Schwann v. Cotton [1916] 2 Ch. 459 applied).
