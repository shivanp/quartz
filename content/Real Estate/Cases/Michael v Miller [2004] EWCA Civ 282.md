## Summary

In the case of a forced sale of mortgaged property, it was for the lender to decide how he should discharge his duty to obtain the best price reasonably available; in determining whether the lender had discharged that duty, the court was entitled to assess the sale price by reference to a bracket of acceptable valuations.

## Abstract

The instant appeal by the appellant mortgagors (RM) concerned the sale of an agricultural property by the respondents (DM) as mortgagees. An issue for determination was whether DM had breached their duty as mortgagees to take reasonable care to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable by the manner in which they had marketed the property. RM also submitted that the concept of a margin of error was entirely inappropriate in the context of a claim against a mortgagee for breach of duty to take reasonable steps to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable. RM contended that the mortgagee's duty was not to estimate the value of the property, but rather to ensure proper marketing and allow sufficient time for the property to be adequately exposed to the market.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that subject to any restrictions in the mortgage deed it was for a mortgagee to decide how a sale should be advertised and for how long a property should be left on the market. Such decisions inevitably involved an exercise of informed judgment. There was no absolute duty to advertise widely. A mortgagee would not breach his duty to a mortgagor if in the exercise of the power of sale he exercised his judgment reasonably and, to the extent that that judgment involved assessing market value, the mortgagee would have acted reasonably if his assessment fell within an acceptable margin of error. In so far as the exercise of a mortgagee's power of sale called for the exercise of informed judgment, the use of a margin of error had to be available to courts as a means of assessing whether a mortgagee had failed to exercise that judgment reasonably. In the instant case the judge had taken the unsatisfactory course of deciding first what was the market value and then asking himself whether DM were negligent in achieving a price substantially less. As the property had been exposed to the market and a number of genuine offers had been received, the more logical approach was to start by considering the steps which DM had taken to sell the property and then consider whether DM had acted reasonably in accepting the purchaser's offer.
