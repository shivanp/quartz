# Reeve v Lisle [1902] AC 461

The parties had entered into a series of agreements for loans, and partnerships. The defendants resisted a request by the plaintiff to be allowed, under the agreement, into partnership on a failure to repay the loan.  

Held: The appeal succeeded. The agreements were separate, and there could be no objection that one constituted a clog on the equity of redemption.  

Vaughan Williams explained:

> ‘I do not understand the defendant’s counsel to dispute that it is competent for a mortgagee to enter into an agreement to purchase from the mortgagor his equity of redemption. The only objection to such an agreement is, that it must not be part and parcel of the original loan or mortgage bargain. The mortgagee cannot, at the moment when he is lending his money and taking his security, enter into an agreement the effect of which would be that the mortgagor would have no equity of redemption. But there is nothing to prevent that being done which in substance and fact is subsequent to and independent of the original bargain.’
