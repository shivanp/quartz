# Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes [1974] 1 WLR 798

**FACTS**: there was a breach of covenant not to develop land without approval.

**HELD:** The court refused to grant a mandatory injunction to demolish the houses built in breach of covenant. It said that it would be ‘an unpardonable waste of much-needed houses’ to do so. Instead, it awarded equitable damages.

The court did not award damages to reflect to the loss in value to the dominant land (which was nominal). Instead, it awarded damages calculated as a percentage of the profit made by the developer. This reflected the amount which would theoretically have been paid to the owner of the dominant land to secure a release from the covenant.

This case is the basis for the term "Wrotham Park damages".

The validity of a restrictive covenant agreed at the time of sale of land and expressed to be for the benefit of the estate should be upheld, provided the estate owner may reasonably consider that the restriction remains of value to the estate.

In 1935 the owner of the estate sold part of the land to a developer subject to a covenant (the layout stipulation) not to develop the land without prior approval of a layout plan by the estate owner, the covenant being registered as a land charge. The development approved by the owner left a central area undeveloped. That area was bought by the local authority in 1955, planning consent for development was obtained and in 1971 the land was sold to P with the planning consent. Before construction commenced the owner's successors in title W reminded P of the covenant stating that any unapproved development would be in breach thereof. After preliminary work started W issued a writ seeking an injunction restraining the development, but P proceeded with the building and sold all the completed houses, remaining owners only of the access road. W did not seek any interlocutory relief.

At the trial of W's claim for a mandatory injunction against P and the house-owners for demolition of the buildings, held

(1) that the covenant was enforceable since it had been entered for the benefit of the covenantee's land which was sufficiently defined and was still capable of benefiting the estate;

(2) that although P clearly acted in breach of the covenant it would not be just to order demolition of the houses and access road, and damages would be granted in lieu of the mandatory injunctions sought;

(3) that the proper measure of damages was a sum which W might reasonably have required in return for relaxing the covenant, being five per cent of P's profits, the damages being payable by P and the house-owners in equal proportions.
