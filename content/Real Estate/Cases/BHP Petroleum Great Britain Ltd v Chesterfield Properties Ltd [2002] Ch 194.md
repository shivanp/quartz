# BHP Petroleum Great Britain Ltd v Chesterfield Properties Ltd [2002] Ch 194

## Summary

An obligation which was personal to the landlord was not a "landlord covenant" within the meaning of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 s.28, with the result that a notice served by the landlord in the instant case purporting to release it from an obligation making it liable for physical damage to the demised premises was ineffective to release it from liability for building defects.

## Abstract

C, the landlord, appealed against a decision ([2002] Ch. 12) that a notice served by it pursuant to the [Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 s.8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I64FE9980E44E11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b4e1a47de4e243b39e0e85d5771e946e&contextData=(sc.Default)) did not release it from liability for defects in works carried out to the demised premises. By the agreement for lease, B had undertaken to carry out specified works to the premises. C had transferred the reversionary interest and served the notice pursuant to s.8 applying to be released from "the landlord's obligations under the tenancy". B did not serve a counternotice and, after physical damage to the building became apparent, claimed that C was in breach of its covenant. C contended that service of the s.8 notice had operated to release it from such liability. B cross appealed against the judge's interpretation of the contractual extent of C's liability.

Held, dismissing the appeal and allowing the cross appeal, that the covenant was personal to C and was therefore not a "landlord covenant" for the purposes of the Act. The fact that the covenant "touched and concerned" the land did not preclude it from also being a personal covenant. Consequently service of the notice had not released C from its liability for the building defects. Further, the terms of the agreement provided that C was liable for making good defects which appeared prior to the expiry of the six year defect period but which did not cause physical damage until afterwards.
