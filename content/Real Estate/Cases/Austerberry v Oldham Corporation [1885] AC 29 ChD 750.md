# Austerberry v Oldham Corporation [1885] AC 29 ChD 750

The vendor conveyed a piece of land to the trustees for the purposes of making a road. The trustees covenanted that the land 'shall and will for ever hereafter be kept open and used as and for a road for the use of the public', and that they would make the road, and keep it in good repair, and allow the public to use it on payment of tolls. The vendor then sold his adjoining lands to the plaintiff, and the trustees sold the road to the defendants, both parties taking with notice of the covenant to repair.

The Court of Appeal held that the words 'shall and will for ever hereafter be kept open and used as and for a road for the use of the public' showed that although the vendor thought it would benefit himself and the other owners of the adjoining lands to have a road which they might use, that covenant was not entered into in such a way that it concerned the land reserved by the vendor. Accordingly, the plaintiff could not enforce the covenant to repair against the defendants.

In that case, X entered into a positive covenant to repair a road over Yâ€™s land. As it was a positive covenant the rules in equity could not be used. X had the burden of the covenant, and the servient land; and Y had the benefit of the covenant and the dominant land. X sold the servient land to Oldham Corporation, and Y sold the dominant land to Austerberry. Oldham Corporation refused to pay for the maintenance and repair of the road. It was held that Austerberry, who had the benefit of the covenant at common law rules could not sue Oldham Corporation as the burden of a covenant does not pass at common law. This decision was followed for over 100 years and was confirmed by the House of Lords in Rhone v Stephens in 1994.
