# Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809

**FACTS:** Mr Street granted to Miss Mountford a right to occupy rooms. The parties entered into a written agreement which described the arrangement throughout as a ‘licence’ and called the agreed payment a ‘licence fee’.

**HELD:** The House of Lords held that this was in substance a tenancy, a lease, rather than a licence.

In determining whether an agreement creates a lease or a licence, a court in future would look at the substance, not the label. The parties cannot alter the effect of an arrangement simply by calling it a licence and as Lord Templeman famously said 'a five-pronged instrument for digging earth is a fork, even though the parties might call it a spade'.

## Abstract

An agreement granting exclusive occupation of residential accommodation for a term at a rent (where no services are provided) creates a tenancy, notwithstanding the use of the word "licence". By an agreement S granted M the right to occupy two rooms at a weekly rent subject to 14 days notice of termination. The agreement was entitled "licence agreement," and contained a declaration signed by M, to the effect that the agreement did not create a tenancy. Later S sought an order declaring whether the occupancy was a license or a protected tenancy. The recorder declared it to be a tenancy; the Court of Appeal declared it to be a licence.

Held, allowing the appeal, that where residential accommodation was granted for a term with exclusive possession, no attendance or services being provided, the legal consequence was the granting of a tenancy (notwithstanding the use of the word "licence") (_[Murray Bull & Co Ltd v Murray [1953] 1 Q.B. 211, [1952] 11 WLUK 70](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I09C34D70E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9ca54fa4e71449a09233f4fce2a18c02&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled; _[Sturolson & Co v Weniz (1985) 17 H.L.R. 140, [1984] 6 WLUK 236](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA2058A90E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9ca54fa4e71449a09233f4fce2a18c02&contextData=(sc.Default))_ disapproved).
