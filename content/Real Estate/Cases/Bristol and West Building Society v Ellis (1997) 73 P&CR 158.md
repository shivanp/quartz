# Bristol and West Building Society v Ellis (1997) 73 P&CR 158

B appealed against a decision upholding the suspended execution of a warrant for the possession of a property occupied by the second defendant, E, whose husband had moved out leaving substantial arrears. E had failed to comply with an initial order that she pay GBP 5000 immediately and GBP 200 per month thereafter, in addition to interest, but the possession order was suspended on terms that she paid GBP 5000 and discharged the mortgage debt by selling the property within three to five years, after her children had finished their education. B submitted that the suspension order was contrary to the [Administration of Justice Act 1970](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60641150E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=36241dce52b643cc97e6d6df4681ad70&contextData=(sc.Search)) s.36 which provided that the period for repayment should be reasonable.

Held, allowing the appeal, that as E could not discharge the arrears by periodic payment it was important to consider whether the period before sale was reasonable as, if it was not determined, B could be left with the order until the expiry of the mortgage and with arrears still unpaid. However, a reasonable period was not strictly definable and depended on the facts of the case, having regard to the delay in selling the property which had already occurred and the adequacy of the security if the debt was close to the value of the property. In the circumstances there was insufficient evidence for the judge to exercise his discretion and find that the property could be sold at a high enough price to discharge E's debt within a three to five year period and the appropriate order was an order for immediate possession, _[National & Provincial Building Society v Lloyd [1996] 1 All E.R. 630, [1995] 12 WLUK 86](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7A4FD4B0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=36241dce52b643cc97e6d6df4681ad70&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed.
