# Powell v Hemsley [1909] 2 Ch 252

The purchaser of part of a freehold building estate covenanted with the vendor for himself and his assigns to erect no other than private residences and to submit plans for approval before commencing to build. The lessees breached the covenant. The lessees became bankrupt, and their trustees having disclaimed the lease, the purchaser took possession of the land and the offending building. The vendor sold the rest of the estate to the plaintiff with the benefit of the purchaser's covenants. The plaintiff brought an action against the purchaser to compel the removal of the building, and for damages. The Court of Appeal held that there was no continuing breach. The covenant was broken when the building was erected contrary to it. The breach was committed not by the purchaser, but by his lessees, and he did not, by his conduct, render himself liable for the violation of the covenant. Thus, the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief neither at law nor in equity.
