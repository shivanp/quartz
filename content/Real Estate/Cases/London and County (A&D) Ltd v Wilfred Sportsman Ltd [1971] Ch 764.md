# London and County (A&D) Ltd v Wilfred Sportsman Ltd [1971] Ch 764

An assignee of the reversion of a lease may forfeit for non-payment of rent even though the right of re-entry arose before the assignment.

On August 1, 1961, L leased two adjoining properties, Nos. 5 and 6, to H for 21 years from September 29, 1960. The lease of No.5 contained a proviso for re-entry if the rents were at any time unpaid for 21 days. In September, 1961, H assigned the two leases to TP who sub-let No.6 to D. In June, 1963, L granted a licence to TP to assign the lease of No.5 to M, TP guaranteeing L against M's defaults. In August, 1963, TP assigned the leases to M, that of No.6 being subject to D's sub-lease and M mortgaged that of No.5 to P. In March 1964, M defaulted in payment of the rents of both Nos. 5 and 6, L called upon TP to pay and D paid rent to TP with M's consent. TP paid the rent to L until they obtained the grant of a lease direct from L, the last such payment being on June 24, 1965, in respect of rent due on that date. In March 1965, P obtained an order for possession of No.5 because M had defaulted on payments under the mortgage. M gave up occupation in May 1965 and D moved into No.5 (as well as No.6) at TP's instance. On August 2, 1965, L sent new head leases of Nos. 5 and 6 to TP being for 21 years and 7 days from September 29, 1960, and "subject to and with the benefit of" the lease of August 1, 1961. In September, 1965, P wrote asking D to give vacant possession. D, having been advised that TP were legally landlords, displayed a notice in November, 1965, saying the premises had been re-entered for non-payment of rent. On appeal to the Court of Appeal on the question whether TP had ever been able as reversioner to M's lease of No.5 to forfeit it, and, if so, whether TP had re-entered so as to effect forfeiture, held, allowing the appeal,

(1) even if the receipt by L of payments by TP under the licence was a waiver of the right to forfeit, the occasion of forfeiture for non-payment of rent due on June 24, 1965, only arose on July 15 and so could not have been so waived;

(2) nothing in the lease dated August 2, 1965, was a waiver because it had neither been communicated to nor could have any effect on the tenant; and

(3) the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.141](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I396EEC80E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=668a02f75bb84747a60e8e056cdaeee8&contextData=(sc.Default)) indicated that an assignee of the reversion could re-enter for rent in arrears even when the right arose before the assignment; so TP could and did in fact forfeit M's lease and had re-entered to effect the forfeiture. ( _[Rickett v Green [1910] 1 K.B. 253, [1909] 12 WLUK 36](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I880FE9E1E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=668a02f75bb84747a60e8e056cdaeee8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ approved; _[Flight v Bentley 58 E.R. 793, [1835] 6 WLUK 38](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7707090E57011DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=668a02f75bb84747a60e8e056cdaeee8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ disapproved; _[Davenport v Smith [1921] 2 Ch. 270, [1921] 7 WLUK 33](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I94C559F0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=668a02f75bb84747a60e8e056cdaeee8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled.)

There is no reason of principle why a right of forfeiture arising from a failure to pay rent, cannot be waived in exactly the same way as a right of forfeiture arising from a breach of any other covenant in the Lease.  

Russell LJ said:

> ‘The other argument put forward was that there can never be waiver of forfeiture for non-payment of rent by recognition of the continued existence of the Lease because, as has often been said, a right of re-entry for non-payment of rent is a mere security for the payment. I am not aware of any authority for this proposition, and I see no justification in principle for making this distinction between a default in an obligation to pay rent and any other obligation. Of course, rent may be demanded after the forfeiture days are passed, and, indeed, part payment accepted on account without waiving the forfeiture; this does not recognise the continued existence of the Lease beyond the date when that rent was payable. I refer in this connection also to the passage in Shepherd v Berger [1892] 1 QB 597, 599, which appears to me inconsistent with the proposition advanced.’
