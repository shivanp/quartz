# Fairclough v Swan Brewery Co Ltd [1912] AC 565

FACTS: Fairclough mortgaged the lease of his pub to Swan Brewery. At the time of the mortgage, the lease had 17.5 years left to run. A clause in the mortgage deed postponed the legal date for redemption (and therefore the equitable right to redeem too) until six weeks before the lease expired. The borrower wished to redeem early.

HELD: the clause postponing redemption was struck out, and the borrower was permitted to redeem earlier. The clause was a fetter on the equity of redemption because it prevented the borrower from getting back anything of any value. A lease with only six weeks left to run would be virtually worthless, making the mortgage in reality irredeemable.

A key point to note from this case includes the fact it was a leasehold estate that was mortgaged, therefore a depreciating asset. This meant the borrower could not get back exactly what he had mortgaged on redemption.

The applicant, in consideration of a mortgage of the licensed premises, which the respondent granted to him, borrowed Â£3500, to be repaid by 208 monthly instalments. The applicant was not to be at liberty to pay off the debt otherwise than by instalments without the respondent's express written consent, and the premises, which were to be a tied house during the continuance of the security, were held for a term of years. On the respondent's failure to supply beer, the applicant assumed to treat the tie as at an end. The respondent brought an action for damages and an injunction. The applicant counter-claimed to redeem. The judge ruled in the respondent's favour. The applicant appealed to the full court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The Privy Council, allowing in part the appeal, held that the mortgage was obviously meant to be irredeemable. The provision as to the repayment of the debt could not be enforced. Thus, the applicant was entitled to redeem.
