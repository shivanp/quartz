# Warnborough v Garmite [2003] EWCA Civ 1544

## Summary

Options to repurchase property granted by purchaser to vendor - Purchase price left outstanding secured by charge over property - Trial required to decide whether options void as "clogs on the equity of redemption".

## Abstract

W, the original owner of the leasehold interest in certain land, appealed against a decision ([2003] EWHC 282) that options to repurchase that land granted by G, the purchaser of the land, constituted clogs on the equity of redemption. In 1996 W assigned its interest in the land to G. Three transactions were entered into: firstly, the land was assigned to G in return for a premium of GBP 130,000; secondly, W granted G a loan of that sum which was secured on the land by way of a legal charge; thirdly, G gave W an option to repurchase the land in the event of its defaulting on the loan. In 1999, after G had fallen into arrears with the loan payments, the parties entered into additional transactions pursuant to which G executed a supplemental legal charge securing the payment to W of GBP 15,000 and granted W a further option to purchase the land. W contended that the judge below erred in characterising the agreements as being a transaction of mortgage and that a trial was required to discover the true nature of the transaction.

Held, allowing the appeal, that it was open to the court to decide by reference to the parties' intention gathered from all the circumstances that the transaction was not in substance one of mortgage, _[Samuel v Jarrah Timber & Wood Paving Corp Ltd [1904] A.C. 323, [1904] 5 WLUK 39](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I97999320E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=15fcf485afea4558a8abeb4d161d55c6&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[G&C Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat & Cold Storage Co Ltd [1914] A.C. 25, [1913] 11 WLUK 73](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAC559BC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=15fcf485afea4558a8abeb4d161d55c6&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. The mere fact that, contemporaneously with the grant of a mortgage over property, the mortgagor granted the mortgagee an option to purchase only raised the question whether the rule against clogs applied and did not answer it. In order to answer that question the court had to look at the substance of the transaction to discover the true nature of the bargain between the parties. Where an option to purchase was granted against the background of a sale of the property by the grantee of the option, as owner of the property, to the grantor for a price that was to be left outstanding on mortgage, there was a very strong likelihood that the court would conclude that the substance of the transaction was one of sale and purchase and not one of mortgage. However, the question of whether the options were clogs could only be resolved at trial.
