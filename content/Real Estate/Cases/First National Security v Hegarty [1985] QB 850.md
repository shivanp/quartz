# First National Security v Hegarty [1985] QB 850

**FACTS:** A couple owned a house as beneficial joint tenants. They separated and the husband left. He mortgaged the house by forging his wife’s signature on the mortgage deed, and took the loan money.

**HELD:** a sole act by one joint tenant will have no effect at law. Therefore the legal mortgage was ineffective. However, the purported legal charge was held to be a charge on the husband’s equitable interest, which severed the joint tenancy. That mortgage could be enforced by the lender but the wife’s share was unaffected.

Where plaintiffs seeking a charging order have been diligent in pursuing a debtor husband before his wife has petitioned for divorce, and the judge has exercised his discretion in favour of making the order, the Court of Appeal will not interfere. Per Stephenson L.J.: the court should not use its powers under the [Matrimonial Causes Act 1973](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60580360E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=61a2b024ce6d4dd1b11a439e463d0c71&contextData=(sc.Default)) so as to defeat legitimate creditors of a husband, but may, and often should, defer enforcement of a charging order until after disposing of any application underthe [Law of Property Act 1925 s.30](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38CF9F40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=61a2b024ce6d4dd1b11a439e463d0c71&contextData=(sc.Default)). In 1978 H and W bought a house as joint tenants. In 1979 H, pretending that he was acting on behalf of himself and W, obtained a loan from FNS and charged the house as security, forging W's signature on both application and charge. In 1980 FNS obtained judgment in default against H, who had left the country, and subsequently obtained ex parte a charging order nisi over H's interest in the house. Shortly thereafter W petitioned for divorce and the Master refused to make absolute the charging order. The judge allowed the appeal and refused at the same time to permit a transfer, on W's application, to the Family Division.

Held, dismissing W's appeal, that the judge had considered all the relevant matters when he had allowed the appeal. FNS had been prompt in pursuing their remedies against H's share in the house and had done so before W began her divorce proceedings. There were no grounds for varying the order made by the judge (_[Roberts Petroleum Ltd v Bernard Kenny Ltd (In Liquidation) [1983] 2 A.C. 192, [1983] 2 WLUK 103](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I88DB5031E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=61a2b024ce6d4dd1b11a439e463d0c71&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Harman v Glencross [1985] Fam. 49, [1984] 2 WLUK 164](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBA2A9020E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=61a2b024ce6d4dd1b11a439e463d0c71&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
