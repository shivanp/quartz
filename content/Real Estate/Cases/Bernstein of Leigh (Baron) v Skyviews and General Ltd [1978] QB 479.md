# Bernstein of Leigh (Baron) v Skyviews and General Ltd [1978] QB 479

## Abstract

An owner of land has rights in the air space above his land only to such a height as is necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of his land and the structures upon it. Per curiam. The protection given by the [Civil Aviation Act 1949 s.40(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3F16A0908F5011E3A094CF791C0A6936/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b8cbfa7b44564b5aa5d87789e0fb553f&contextData=(sc.Default)) extends to all flights which are at a reasonable height and comply with the statutory requirements. S Ltd took an aerial photograph of B's country house and offered to sell it to him. B claimed damages for trespass and/or invasion of privacy for entering the air space above his property and taking the photograph without permission.

Held, giving judgment for S Ltd, that there had been no infringement of B's rights in the air space above his property.
