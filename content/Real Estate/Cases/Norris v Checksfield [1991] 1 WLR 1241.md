# Norris v Checksfield [1991] 1 WLR 1241

FACTS: A lorry driver claimed a lease of the premises he was occupying as part of his job.

HELD: The court held there was no lease and it was a service occupancy because he required the premises for the better performance of his job. It meant he could do late night / emergency on short notice deliveries.

Where an employee was granted a licence to occupy property during his employment for the better performance of his duties, his licence came to an end if he was summarily dismissed for misconduct, and no notice to quit was required. In 1989, N took on C as a semi-skilled mechanic, and it was a condition of his employment that he would drive coaches and apply for a PSV licence. He was allowed to occupy a bungalow near his work "for the better performance of his duties." Before moving into the property he signed a document confirming the terms of the occupation which referred to him having a "licence" to occupy the bungalow, and that on termination of his employment the licence would cease forthwith. Every week, GBP 5 was deducted from his wages for the occupation. In December 1989, he was summarily dismissed since N found out that he was a disqualified driver. Without serving a notice to quit, N brought an action for possession. The judge granted the order and C appealed.

Held, dismissing C's appeal, that (1) an employee's right to exclusive possession of an employer's house, together with payment of rent, did not necessarily create a tenancy if the employee was genuinely required to occupy it "for the better performance of his duties". An employer could grant a licence even where the employee went into occupation before taking up the employment where there was a sufficient nexus between the start of the occupation and the employment. As he had gone into occupation to perform the driving duties expected of him, he was a service licensee and not a tenant ( _[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2a465d9bd3e148bba8f4663e1b523838&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[AG Securities v Vaughan [1990] 1 A.C. 417, [1988] 11 WLUK 117](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5398EF01E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2a465d9bd3e148bba8f4663e1b523838&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished); (2) the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 s.5(1A) , which requires a valid notice to quit to be served in order to determine the right to occupy a dwelling-house, only applies to a "periodic licence". The licence in this case was not periodic, being granted for the single period of employment, and was terminable on the end of the employment without notice ( _[Ivory v Palmer [1975] I.C.R. 340, [1975] 3 WLUK 18](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICB1C2DD0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2a465d9bd3e148bba8f4663e1b523838&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).
