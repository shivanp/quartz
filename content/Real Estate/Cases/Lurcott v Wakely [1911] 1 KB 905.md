# Lurcott v Wakely [1911] 1 KB 905

FACTS: The front external wall of a 200 year-old house had to be taken down to ground floor level and rebuilt. The defects were attributable to old age.

HELD: The tenant was held liable under his repairing covenant. ‘Repair is restoration by renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts. Renewal, as distinguished from repair, is reconstruction of the entirety.’
