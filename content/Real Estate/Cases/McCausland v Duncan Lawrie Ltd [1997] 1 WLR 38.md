# McCausland v Duncan Lawrie Ltd [1997] 1 WLR 38

**FACTS:** The parties tried to orally agree a variation to the agreed completion date in the sale contract.

**HELD:** This variation was held to be void. Whenever a material term in a land contract is varied that variation must also comply with LP(MP)A 1989 s.2.

M and another appealed against the striking out of their claim for specific performance of a contract for the sale of a property which set a date for completion of March 26, 1995 and provided that failure to complete on that date would make payable the balance of a GBP 20,000 deposit. The respondents' solicitor realised that the completion date was a Sunday and, by arrangement with M's solicitors, rescheduled completion for March 24. However, M failed to pay the balance of the purchase price on demand for completion and paid the deposit with the intention of seeking recovery if the respondents were not entitled to serve a completion notice on the earlier date. M argued that the variation of the contract was invalid as it failed to comply with the [Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA99A6900E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=efbe540add204ec2979441a63c69f1f6&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, allowing the appeal, that the requirements laid down in s.2, that all the terms of the contract for the sale of land had to be incorporated into a signed document, also extended to the subsequent variation of a contract, with the effect that both the variation of the completion date and the respondents' rescission of the contract of sale were invalid.
