# Link Lending v Bustard [2010] EWCA Civ 424

**FACTS:**

Mrs Bustard (‘B’) suffered a mental illness which impaired her ability to make rational decisions. She was the registered freehold owner of her home. Mrs Hussein (‘H’) fraudulently persuaded B to transfer the property to her in 2004. H borrowed money from Link Lending (‘L’) and secured the loan with a mortgage over the property. B never received any money for the transfer or from the loan, although she remained living at the property. In 2007 B was detained in a mental health hospital and was unable to live at home. She paid the bills and visited every week. When H defaulted on the loan, L brought possession proceedings.

**HELD:**

The court considered whether B had an overriding interest under **LRA 2002, Sched 3 para 2**? It was plain that although she had transferred the legal estate to H, she retained the equitable interest. The question was whether B was in actual occupation. L argued that forcible detention in hospital for over a year meant that she was not, and therefore had no overriding interest to bind it.

The court held that as a matter of fact, B was in actual occupation. Her belongings remained; her absence was involuntary; and her regular visits demonstrated a continuing intention to return.

M and another appealed against the striking out of their claim for specific performance of a contract for the sale of a property which set a date for completion of March 26, 1995 and provided that failure to complete on that date would make payable the balance of a GBP 20,000 deposit. The respondents' solicitor realised that the completion date was a Sunday and, by arrangement with M's solicitors, rescheduled completion for March 24. However, M failed to pay the balance of the purchase price on demand for completion and paid the deposit with the intention of seeking recovery if the respondents were not entitled to serve a completion notice on the earlier date. M argued that the variation of the contract was invalid as it failed to comply with the [Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA99A6900E44B11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3622dc448b324f538eb757cd50f50b5b&contextData=(sc.Default)).

Held, allowing the appeal, that the requirements laid down in s.2, that all the terms of the contract for the sale of land had to be incorporated into a signed document, also extended to the subsequent variation of a contract, with the effect that both the variation of the completion date and the respondents' rescission of the contract of sale were invalid.
