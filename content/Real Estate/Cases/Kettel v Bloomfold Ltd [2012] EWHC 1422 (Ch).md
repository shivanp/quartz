# Kettel v Bloomfold Ltd [2012] EWHC 1422 (Ch)

## Summary

A lease, properly construed, granted the leaseholders an express easement of the right to use designated parking spaces and, in the circumstances, they were entitled to an injunction preventing the landlord from building on those parking spaces.

## Abstract

The applicant leaseholders (X) applied for an injunction restraining the respondent landlord (B) from building on their car parking spaces.

X, who lived in flats, had the benefit of using designated parking spaces under the terms of their leases. The leases stated that B demised to them "the Premises TOGETHER with the rights specified in the Second Schedule". The rights referred to in the second schedule included the sole right to use the parking spaces for the purpose of parking a taxed car or motorbike. X sought an injunction preventing B from building a block of flats on the site covering their parking spaces.

B submitted that it had the right to require X to use other parking spaces in place of those originally allocated to them; alternatively, that the offer of alternative parking spaces, which were equally convenient, meant that any remedy should be limited to nominal damages rather than an injunction. X submitted that their right to use the parking spaces amounted to a demise, and was not merely an easement.

## Held

Application granted.

(1) It was necessary to examine whether the terms of the rights, properly construed and together with any terms which might properly be implied, were so extensive as to deprive B of any reasonable use of the land, _[Batchelor v Marlow [2001] EWCA Civ 1051, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 764, [2001] 6 WLUK 646](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70396CC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a200c60388284016be235cee1d5e3ef1&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed. The lease, properly construed, did not demise to X the parking spaces. Further, X's submission that the grant of sole use at a rent was equivalent to exclusive occupation did not bear scrutiny: X were not granted sole use of the parking spaces, but were granted the sole right to use the car parking spaces for parking a car or motorbike; B was only prevented from doing that which would be inconsistent with the ability to park in the parking spaces; and there was an express right for others to pass across the parking spaces. There were also a number of factors which were strong indicators that there had not been a demise of the parking spaces, including the fact that under the terms of the lease X were only to hold "the Premises" and not the other rights described in the lease; all of X's covenants, including the restriction on assignment, were expressed to apply to the premises, and not the parking spaces; and the proviso for re-entry and the covenant of quiet enjoyment applied only to the premises, as did the express right of entry to carry out works. Therefore, if B had intended to demise the parking spaces, it had obliged itself to maintain it but had excluded itself from access to it. Therefore, the rights granted could not be construed as a demise (see paras [13, 16-20](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) An easement had not been excluded since B's rights over the parking spaces did not leave it with no reasonable use of the land so as to make ownership of it illusory, _[Virdi v Chana [2008] EWHC 2901 (Ch), [2008] N.P.C. 130, [2008] 11 WLUK 718](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7DEAE6F0C27D11DD848392623F7BD591/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a200c60388284016be235cee1d5e3ef1&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered. Therefore, X's right to use the parking spaces amounted to an easement (para.[22](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The lease, properly construed, did not reserve a right for B to build on the parking spaces. In addition, B had no implied right to change the designated parking spaces. In general, a servient landowner had no right unilaterally to extinguish an easement over one area of land on provision of an equivalent easement over another, _[Greenwich Healthcare NHS Trust v London and Quadrant Housing Trust [1998] 1 W.L.R. 1749, [1998] 5 WLUK 415](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB4C46C00E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a200c60388284016be235cee1d5e3ef1&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Heslop v Bishton [2009] EWHC 607 (Ch), [2009] 2 E.G.L.R. 11, [2009] 4 WLUK 312](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9C8BBA00308511DEAC8BA4B10641B81D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a200c60388284016be235cee1d5e3ef1&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied, Owners of Strata Plan 42472 v Menala Pty Ltd (1998) 9 BPR 97 considered (paras [26, 33, 35](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) B's actions amounted to an entire abrogation of the express easements. It was not a trivial injury, and caused more than merely small financial loss. The interference with X's rights was being undertaken for B's private profit, and not for any wider public benefit. Further, the grant of an injunction would not be oppressive to B. It was for X, whose rights had been infringed, to decide whether they were prepared to accept the provision of different parking spaces, and they were not acting unreasonably in seeking to enforce their rights. Therefore, it was appropriate to grant an injunction (paras [52-53, 59](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(5) If the conclusion on remedy was wrong, then the appropriate basis for determining the quantum of damages was the "release fee" basis, which was the sum that would be negotiated between willing parties for the right to do what could not be done without X's consent. Such damages would have been compensatory, _[Stadium Capital Holdings (No.2) Ltd v St Marylebone Property Co Plc [2011] EWHC 2856 (Ch), [2012] 1 P. & C.R. 7, [2011] 11 WLUK 184](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE6FD68F20A8911E1ACDE9BB444DBF220/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a200c60388284016be235cee1d5e3ef1&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied. It would have been appropriate for the value generated from the development to have been split equally, after making a 25 per cent allowance for developer's profit (paras [60-62, 72](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
