# Stanhope v Haworth (1886) 3 TLR 34

The landlord leased a house to the tenant. The tenant failed to pay the rent, and the lease was forfeited. The landlord leased the house to another and spent money fixing the house. The original tenant returned with the money, and applied for relief against forfeiture. The English Court held that relief against forfeiture for non-payment of rent would be refused where the granting of the relief would injure third parties who had been allowed into possession of the leased premises. In the instant case, the house had already been lawfully let to the new tenant after the forfeiture. Accordingly, there was delay in making the application, and the relief was refused.
