# City of London Building Society v Flegg

City of London Building Society v Flegg in 1988 concerned Mr and Mrs Flegg, and their daughter and son-in-law, the Maxwell-Browns. All four had decided to buy a property together and all made direct contributions to purchase price. The Fleggs paid cash and the Maxwell-Browns borrowed their contribution. Legal title was held by the Maxwell-Browns but the Fleggs had beneficial interests under an implied trust which arose from their contribution to the price. Without the Fleggs’ knowledge the Maxwell-Browns remortgaged the property several times to help Mr Maxwell-Brown’s business. The business failed, the Maxwell-Browns failed to make the mortgage repayments and the Building Society sought possession. The Fleggs said they had beneficial interests in the property which bound the building society and therefore it could not enforce mortgage. The House of Lords had to decide whether this was right.

The court held that it was not right. The Fleggs did originally have interests in the land because of their contribution to the price. However when the Maxwell-Browns borrowed money from the building society, the building society had paid the money to two trustees/legal owners, being the Maxwell-Browns. The effect of this was that the Fleggs’ interests in land were transferred to the money. Of course, this had now gone. Although the Fleggs were living in the property, as they did not have a beneficial interest in the land, the building society was not bound in any way, and the Fleggs had to move out. Any claim the Fleggs had was against the Maxwell Browns who had received the money. This was of course a very hard decision for the Fleggs to live with, although it was great for the building society which was free to repossess. If the Maxwell-Browns had been honest trustees, they would have handed over to the Fleggs the amount of money which represented their interest.
