# Virdi v Chana (2008)

## Summary

Where a dominant landowner had successfully registered an exclusive right to park as an easement, denial of that right to an individual who in part owned the servient land, where the part within her ownership was not sufficient to park on, did not amount to a denial of her reasonable use of the servient land, as she would have to commit a trespass in order to park.

## Abstract

The appellant landowner (V) appealed against a decision of an adjudicator entitling the respondent landowners (C) to register an easement to park over land in part owned by her.

C had a right of way across a piece of unregistered land which adjoined V's property. C claimed that they had acquired by prescription the right to park one car on part of the land. By an order of the adjudicator a plan was drawn up delineating in yellow the area over which C claimed a prescriptive right. The yellow land was in part owned by V and was in part within the unregistered land. The adjudicator determined that C had proved the requisite user to justify registration of the right to park as an easement, and that such an easement was capable of existing in law. However, the adjudicator did not limit the prescriptive right to the yellow land but extended it to a slightly larger gravelled area, as that larger area comprised the parking area in dispute. The adjudicator further held that there was room to park only a single car on the gravelled area and that C alone was entitled to exercise the right of parking.

V submitted that (1) the adjudicator should have limited her consideration of the issues to the yellow land as indicated on the plan; (2) an easement could not exist giving the dominant owner an exclusive right to park in a single parking space.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) Although the plan delineated the yellow land only, V had not been prejudiced by the adjudicator considering the gravelled area. Had C sought permission to amend the plan to mark on the gravelled area, the adjudicator could not have refused permission. Therefore, the adjudicator was right to consider the ouster issue in relation to the gravelled area as well as the yellow land. Moreover, even though the yellow land was marked on the plan the evidence had not discriminated between it and the gravelled area. In any event, if the gravelled area had been delineated on the plan the evidence presented would not have been any different and as the adjudicator considered both plots of land it would have been artificial and unjust to limit consideration to the yellow land only.

(2) It could not be said that depriving V of the ability to park on the gravelled area amounted to denying her a reasonable use of the servient land. The part of the land that was within V's ownership was not sufficient to park a car on and in order to do so she would have to trespass on the adjoining unregistered owner's land to park on the gravelled area. A user that could only be sensibly effected by trespassing on adjoining land did not amount to a reasonable use of the servient land, and depriving V of that right did not render her ownership of the servient land illusory. The adjudicator had been wrong to accept that the test of user in _[Batchelor v Marlow [2001] EWCA Civ 1051, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 764, [2001] 6 WLUK 646](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I70396CC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e7a614d092de47328c1a8308f624411a&contextData=(sc.Search))_ had been modified to one of possession and control by _[Moncrieff v Jamieson [2007] UKHL 42, [2007] 1 W.L.R. 2620, [2007] 10 WLUK 410](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1BC69F607D3611DCBB77A1568C1C893B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e7a614d092de47328c1a8308f624411a&contextData=(sc.Search))_, Moncrieff considered. While Moncrieff criticised the strict test of user in Batchelor it had not overruled it, and therefore Batchelor remained binding. However, the present case was distinguishable on the facts as the parking space was adjacent to V's property and she had the ability to alter the surface for aesthetic reasons. The adjudicator had correctly noted that V was still able to maintain the part of the land that she owned and deal with it as the owner in that she had the ability to alter the surface of the land, maintain her fence, and plantage providing they did not interfere with the parking. None of those users of land could be dismissed as insignificant or illusory, Batchelor distinguished. In addition the adjudicator had had the benefit of hearing the witnesses and the advantage of a site view. Accordingly, the adjudicator had been right to conclude that easement was capable of existing in law and that the ouster principle did not apply.
