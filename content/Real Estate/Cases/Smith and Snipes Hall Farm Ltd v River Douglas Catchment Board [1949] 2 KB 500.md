# Smith and Snipes Hall Farm Ltd v River Douglas Catchment Board [1949] 2 KB 500

The following principles apply in cases where the question arises whether the benefit of a covenant does or does not run with the land:

1. It is first necessary to ascertain from the deed that the covenant is one which "touches or concerns" the land, that is, it must either affect the land as regards mode of occupation or must be such as per se, and not merely from collateral circumstances, affects the value of the land, and it must then be shown that it was the intention of the parties that the benefit thereof should run with the land.
2. A covenant, if it runs with the land, is binding on the covenantor though a mere stranger.
3. The deed containing the covenant need not expressly identify the particular land to be benefited, but the maxim id certum est quod certum reddi potest will apply so as to make admissible extrinsic evidence to prove the extent and situation of the lands of the respective landowners.
4. Once it is found that a covenant runs with the land and that such land is capable of identification, it can be enforced by virtue of the provisions of s.78(1) of the Law of Property Act, 1925, at the suit of the covenantee and his successors in title and the persons deriving title under him. In return for lump sum payments the defendant board, with the object of improving the drainage of land liable to flooding and of preventing future flooding, covenanted by deed with landowners, including predecessors in title of the plaintiffs, to do certain works to the banks of the E. Brook, one of such banks being, in fact, situate upon and forming part of the plaintiff's lands, and to maintain for all time the works when completed. The defendant board carried out the works defectively, with the result that the plaintiff's lands were later flooded. Held, the deed affected the value of the land per se and converted it from flooded meadows to land suitable for agriculture, and showed an intention that the benefit of the obligation to maintain should attach thereto into whosesoever hands the lands should come. Consequently, the plaintiffs could sue in respect of the damage resulting to their respective interests therein by reason of the defendant board's breach of covenant. _[Rogers v Hosegood [1900] 2 Ch. 388, [1900] 7 WLUK 14](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I89A8D960E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=976ba1dde46e4c698ecef2e1fe336334&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
