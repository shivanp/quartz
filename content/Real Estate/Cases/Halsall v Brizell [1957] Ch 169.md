# Halsall v Brizell [1957] Ch 169

**FACTS**: a transfer deed relating to a plot of land granted rights of way and drainage over private roads and drains. In the deed, the original purchasers covenanted to contribute to the cost of maintaining the roads and drains.

A successor covenantor relied on the common law rule that a burden does not pass, and refused to pay, whilst still enjoying the benefit of the easements.

**HELD**: the court accepted that the burden had not passed, but said that unless successor covenantors submitted to the burden voluntarily, they could not take the benefit.

Therefore, if the successor covenantor is happy to relinquish the benefit, the burden cannot be enforced. The liability is conditional.

A covenant by plot owners under a building scheme to pay a due and just proportion in respect of amenities for the benefit of the owners of the plots contemplates that there will be an assessment upon each plot, but an assessment in respect of the user to which the plot may be put will be ultra vires. Under a building scheme entered into in 1851 by a large number of owners of properties a piece of land was sold off in some 174 plots. After the plots had been sold off there remained vested in two of the original purchasers, whose successors the plaintiffs were, the roads and a promenade along a sea wall. On the sale of the plots in 1851 the respective purchasers entered into a number of building covenants and these covenants were repeated in a deed of August 19, 1851. The object of the deed was to declare trusts concerning the roads and the promenade for the benefit of the purchasers and to provide (inter alia) for payment of the necessary expenses proportionately by the owners in respect of the upkeep and maintenance of the roads and promenade, and also of the sewers, which had been placed under the road. Cl. 7 of the deed provided: "That each and every of them the said persons parties to these presents and his respective heirs executors administrators and assigns shall and will from time to time contribute and pay a due and just proportion in respect of the plot or several plots of land in the said plan marked with his name respectively and of the dwelling-house on each such plot erected or to be erected â€¦" in respect of (inter alia) the expenses to be incurred in maintaining and keeping in good repair the roads, sea wall, promenade and sewers. The trustees were empowered to distrain on failure to pay calls. Provision was made for the calling of an annual general meeting of the owners of plots, at which expenses to be incurred in carrying out maintenance and repair work were to be agreed. In 1928, the Lancaster Chancery Court declared that the restrictive covenants did not prevent the owner for the time being of any house erected under the building scheme from dividing it into two or more flats. Pursuant to that declaration the defendants' house was divided and let to five separate tenants. In 1950 a resolution was passed by a general meeting of plot owners according to which three calls of GBP 3 each were to be made upon the defendants as their plot had been divided into five flats. (The resolution provided that no more than three calls were to be made in respect of any one plot.) The defendants had been willing to pay GBP 3 in respect of the one plot but denied the validity of the resolution purporting to make them liable to pay three calls in respect of one plot.

Held,

(1) although the covenant in respect of which the application to the court had been made was a positive covenant in respect of which the defendants could not have been sued, the defendants could not take the benefits under the deed without subscribing to the obligations thereunder; therefore, they were bound by the deed, if they desired to take its benefits;

(2) the provision for distraining on failure to pay the calls was invalid since a right to distrain could only be annexed to a rentcharge, which was not the case here;

(3) the whole of this document was concerned with the management of the roads and other amenities for the benefit of the owners of the plots as such and when the document referred to a contributor paying a due and just proportion in respect of a plot or several plots and the dwelling-house thereon, the parties contemplated that there would be an assessment upon each plot; that might be an assessment according to the value of the plot, but it could not really be an assessment in respect of the user to which the plot might be put; accordingly, the resolution was ultra vires and void, for the deed did not empower the meeting of plot owners to exercise their discretion in that way.
