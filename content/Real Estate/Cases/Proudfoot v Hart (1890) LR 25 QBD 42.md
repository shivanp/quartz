# Proudfoot v Hart (1890) LR 25 QBD 42

The Court of Appeal, Civil Division, held that a tenant, who had agreed that he would keep and leave a house in ‘good tenantable repair’, was obliged to keep and leave it in such repair as, taking into account the age, character, and locality of the house, would make it reasonably fit for the occupation of a reasonably minded tenant of the class that would be likely to want such a house. A tenant who agreed to ‘keep’ premises in good tenantable repair was not excused from doing so by reason that the premises were not in good tenantable repair at the time of the demise. In that case, he had to put the premises in good tenantable repair.
