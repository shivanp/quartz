# Church v Brown (1908) 15 Ves Jr 258, 33 ER 752

The Lord Chancellor’s Court held that if the landlord had a covenant against both assigning and underletting, the tenant might by an agreement, neither assign nor underlet the premises to another person in possession of it. However, parting with the possession in that manner would not be a breach of those covenants. A further covenant not to part with the possession of the premises would not have restrained the tenant from parting with a part of the premises, as those covenants were always construed by courts of law with the utmost jealousy to prevent the restraint from going beyond the express stipulation. The court would have to consider whether all the covenants were also included under the terms ‘usual and proper covenants’ in the construction of an equitable agreement.
