# Royal Philanthropic v Country (1985) 276 EG 1068

FACTS: A teacher, who was occupying a house near the school where he taught, claimed he had a lease.

HELD: The court held he had a lease (i.e., there was no service occupancy) because the occupation did not enable him to better perform his duties as a teacher, and it was simply a perk of the job.

D was employed by the local authority on P's behalf as a house parent at a school, and was granted a service licence of a furnished flat within the school building for the better performance of his duties. When D subsequently married in November 1981 and raised "the possibility of a school house," he was allowed to occupy such a house. No formal written agreement was entered into, but in correspondence and subsequent notices to quit there were regular references by the authority to a "tenancy," and also a reference to "a yearly rental of GBP 256." When D's employment at the school terminated, P sought possession on the grounds that D occupied the house on the same basis as that on which he had previously occupied the flat, namely as a licensee only. The recorder found for P and made an order for possession.

Held, allowing D's appeal, that (1) when residential accommodation is granted for a term at a rent with exclusive possession, the landlord providing neither attendance nor services, the grant is a tenancy save in exceptional circumstances (_[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=34ad7870923849088af5ef0de8d8c1f4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied); (2) neither the relationship of the parties, nor D's previous occupation of the flat (it not being suggested that his occupation of the house was a service occupancy), nor the low rent, nor the extreme informality of the paperwork, nor other features relied on by P were sufficient to render this an "exceptional case".
