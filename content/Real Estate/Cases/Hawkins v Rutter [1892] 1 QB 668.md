# Hawkins v Rutter [1892] 1 QB 668

In an action tried in the county court, the claimant claimed as an easement the right, as one of the public, to ground his barge on the bed of a navigable river. The Queen's Bench Division held that s 60 of the County Courts Act 1888 applied only to easements in respect of which there existed a dominant and servient tenement, so that no right to an 'easement', within the meaning of that section, came in question in the action.
