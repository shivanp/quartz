# Williams & Glyn’s bank v Boland [1981] AC 487

Here the house was in Mr Boland’s sole name: he held the legal title. His wife had made a substantial contribution to the price, so she had an equitable interest under an implied trust with her husband as sole trustee. Without Mrs Boland’s knowledge or consent, Mr Boland remortgaged the property to the Bank, which raised no enquiries about her. The bank paid the mortgage money to Mr Boland – i.e. to one trustee.

When the bank sought possession, to sell property and recover money due, Mrs Boland argued that it couldn’t enforce the mortgage against her because she had a beneficial interest in the land which had not been overreached and which bound the bank as she was in actual occupation. The court agreed that the bank had not overreached her interest because they had paid the money to just one trustee – Mr Boland. It should have insisted that a second legal trustee was appointed (ideally, Mrs Boland) to overreach any potential beneficial interest she had. As there was no overreaching, Mrs Boland’s interest remained in the land itself, rather than transferring to the money, and bound the bank which was unable to repossess and sell.

A beneficiary like Mrs Boland could have taken steps to make sure that she was are protected as far as possible by registering a restriction on the Properietorship register instructing a purchaser to pay money to at least two trustees. But how many beneficiaries do you think actually register a restriction?

How many people actually do this so that at least they get an interest in the sale proceeds? Not many. They simply don’t realise that they have to. Yet the beneficiaries can still be protected if their interests are not overreached and they are in actual occupation of the land – in that case they may have overriding interests under **LRA Sched 3 para 2**. This is what made Mrs Boland’s interest binding on the bank: it was a beneficial interest under a trust, which had not been overreached; and she was in actual occupation.

The equitable interest of a spouse in actual occupation of a matrimonial home legally owned by the other spouse has an overriding interest, taking priority over a legal charge created by the legal owner. In two cases, wives had an equitable interest in their matrimonial homes of which the husbands were legal owners, the wives' interests deriving from their financial contributions towards purchase or repayment of mortgage; such interests were unregistered. After the wives had acquired such an interest, each husband mortgaged the house by way of legal mortgage to the appellant bank, who made no enquiry as to the wives' status or occupation of either house. Upon the husband's defaulting, the bank foreclosed and obtained possession orders for the houses, such orders being then reversed on appeal.

Held, dismissing the bank's appeal, that in each case the wife was a person "in actual occupation" within the meaning of the [Land Registration Act 1925 s.70(1)(g)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39ECF620E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=92dda5b0434f42709ec77d38841474a9&contextData=(sc.Default)) and the bank's charge was subject to the wife's overriding interest.
