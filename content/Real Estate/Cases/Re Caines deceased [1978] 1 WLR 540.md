# Re Caines deceased [1978] 1 WLR 540

On an application under Ord.18, r.19 (1) (a), to strike out an originating summons, the prohibition under r. 19 (2) does not apply to an affidavit which had already been put in as supporting the originating summons. Per curiam: The operation of Ord.18, r. 19, in the case of originating summonses is something that the Rules Committee might with advantage consider. K issued an originating summons, with supporting affidavit, against S and H, the executors of a will, claiming as a beneficiary under the will an order for the administration of the estate of the testator and ancillary relief. The executors issued a summons under [RSC Ord.18 r.19(1)(a)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I94C5EA30E4AB11DA9407CBB86AE37856/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9877e1747a424feebc1f2933285231f0&contextData=(sc.Default)), seeking an order that the proceedings be dismissed on the grounds that K had no locus standi to bring them, and that they disclosed no cause of action. The argument before the Master was on the footing that the affidavit in support was before the court. When the executors' summons was adjourned to the judge, K objected to the admissibility of his own affidavit. He contended that it fell within the prohibition in Ord.18, r. 19 (2), and so had to be excluded from consideration.

Held, dismissing the executors' summons, that

(1) Ord.18, r.19(3), could be read as requiring a degree of flexibility to avoid leaving most originating summonses outside the practical operation of r.19 and that, since the supporting affidavit had already been used before the Master without objection, the unity of proceedings in the Chancery Division prevented it from being excluded at the hearing before the judge;

(2) it was impossible to say that K had no locus standi and had no cause of action.
