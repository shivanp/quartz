# Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Fumegrange Ltd and others [1994] 2 EGLR 90

The question for the court to consider was whether exclusive possession of two service stations was granted to Fumegrange.

The court held that the degree of control exercised by Esso over the premises and the way in which it was conducted was inconsistent with an exclusive right to possession of the service stations being vested in Fumegrange. Esso could make alterations on the premises; it could install a car wash (as was in fact done); and it could change the layout of the shop.

This degree of physical control over the premises and conduct of the business at the service station was held to be very significant.

## Abstract

Esso claimed possession of two service stations in respect of which there were three agreements between the parties: a partnership licence agreement; an Esso shop franchise agreement; and an ESSO car wash agreement. The occupiers claimed they were tenants, not licencees.

Held, that they were licencees as, on the true construction of the agreements, the occupiers did not have a right to exclusive possession of the premises ( _[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6106d42d968b48c59a0715ad1aee781c&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[AG Securities v Vaughan [1990] 1 A.C. 417, [1988] 11 WLUK 117](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5398EF01E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6106d42d968b48c59a0715ad1aee781c&contextData=(sc.Search))_ considered).
