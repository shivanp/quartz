# Burgess v Rawnsley [1975] Ch 429

```ad-summary
The court said that in order for the joint tenancy to be severed by mutual agreement, an express or inferred agreement to change the basis on which co-ownership will continue is required. Co-ownership does not end on severance of the joint tenancy: it continues on a different basis. An agreement to do this can be expressly stated, or (as in this case) inferred from what the parties said and did.
```

**FACTS**: Mr Honick and Mrs Rawnsley bought a house as beneficial joint tenants, each paying half of the purchase price. In 1968, after their relationship broke down, Mrs Rawnsley orally agreed to sell her share to Mr Honick for £750, but subsequently changed her mind and wanted £1000. Mr Honick died before anything was resolved. Mr Honick’s daughter argued that the beneficial joint tenancy had been severed, and as he had died as a tenant in common, she took his share on his death. The court looked at whether and when there had been severance by mutual agreement.

**HELD**: the equitable joint tenancy was severed by mutual oral agreement when the parties had informally agreed a price of £750. This did not amount to a specifically enforceable contract for sale of the interest, but it was enough to show that the parties agreed to sever the joint tenancy. It did not matter that the agreement was never acted upon, nor that Mr Honick never actually bought Mrs Burgess’ interest.

**SIR JOHN PENNYCUICK**:

> It is not in dispute that an agreement for severance between joint tenants effects a severance. This is the rule 2 propounded by Sir William Page Wood V.-C. in Williams v. Hensman […]. The words he uses are contained in one sentence: "Secondly, a joint tenancy may be severed by mutual agreement."… The case falls squarely within rule 2 of Page Wood V.-C. […] Rule 2 applies equally, I think, whether the agreement between the two joint tenants is expressly to sever or is to deal with the property in a manner which involves severance. Mr. Levy [acting for Mrs Rawnsley] contended that in order that rule 2 should apply, the agreement must be specifically enforceable. I do not see any sufficient reason for importing this qualification. The significance of an agreement is not that it binds the parties; but that it serves as an indication of a common intention to sever, something which it was indisputably within their power to do. It will be observed that Page Wood V.-C. in his rule 2 makes no mention of specific enforceability.

An oral agreement by one joint tenant of a house to sell his interest to the other joint tenant, which is not specifically enforceable and is subsequently repudiated, will nevertheless operate to sever the joint tenancy. M, a widower, and F, a widow, bought a house in their joint names, each providing half of the purchase price, as joint tenants. M, who already occupied part of the house, bought it as a matrimonial home, intending to marry F. F intended to occupy the other part of the house herself, had no intention of marrying and did not know of M's intentions. They did not marry, and F never moved in. M and F agreed orally that F would sell M her share. F subsequently refused to carry out the agreement. M died, and F claimed that the house was hers by survivorship.

Held, that since there was no common purpose which had failed, there was no resulting trust; however, the agreement to sell had operated to sever the joint tenancy, the house was not F's by survivorship, and she held it on trust for herself and for M's estate in equal shares.
