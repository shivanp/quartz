# Harris v Goddard [1983] 1 WLR 1203

This case also involved a divorce petition issued by the wife. The petition included a request for such order ‘as may be just’ relating to the matrimonial home. The husband died as a result of a car accident before the divorce hearing.

The children from the husband’s first marriage argued that he died as a tenant in common as his wife had severed the joint tenancy. The court disagreed. Unlike the papers in Re Draper’s Conveyance, the divorce petition request did not show a sufficient desire to sever immediately as it may have been ‘just’ to order a sale in the future and not immediately.

LAWTON LJ:

> ‘When a notice in writing of a desire to sever is served pursuant to section 36(2) it takes effect forthwith. It follows that a desire to sever must evince an intention to bring about the wanted result immediately. A notice in writing which expresses a desire to bring about the wanted result at some time in the future is not, in my judgment, a notice in writing within section 36(2).’

A prayer in a divorce petition for an order in relation to the matrimonial home and property does not operate of itself so as to sever the spouses' joint tenancy. H and W were equitable joint tenants of the matrimonial home and shop premises. W petitioned for divorce. The petition included a prayer for such order in relation to the property by way of transfer or settlement as should be just. H was killed in a car accident before the hearing of the petition. H's executors claimed that the joint tenancy had been severed by the prayer in the petition, and that his estate was entitled to half the property. The judge rejected that claim.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that although a notice in writing of a desire to sever a joint tenancy took effect forthwith, the desire to sever must itself be immediate. The prayer in the petition was merely an invitation to the court to decide at some future time whether or not to exercise its jurisdiction in any one of a number of ways in relation to the property. Accordingly, W was beneficially entitled to the whole of the property (_[Draper's Conveyance, Re [1969] 1 Ch. 486, [1967] 10 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9B2C9A60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ce3b6da1441d49559f03532c3f7faae8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished; _[Bedson v Bedson [1965] 2 Q.B. 666, [1965] 7 WLUK 83](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I72ED1B10E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ce3b6da1441d49559f03532c3f7faae8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered; _[Wilks, Re [1891] 3 Ch. 59, [1891] 5 WLUK 48](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I00B75D60E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ce3b6da1441d49559f03532c3f7faae8&contextData=(sc.Default))_ not followed).
