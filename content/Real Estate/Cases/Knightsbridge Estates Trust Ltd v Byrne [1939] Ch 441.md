# Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne [1939] Ch 441

FACTS: This was another commercial case, but here the borrower mortgaged the freehold of a hotel. The legal date for redemption was postponed for 40 years from the date of the loan. The borrower wanted to redeem early.

HELD: the court upheld the postponement of redemption and would not allow early repayment on the basis that the right to redeem had not been rendered illusory. The borrower would (eventually) get back exactly what had been mortgaged, and the borrower had been given a favourable low rate of interest as part of the mortgage deal.

Key points to note from this case are the estate being mortgaged was freehold (and was commercial premises). A freehold estate is enduring and rarely loses value. The borrower would get back exactly what they mortgaged on redemption. Further, the deal also favoured the borrower â€“ it got something in return.

The borrower mortgaged its properties to the lender to secure a loan. The borrower covenanted to repay the money borrowed with interest by 80 half-yearly instalments. It also agreed to demise the mortgaged land to the lender for a long term of years with the usual proviso for cesser. After a few years, the borrower wanted to redeem the property by repaying the principal borrowed sum. It sought a declaration for entitlement to redeem at any time by giving the usual notice. It contended that the stipulation that the mortgage should not be redeemed until after 40 years was void as being a clog on the equity of redemption. The House of Lords held that the mortgage was a debenture; under s 74 of the Companies Act 1929, and therefore was not rendered invalid by reason of being redeemable only after 40 years. The rule against perpetuities did not apply to mortgages. Thus, the appellant was not entitled to the declaration claimed.
