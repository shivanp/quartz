# Coatsworth v Johnson [1886-90] All EER Rep 547

A landlord and tenant entered into a contract for a lease of a farm. The tenant moved in, but the lease was not completed by deed.

The court would not recognise an equitable lease because the tenant has breached a term of the contract and so the remedy of specific performance was not available as the tenant was not coming to court ‘with clean hands’.
