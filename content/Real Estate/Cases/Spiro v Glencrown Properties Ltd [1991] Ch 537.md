# Spiro v Glencrown Properties Ltd [1991] Ch 537

## Abstract

A vendor (S), sought damages against a purchaser (G) and G's guarantor for breach of contract for the purchase of land. S granted G an option to purchase. The agreement of which the option formed part was signed by both parties. Despite giving written notice to exercise this option complying with S's conditions, G did not complete. G's letter exercising the option was signed on behalf of G alone. The issue was whether the agreement granting the option was a contract for sale of land complying with the formalities required by s.2 of the 1989 Act which provided in subs.(3) that "the documents must be signed by or on behalf of each party. ". G argued that the option was an "irrevocable offer" which did not become a contract for the sale of land until he had given notice of his acceptance.

Held: The grant of the option was the "contract for the sale or other disposition of an interest in land" for s.2 purposes. Section 2 was designed to prevent such disputes. Only the grant of the option needed consent. To exercise the option was a unilateral act which did not require a counter-signature by a vendor.
