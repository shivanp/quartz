# Wheeler v JJ Saunders Ltd [1995] 3 WLR 466

the claimant bought a farmhouse, and the defendant bought an adjoining field from the same seller. There were two means of access to the farmhouse, one of which was across the defendant’s land. The access had been used as a quasi-easement when the farmhouse and the field were in the seller’s ownership. The defendant blocked the access, and the claimant claimed an easement implied under the rule in Wheeldon v Burrows. The court held that although the other Wheeldon tests were met, the easement was not necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the farmhouse as the other access was equally convenient.

P bought a farmhouse and outbuildings on land adjacent to D's pig farm. Both P's property and the farmland were formerly in common ownership. There were two means of access to P's property, one of which ("the south entrance") could only be reached by crossing a part of D's land but there was no express right of way and D took the view that P were not entitled to use it and blocked it off with a wall. D also applied for and, despite P's objections, obtained planning permission to build two pig housing units on their land, one of which was only a few metres away from one of P's outbuildings which was used as a holiday cottage. In proceedings, P obtained damages against D for obstructing a right of way to their property with the new wall and for nuisance in the form of smell from the pigs in the housing units, and injunctions requiring D to demolish the wall and restraining them from keeping pigs in the housing units. On D's appeal P contended for an implied grant in their conveyance of an easement of necessity entitling them to a right of way over D's land. D argued that no such right was intended and, as regards the nuisance, contended that since they had obtained planning permission for the pig housing units, any smell emanating therefrom could not amount to a nuisance in law.

Held, allowing the appeal in part, that

(1) the class of easements implied in favour of a grantee included easements necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the property granted and which had been and were at the time of the grant used by the owners of the entirety for the benefit of the part granted but that, on the facts, the south entrance to P's property was not necessary for its reasonable enjoyment since the other entrance would do just as well and it followed that P acquired no right of way through the south entrance, _[Wheeldon v Burrows (1879) 12 Ch.

(2) unlike Parliament, a planning authority had no jurisdiction to authorise a nuisance save insofar as it had a statutory power to permit a change in the character of a neighbourhood and the nuisance was such that it inevitably resulted from the authorised use, and

(3) in the present case, the planning permission granted was not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest but amounted only to a change of use of a small piece of land for the benefit of P and to the detriment of the objectors in the quiet enjoyment of their house and as such it followed that the judge was entitled to conclude that the planning consents did not prevent P from succeeding in their claim in nuisance, _[Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd [1981] A.C. 1001, [1981] 1 WLUK 723](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5CEAA530E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c6c76f0272954c4ba3752e6402d10157&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
