# Stafford v Lee (1993) 65 P. & C.R. 172

The court found a common intention based on the surrounding land shown as building plots on the transfer plan.

## Summary

In determining whether an intended easement should be implied, the requirement that the parties should have intended a definite and particular use of the land conveyed did not require that the intention be proved as a certainty. It was enough that it was proved on the balance of probabilities.

## Abstract

The defendants (L) appealed against a decision of a county court judge declaring that the plaintiffs (S) were entitled to a right of way along a section of roadway owned by L.

S owned an area of woodland, and had been granted planning permission to build a dwelling on it. The only practicable means of access to the land was over and along L's roadway. S's land had been transferred to the original owner in 1955 by a deed of gift. The deed described the land conveyed as having a frontage to the roadway, but contained no express grant of a right of way over it. S claimed entitlement to an "intended easement", as described in _[Pwllbach Colliery Co Ltd v Woodman [1915] A.C. 634, [1915] 2 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2E08E2D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=23109ff532244d27a357dcd83adbf3b5&contextData=(sc.Search))_. L admitted in their defence that the 1955 deed passed to the donee a right to use the roadway, and that that right had passed to S. However, their case was that the right was limited to use for all purposes necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the land as woodland, which was the manner of its enjoyment in 1955. The judge held that S could establish an entitlement to the easement based on the Pwllbach Colliery principle.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) Intended easements, like all other implied easements, were subject to the general rule that they were implied more readily in favour of a grantee than a grantor. Nevertheless, the parties had to intend that the subject of the grant should be used in some definite and particular manner. If the grantee could establish the requisite intention, the law would then imply the grant of such easements as might be necessary to give effect to it, Pwllbach Colliery applied. It was axiomatic that in construing any conveyance, the facts in reference to which it was made had to be taken into account. In the instant case, no extrinsic evidence had been adduced, so the court could only refer to the 1955 deed. The material question in the instant case was not how the land was enjoyed in 1955, but whether the parties to the deed had intended that it should be used in some definite and particular manner. The requirement that the parties should have intended a definite and particular use of the land did not require that the intention be proved as a certainty. It was enough that it was proved on the balance of probabilities.

(2) The plan annexed to the deed could be relied upon for the purpose of establishing the parties' intention as to the use to which the land should be put. It was part of the material agreed on by the parties: there was no reason why their common intention, if it was not expressed, should not be implied from that as much as from any other part of the agreed material. The plan delineated, as the land conveyed, a plot adjoining two other similar-sized plots on which dwellings had already been constructed. On the balance of probabilities, the parties could only have intended that the land should be used for the construction of another dwelling to be used thereafter for residential purposes. No other intention could reasonably be imputed to them. The easements claimed by S and declared in their favour by the judge were necessary, and were no more than was necessary, to give effect to the intention so established.
