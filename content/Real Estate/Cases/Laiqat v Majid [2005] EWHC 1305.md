# Laiqat v Majid [2005] EWHC 1305

## Summary

An overhanging that occurred four metres above ground level would be regarded as an interference with airspace and would amount to trespass. Accordingly, there was a trespass to land where an extractor fan protruded into a neighbour's garden by 750 mm and its base was 4.5 metres above ground level.

## Abstract

The appellant (L) appealed against a decision that an extractor fan, installed by the respondents (M) on their property, did not trespass into her garden. The fan projected into L's garden by 750 mm and its base was 4.5 metres above ground level. The judge dismissed her trespass claim on the basis that the fan was at such a height that it did not interfere with any normal activity within L's garden. L argued that the judge erred in concluding that the test for determining trespass was whether "it would interfere with any normal activity in the garden". She contended that the fan was a permanent intrusion into her airspace as it was permanently suspended only a few metres above ground level.

Held, allowing the appeal, that it was clear from the authorities that an interference with airspace above another person's land constituted trespass except where the interference was at such a great height that it did not interfere with the claimant's airspace, _[Anchor Brewhouse Developments Ltd v Berkley House (Docklands Developments) Ltd 38 B.L.R. 82, [1987] 1 WLUK 780](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I32C63B70E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f3a866af2d664a50b8d4f4795615e10f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. In light of the authorities, it was clear that an overhanging that occurred four metres above ground level would be regarded as an interference with airspace and would amount to trespass. The authorities did not support the judge's approach to the question of trespass. In sum, the positioning of the fan constituted a trespass by M into L's garden.
