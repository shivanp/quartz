# Manjang v Drammeh (1991) 61 P. & C.R. 194

Facts: Land sold adjoined a river. There was no right of way granted to buyer over retained land of seller.

Held: Claim for right of way implied by necessity failed, as there was alternative access by river. If there is an alternative access route, even if it is inconvenient or difficult, no easement will be implied by necessity, as in the case of Manjang v Drammeh as it was still possible to access the dominant land by river. The implied easement was not essential to be able to use the dominant land.
