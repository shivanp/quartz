# Moule v Garrett (1872) LR 7 Exch 101

The plaintiff was a lessee of a premises under a lease, containing a covenant to keep in repair. He assigned the lease to a third person, who assigned it to the defendants. The assignment contained express covenants with the immediate assignors respectively, to indemnify them against all subsequent breaches. While the defendants were in possession, they committed breaches of the covenant to keep in repair, in respect of which the lessor recovered damages from the plaintiff. The plaintiff then filed an action to recover those damages against the defendants. The Exchequer Chamber held that an assignee of a lease by mesne assignments was under an obligation to indemnify the original lessee against breaches of covenant in the lease committed during the continuance of his own tenancy. That obligation was not affected by the covenants, which the assignee might have made with his immediate assignor. Thus, in the instant case, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.
