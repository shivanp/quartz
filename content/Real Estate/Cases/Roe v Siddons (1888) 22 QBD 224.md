# Roe v Siddons (1888) 22 QBD 224

The owner of two adjoining pieces of land granted one to the first grantee and the other to the second grantee. The grant to the first grantee contained the general words 'together with all ways, etc, and easements, and appurtenances whatsoever to the tenement, and premises hereby granted, or any part thereof, now or heretofore held or enjoyed, or reputed or known as part or parcel thereof, or appurtenant thereto'. The previous occupiers of the two tenements used, in common, a formed private road leading to the high road, which the first grantee claimed as part of the land conveyed to him. The Court of Appeal held that the inference that the word 'heretofore' in the grant to the first grantee was used in its ordinary grammatical meaning was rebutted. Thus, the right to the use of the private road did not pass to the first grantee. Further, the owner of the two tenements could have no easement over one of them in respect of the other.
