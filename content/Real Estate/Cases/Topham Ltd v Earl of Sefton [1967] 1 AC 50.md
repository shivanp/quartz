# Topham Ltd v Earl of Sefton [1967] 1 AC 50

The landowner let the premises to the tenant for a racecourse operation. The landowner sold the land to the tenant with a covenant 'not to cause or permit the land to be used other than for horse-racing' and certain other permitted purposes. The tenant later agreed to sell the land to a company to be used as a housing estate. The landowner successfully sued to restrain the tenant from breaching their covenant and to restrain the tenant and the company from carrying the sale contract into effect. The tenant passed a resolution to close down its business and appealed against the granting of the injunction orders. The House of Lords held that the sale of the land with knowledge that the purchaser intended to use it for a purpose other than horse-racing was not of itself to 'permit' such use, for one did not permit what one could not control. Thus, the tenant would not commit a breach of covenant by completing the contract for sale.
