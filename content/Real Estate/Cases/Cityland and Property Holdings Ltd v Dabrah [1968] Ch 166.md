# Cityland and Property Holdings Ltd v Dabrah [1968] Ch 166

#key-case

Facts: The borrower was a tenant of the lender for 11 years. The lender had refused to renew the lease and had threatened the tenant with eviction. The tenant had limited means, so the lender offered to lend him the money to buy the property.

The mortgage deed did not clearly state the interest rate, but it was approximately 19%. The arrangement included payment of a premium of 57% of the original sum lent if the borrower defaulted on payments. When this was factored into the calculation, the overall interest rate was 38%.

Held: The interest rate was an unconscionable term and was reduced to 7%. Goff J emphasised the clear imbalance of bargaining power between the parties. The borrower was in a vulnerable position, being threatened with homelessness, which the lender had exploited. He said that the lender was entitled to charge a higher rate of interest than the market rate, but the imposition of the premium was unconscionable, as it wiped out any chance of surplus sale proceeds for the borrower.

## Abstract

A premium on a mortgage loan is a collateral advantage. In certain circumstances it may be unreasonable and then the court will grant relief against it. A purchased certain land from B for GBP 3,500, paying GBP 600 from his own resources and leaving the remainder, GBP 2,900, outstanding on a mortgage of the land to B. The mortgage deed provided (a) that, in return for the loan of GBP 2,900, A charged the land with payment of GBP 4,553 to B payable over six years, and (b) that in the event of default the whole charged sum was to become payable. There was no provision as to interest but the charged sum contained an element of GBP 1,653 as a premium. This premium represented 57 per cent of the loan or 19 per cent per annum interest. A claimed relief against the premium on the ground that it was an unreasonable collateral advantage.

Held,  
(1) that the premium was a collateral advantage;  
(2) that in the circumstances the premium, particularly with regard to its comparative size and the fact that it was to be payable in full on default, was unreasonable; and  
(3) that the mortgage would be varied to secure payment of the loan together with interest at 7 per cent (_[G&C Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat & Cold Storage Co Ltd [1914] A.C. 25, [1913] 11 WLUK 73](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAC559BC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c4ec21dbb54b498eb406725ece5e2138&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed).
