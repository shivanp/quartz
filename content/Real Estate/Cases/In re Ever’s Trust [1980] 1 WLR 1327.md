# In re Everâ€™s Trust [1980] 1 WLR 1327

The court's discretion to order sale of a property under the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.30](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38CF9F40E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5d96a58563444c27b7fc50c25bee6c1c&contextData=(sc.Default)) is not the same as their discretion to adjust property rights under the [Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 s.24](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2B154250E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5d96a58563444c27b7fc50c25bee6c1c&contextData=(sc.Default)) . A man and his common law wife bought, and held, a property on trust for sale as joint-tenants. They had one child and two of D's children lived with them. On parting, P and D failed to agree on a sale. P applied to the court for an order for sale, as a person interested under s.30 of the 1925 Act. On P's appeal against an order for sale, which was postponed until the parties' child reached 16 years; the practice in cases under s.24 of the 1973 Act.

Held, that in exercising its discretion to execute a trust for sale, under s.30 of the 1925 Act, the court had no power to adjust property rights, as it has under s.24 of the 1973 Act. However, in considering, as the court must under s.30, the underlying purpose of the trust; i.e. a home for the family; as against the primary purpose of sale, the interests of the children are relevant. On the facts, the court dismissed P's application, but gave liberty to reapply if circumstances changed. P's appeal was dismissed to that extent.
