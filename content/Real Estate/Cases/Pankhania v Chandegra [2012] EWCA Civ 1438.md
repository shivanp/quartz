# Pankhania v Chandegra [2012] EWCA Civ 1438

## Summary

A judge had erred in imposing a constructive trust of the beneficial interests in a property to one owner where the transfer deed contained an express declaration of trust to both tenants in common in equal shares.

## Abstract

The appellant (P) appealed against a decision that the legal and beneficial ownership of a property resided solely with the respondent (C), his aunt.

The property had been transferred into the names of P and C as tenants in common in equal shares with an express declaration of trust to that effect. The judge below had found that C had insufficient income to obtain a mortgage. P had therefore agreed to become a joint mortgagor so that his salary would be taken into account. The judge determined that P had never sought to live in the property, nor to derive any income from it, and had only recently paid some Â£2,500 towards the mortgage. The judge decided that the transfer had been a sham, that the property had been bought for C, and held that the beneficial interest was C's entirely.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

If the property had been transferred to joint tenants with no indication of their respective beneficial interests, then the judge's approach would have been correct. However, P and C had made an express declaration of trust of the beneficial interest and that was conclusive. There was no room for a constructive, or common interest trust to be inferred, _[Stack v Dowden [2007] UKHL 17, [2007] 2 A.C. 432, [2007] 4 WLUK 407](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I20AB2C10F4AD11DB93178FA5B02D29F5/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ac871471ad3c4d649a01ce320f301a6f&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Goodman v Gallant [1986] Fam. 106, [1985] 10 WLUK 283](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB27795D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ac871471ad3c4d649a01ce320f301a6f&contextData=(sc.Search))_ and _[Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] A.C. 777, [1969] 4 WLUK 46](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1E6A7910E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ac871471ad3c4d649a01ce320f301a6f&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed (see paras [13-16](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment). A declaration of trust could be set aside on the ground of mistake, fraud, or undue influence but nothing of the kind had been alleged. If the judge had intended to find that the declaration of trust was a sham then he had been wrong to do so, _[Snook v London and West Riding Investments Ltd [1967] 2 Q.B. 786, [1967] 1 WLUK 724](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB010D990E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=ac871471ad3c4d649a01ce320f301a6f&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed (paras [17-22](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). An order for sale was made with the parties entitled to the proceeds in equal shares.
