# Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold [1989] Ch 1

## Abstract

The reservation of a rent is not necessary for the creation of a tenancy.

In 1973 R sold to M a headlease and sublease of premises in Kensington. The sale agreement provided by clause 5 that R could remain in the premises without payment of rent as "Licensees" until M should give one quarter's notice in writing and should certify that it was ready at the expiration of such notice to redevelop the premises; and further provided by clause 6 that upon completion of such redevelopment M should grant to R "a lease of a shop in a prime position at the development with an area available for trading of approximately 1,000 s.m. and with car parking facilities â€¦". M subsequently sold the headlease and sublease to the freeholder A, who claimed that R were licensees only and sought possession. R claimed that the agreement with M created a tenancy which took effect as an overriding interest under the [Land Registration Act 1925 s.70(1)(g)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39ECF620E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default)) ; alternatively that, if they were licensees only, the licence was binding upon A by reason of the decision in _[Errington v Errington and Woods [1952] 1 K.B. 290, [1951] 12 WLUK 64](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA1EAAD60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , or by reason of the doctrine of constructive trust. The judge held that the agreement had created a licence only, but that the licence had been binding upon A; and he refused to order possession.

Held, dismissing A's appeal upon other grounds, that

(1) the reservation of a rent is not necessary for the creation of a tenancy;

(2) the period of the occupation agreement was sufficiently certain in that the agreement could be determined by both parties in circumstances in which there could be no doubt as to whether the determining event had occurred;

(3) the agreement had accordingly created a tenancy, which took effect as an overriding interest under s.70(1)(g) of the 1925 Act;

(4) clause 6 of the agreement was sufficiently clear to be capable of enforcement as a contract, and likewise took effect as an overriding interest under s. 70(1)(g), notwithstanding that it had not been registered, as an estate contract, since R were in actual occupation of the premises ( _[Street v Mountford [1985] A.C. 809, [1985] 5 WLUK 8](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC01CD230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Midland Railway Co's Agreement, Re [1971] Ch. 725, [1971] 1 WLUK 516](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFA6B89A0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered; _[Lace v Chantler [1944] K.B. 368, [1944] 2 WLUK 24](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID6547E50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished).

(i) In view of the decisions in _[Thomas v Sorrell 124 E.R. 1098, [1672] 1 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I06289900E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _Daly v Edwardes (1900) 83 L.T. 548, [1900] 1 WLUK 2_ , _[Frank Warr & Co v London CC [1904] 1 K.B. 713, [1904] 3 WLUK 53](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA90EFC40E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[King v David Allen & Sons Billposting Ltd [1916] 2 A.C. 54, [1916] 2 WLUK 37](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID428C4B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , and _Clore v Theatrical Properties Ltd [1936] 3 All E.R. 483, [1936] 10 WLUK 25_ , a contractual license does not create an interest in land capable of binding third parties; and the decision in Errington was to this extent only per incuriam ( _[Winter Garden Theatre (London) Ltd v Millennium Productions Ltd [1948] A.C. 173, [1947] 7 WLUK 97](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I08DEEB70E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth [1965] A.C. 1175, [1965] 5 WLUK 32](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0AA43790E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ also considered);

(ii) Neither could a mere contractual licence in this case have bound A by way of constructive trust, since the courts will not impose a constructive trust unless it is satisfied that the conscience of the estate owner is affected; and the mere fact that land is expressed to be conveyed "subject to" a contract does not necessarily imply that the grantee is to be under an obligation, not otherwise existing, to give effect to the provisions of that contract ( _[London CC v Allen [1914] 3 K.B. 642, [1914] 5 WLUK 85](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE2B2FF50E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Bannister v Bannister [1948] 2 All E.R. 133, [1948] 6 WLUK 21](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I36FD2E60E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=927c4a55cb9f428481dfcf0ff934c62c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Schebsman (Deceased) Ex p.
