# Hunt v Luck [1902] 1 Ch 428 1

The plaintiff's husband executed a conveyance of freehold property to an auctioneer. No part of the purchase-money was in fact paid, and the husband remained the true owner of the property. The tenants of the property continued to pay their rents to the husband. However, the auctioneer obtained advances to himself on the security of the property and executed legal mortgages of it to the defendants. The defendants had no express notice that the auctioneer was trustee of the property on behalf of the husband, or that the husband was in receipt of the rents. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants to have the conveyance cancelled. The Court of Appeal held that it was not the duty of a purchaser or mortgagee to inquire of the tenants as to whom they paid their rents, either under s 3 of the Conveyance Act 1882 or under the law as it stood independently of that Act. Accordingly, the plaintiff's action had to be dismissed.
