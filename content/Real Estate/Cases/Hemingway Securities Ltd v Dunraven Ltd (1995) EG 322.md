# Hemingway Securities Ltd v Dunraven Ltd (1995) EG 322

A lease contained a covenant against assignment without the prior consent of the landlord, where such consent was not to be unreasonably withheld. It was also a precondition of any subletting that there be a covenant entered into between the landlord and the subtenants. In breach of the covenant, the first defendants, the tenants under the lease, granted a sublease to the second defendants, who had knowledge of the covenant. The landlord sought a mandatory injunction against the sublease.

Held, awarding the injunction, that this was a plain case of breach of contract by the first defendants. Furthermore there was a plain case of aiding and assisting a breach of contract by the second defendants. A covenant against alienation or subletting can be properly defined as a restrictive covenant, _[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Kingswood Motors (Addlestone) Ltd [1974] Q.B. 142, [1973] 4 WLUK 86](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA214A390E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fc782c3918ca45b3a25f2424230cd1e7&contextData=(sc.Search))_ referred to.
