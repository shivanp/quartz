# National & Provincial Building Society v Lloyd [1996] 1 All ER 630

L, an estate agent, was appointed by N in May 1992 to act as its agent and in June 1992 borrowed GBP 280,000 from N. The loan was secured by charges on L's farm and premises in Dorset. Mortgages were executed in respect of both properties. L soon fell into arrears on the loan and in March 1994 N obtained an order for possession. L appealed against this order. L's appeal was upheld in May 1995, on the basis of affidavit evidence which showed that L expected to complete sales of sufficient portions of his farm and other properties to repay the entire debt to N by June 1996, and the possession order was suspended until June 1996. N appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal and removing the suspension, that

(1) there was no rule of law to the effect that the power under the [Administration of Justice Act 1970 s.36](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF860C280E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=250978937c8c42faba14417a913d4a79&contextData=(sc.Default)) to adjourn or suspend a possession order would only be exercised, in the case of the sale of mortgaged property, if the sale would be taking place within a short period of time. The question was whether the sale would take place within a "reasonable period", and that depended on the individual facts of each case. If there was clear evidence that the completion of the sale of a property would take place in six months or even a year there was no reason why a court could not conclude that the "mortgagor was likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any sums due under the mortgage" and

(2) where the mortgaged property was to be sold and there were no known outside assets, a mortgagor must put clear evidence before a court to establish that he was "likely" to be able to repay the sums due within a reasonable period, _[Royal Trust Co of Canada v Markham [1975] 1 W.L.R. 1416, [1975] 7 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9082FFE0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=250978937c8c42faba14417a913d4a79&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. A mortgagor's affidavit in which it is simply stated that property was being or had been put on the market was not sufficient. The evidence in the instant case in relation to the critical part of the relevant property took the form of a mere intention to place that property on the market.
