# Elitestone Ltd v Morris [1997] 2 All E.R. 513

A wooden bungalow was not attached to the land, but rested on concrete pillars. It was held to be a fixture because in order to remove it from the land it would have had to be demolished.

## Abstract

E, the freehold owners of the land, planned redevelopment and issued proceedings for possession against all occupiers of the bungalows on the land. M, an occupier of one of the bungalows, claimed a declaration that he was a tenant, occupying the premises as his residence and was thereby protected by the [Rent Act 1977](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60427F90E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d6b5d034edd548c5bc0bc2fe11811a62&contextData=(sc.Search)). It was found that the bungalow formed part of the realty and that M was entitled to the declaration sought. The Court of Appeal overturned that decision finding that as the bungalow rested without attachment on concrete pillars, it was not part of the realty and was regarded as a chattel with the ownership of the sites remaining in E as freeholder, so that M was not a protected tenant. Its decision was also influenced by the uncertainty of M's tenure. M appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the bungalow was not similar to a mobile home and could only be removed by being demolished. The issue before the court was whether the bungalow was a chattel or part of the realty. The distinction between chattels and fixtures was avoided and the classification as given in Woodfall “Landlord and Tenants” Release 36 (1994) Vol.1 pp.13/83 para.13.131 adopted. Thus, the degree and object of the annexation were the determinative factors. That there was no direct attachment between the bungalow and land did not prevent the application of the principle of accession, _[Holland v Hodgson (1871-72) L.R. 7 C.P. 328, [1872] 5 WLUK 58](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC2CC0920E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d6b5d034edd548c5bc0bc2fe11811a62&contextData=(sc.Search))_. Further, the intention of the parties is to be assessed objectively and is relevant only to the degree and purpose of annexation and against the background of all the circumstances of the case, Melluish (Inspector of Taxes) v BMI (No.3) Ltd [1996] 1 A.C. 454, [1996] 1 C.L.Y. 1297 followed; _[Deen v Andrews (1986) 52 P. & C.R. 17, [1985] 5 WLUK 237](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I96262270E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d6b5d034edd548c5bc0bc2fe11811a62&contextData=(sc.Search))_ distinguished.
