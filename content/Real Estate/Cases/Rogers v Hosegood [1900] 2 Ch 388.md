# Rogers v Hosegood [1900] 2 Ch 388

The Court of Appeal, Civil Division held that, when the benefit of a restrictive covenant was once clearly annexed to one piece of land, there was a presumption that it passed by an assignment of that land. It might be said to run with the land in equity as well as at law, without proof of special bargain or representation on the assignment of the land. The covenant in such a case ran with the land because the assignee purchased something which inhered in or was annexed to the land which he bought. The purchaser's ignorance of the existence of the covenant did not defeat the presumption, though it might be rebutted by proof of facts inconsistent with it.
