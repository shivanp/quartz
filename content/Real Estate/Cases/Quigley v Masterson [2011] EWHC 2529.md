# Quigley v Masterson [2011] EWHC 2529

FACTS: Mr Pilkington and Mrs Masterson lived together in a house which they held as beneficial joint tenants. The relationship broke down, and Mr Pilkington instructed his solicitor to sever the joint tenancy by notice in writing. Unfortunately, they did not serve it properly, and it was ineffective. Mr Pilkington’s health deteriorated, and he lost mental capacity. His daughter, Mrs Quigley, successfully applied to the Court of Protection to be his ‘deputy’ after a contested hearing, but Mr Pilkington died before anything was done about the property. Mrs Masterson argued that he died as a joint tenant and that therefore she took the property by survivorship.

HELD: Mrs Quigley’s argument that the joint tenancy had been severed in the contested proceedings by another method (mutual conduct of Mrs Quigley and Mrs Masterson) was rejected, as Mrs Quigley’s conduct prior to her appointment was irrelevant.

However, the court said that papers which had been filed by Mrs Masterson as part of the contested Court of Protection application showed her belief that she and Mr Pilkington each owned a 50% share in the property as tenants in common. This indicated her intention to sever the joint tenancy immediately. Mr Pilkington therefore was a tenant in common at his death.

## Summary

A joint tenant's application to the Court of Protection to be joined to proceedings in relation to the affairs of the other joint tenant was capable of qualifying as a notice of severance under the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.36(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38D40C10E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2c432f80cc7d446b90744917ce99a0a9&contextData=(sc.Default)), as it gave unambiguous notice of the desire to sever the joint tenancy.

## Abstract

The appellant executrix (Q), of the deceased (D), appealed against a decision of the deputy adjudicator that there had been no severance of a joint tenancy held by D and the respondent (M).

D and M had lived together and owned a property as joint tenants. The relationship broke down and M left the property. D instructed solicitors who purported to serve notice to sever the tenancy on M. D's health subsequently deteriorated and Q, who was D's daughter, applied to the Court of Protection for an order authorising her to apply D's money and to sell the property. M applied for permission to be joined in the proceedings stating that she owned 50 per cent of the property and for the property to be valued with the proceeds divided between her and D. It was directed that M should have conduct of the sale of the property and Q be made deputy of D's affairs. Before any action to sell the property could be taken D died. A dispute arose as to whether the joint tenancy had been severed. The deputy adjudicator ruled that it had not been severed. The issue for determination was whether M's application constituted notice pursuant to the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.36(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38D40C10E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2c432f80cc7d446b90744917ce99a0a9&contextData=(sc.Default)) and also operated as a severance of the joint tenancy.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

There was no reason why M's application to the Court of Protection should not qualify as a notice of severance under s.36(2). Read in the context of the proceedings, it gave unambiguous notice of M's desire, at the time, to sever the joint tenancy. M's acceptance that D was entitled to a half share in the property would have been reasonably understood by Q, or any other person upon whom the application was served, as a present, unconditional and unambiguous notice to sever, _[Harris v Goddard [1983] 1 W.L.R. 1203, [1983] 7 WLUK 243](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBA5C2770E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2c432f80cc7d446b90744917ce99a0a9&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. The application was not served on D in any of the ways permitted under [s.196](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I398BEA60E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2c432f80cc7d446b90744917ce99a0a9&contextData=(sc.Default)). However, the position changed when the court ordered that Q should be made D's deputy for his affairs. It was right to regard Q as having sufficient authority to receive a notice of severance on D's behalf from the time she was appointed deputy and since she knew of M's application the notice could and should be treated as having been given to her for the purposes of s.36(2) (see paras [33-35](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment)
