# Donovan v Rana [2014] EWCA Civ 99

## Summary

An easement was implied into the transfer of a building plot allowing the transferee and his successors in title access to a plot of land to install and maintain connections to the public utility services in the road. The easement was necessary to achieve the inferred common intention of the parties that the building of a dwelling-house on the building plot would have included the connection to mains utility services across the obvious route.

## Abstract

The appellants (D) appealed against the dismissal of their claim for damages against the respondents (R) for having dug up a small plot of land ("the blue land") forming part of D's property to connect utilities to R's building plot.

At auction D had sold the building plot adjoining their property with an express right of way over the blue land which separated the building plot from the road. The transfer granted an express right to pass over the blue land "for all purposes connected with the use and enjoyment of the land but not for any other purpose". It included a provision that, save for any express rights of way or access, no rights of way or access for the benefit of the property over the blue land would be "expressly implied granted or reserved". R were the successors in title to the original purchasers of the building plot and built a house on it. Without D's express permission, R allowed workmen to dig up the blue land in order to connect their utilities to the mains service a few metres away in the road. The judge dismissed D's claim on the basis that it was the common intention of the parties to the original transfer of the building plot that it would be used to build a house with modern facilities connected up to the street. He held that there was an implication of a right to connect through the blue land and that, once a common intention to install utility connections had been established, it followed that rights of access that had already been granted could be used for putting in those connections.

D submitted that (1) the transfer expressly excluded any further rights of access so that the judge was wrong to imply an easement that included further rights; (2) the judge was wrong to infer an intention that any house built on the building plot would be connected to all normal utilities and to have found an implied grant of easements that far exceeded what was necessary to give effect to the common intention of building a house.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The judge was right to hold that the express provisions of the transfer did not exclude the implied easement which he held to exist. The transferee was granted an express right of way over the blue land for the use and enjoyment of the land and one such purpose was the laying of connections to utilities. Accordingly, if there was an easement of necessity allowing such connections to be laid or maintained, a right of way to facilitate it would already exist on the blue land. The proposed easement did not violate the inhibitions stated in the transfer (see paras [16-18](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The amended defence had pleaded an inferred and implied easement of necessity. The blue land was undoubtedly intended for access to both properties. It was clear from the auction particulars that the purpose of the transfer was to enable the transferee to build a dwelling-house on the building plot. The suggestion that such a dwelling-house might sensibly be expected by the parties to be constructed without connections to the mains utilities was optimistic. The judge was right, applying Lord Parker's second test in _[Pwllbach Colliery Co Ltd v Woodman [1915] A.C. 634, [1915] 2 WLUK 91](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2E08E2D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=46aed9f977514be68f771036e0130057&contextData=(sc.Search))_, the parties must be taken to have intended that the building of a dwelling-house on the building plot would have included the connection to mains utility services across the obvious route of the blue land, Pwllbach and _[Stafford v Lee (1993) 65 P. & C.R. 172, [1992] 11 WLUK 136](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBDF02E30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=46aed9f977514be68f771036e0130057&contextData=(sc.Search))_ followed. The easement proposed was necessary to achieve the parties' expressly intended purpose. It was not seeking to manufacture a necessity out of what was merely reasonable or desirable (paras [26-29, 32-33](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The easement was to be implied into the transfer allowing the transferee and his successors in title access to the blue land to install and maintain connections to the public utility services in the road (para.[34](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
