# State Bank of India v Sood [1997] Ch. 276

The first and second defendants were registered proprietors of land on which they executed a second legal charge in favour of S as security for all their present and future liabilities. S, claiming that substantial debts under the legal charge remained unsatisfied, brought possession proceedings in which the third to seventh defendants argued that they had equitable interests in the property as their main residence and that they had overriding interests under the [Land Registration Act 1925 s.70(1)(g)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I39ECF620E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a28e26b5ab474515a441e83d726bc938&contextData=(sc.Search)) . They also contended that, because no capital money had been paid over by S at the time the mortgage was made, their interests were not overreached by the legal charge in terms of the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.2(1)(ii)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38C08410E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a28e26b5ab474515a441e83d726bc938&contextData=(sc.Search)) . S argued that there was no requirement that capital money and disposition should arise at the same time. The judge refused to strike out parts of the defence to the claim for possession, and S appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that, on the true construction of the [Law of Property Act 1925](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60CA4D31E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a28e26b5ab474515a441e83d726bc938&contextData=(sc.Search)) s.2(1)(ii), compliance with the statutory requirements concerning the payment of capital money was only required if capital money arose. It followed that it was not necessary for capital money to have arisen under the conveyance. Notwithstanding their occupation of the property, the beneficial interests of the third to seventh defendants were overreached.
