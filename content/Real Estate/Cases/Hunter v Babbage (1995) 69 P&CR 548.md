# Hunter v Babbage (1995) 69 P&CR 548

```ad-summary
The mutual agreement was evidenced by the draft consent order in divorce proceedings. The shares were equal, based on the number of joint tenants: the rule in **Goodman v Gallant** prevailed over the terms of the draft consent order.
```

**FACTS:** Mr Babbage and Mrs Allen (formerly Mrs Babbage) owned their home as beneficial joint tenants. In the course of divorce proceedings, Mrs Allen applied for a property adjustment order. She stated that the fairest way of dealing with the house would be for it to be sold, and the proceeds split in such a way as to give her the larger share, to enable her to buy a small flat, with the rest going to Mr Babbage. After negotiations, an agreement was reached and the terms were incorporated in a draft consent order (often used in family law cases). The consent order had not been finalised when Mr Babbage died.

**HELD:** The judge decided that there was no notice in writing, nor was there a mutual course of conduct evidencing an intention to sever.

He then considered severance by mutual agreement, and held that reaching an agreement to deal with property in such a way which involves severance was sufficient to sever. The consent order, which was proposing a split other than in equal shares, was of no effect, because it had not been sealed by the court.

However, the fact that the draft consent order had been made was enough to sever into equal shares.

Where there is an agreement to sever a joint tenancy, the severance operates independently of the agreement so that where one party dies before the agreement has been implemented, the surviving joint tenant will hold the property in equal shares with the deceased's estate and not in accordance with the terms of the unenforceable agreement.

H and W owned their matrimonial home as beneficial joint tenants. There was a breakdown of the marriage and a divorce sought. A Calderbank letter between the parties' solicitors sought to have W agree to an amount of money in return for the extinction of her interest in the matrimonial home; however, final agreement on division of matrimonial home was not reached before H died. The issue arose whether the joint tenancy was severed and further whether the unenforceable agreement or a course of mutual dealing with the property constituted a severance.

Held, that the joint tenancy had been severed at common law and the parties held the property in equal shares. W's affidavit in support of her application for ancillary relief in the course of divorce proceedings was capable of being sufficient notice of an intention to sever the joint tenancy. However, the affidavit expressed an intention to sever in the future and therefore could not constitute an immediate severance under the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.36](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I38D40C10E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=fde3edfed4c14003afedd845b7ca4b75&contextData=(sc.Search)). The correspondence showed an intention to sever the joint tenancy by agreement but the agreement was never finalised. Given that the agreement was not finalised, the parties held in equal shares rather than in accordance with the terms of the purported agreement.
