# R v Tower Hamlets LBC ex parte Von Goetz [1999] QB 1019

THLBC appealed against a ruling, (1998) 30 H.L.R. 950, allowing VG's application for judicial review of THLBC's decision that her equitable interest in the residue of a 10 year assured shorthold tenancy not executed under deed was insufficient for her to be eligible for a renovation grant under the [Local Government and Housing Act 1989](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5FF3EA61E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=17b3a1118e0241ed9901b81aea2a1990&contextData=(sc.Default)). THLBC argued that the requirement in s.104(2)(b) for an applicant to have an "owner's interest" could only be satisfied where the applicant had a legal rather than an equitable interest in land.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that, while the phrase "a term of years absolute" was not further defined in s.104(2) of the 1989 Act, the definition of a term of years absolute in the [Law of Property Act 1925 s.205(1)(xxvii)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I3990CC60E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=17b3a1118e0241ed9901b81aea2a1990&contextData=(sc.Default)) did not require a legal estate and the notion of an equitable term of years absolute was contemplated by s.149(2) of that Act. Accordingly, the judge below had been correct to hold that a term of years absolute could apply to an equitable interest as well as a legal interest. Furthermore, the objective of the 1989 Act supported the conclusion that, for practical purposes, VG's interest was as good as a legal interest. Accordingly, for the purposes of s.104(2)(b) of the 1989 Act, an equitable interest in property for a term with not less than five years remaining unexpired on the lease was enough to give VG an "owner's interest".
