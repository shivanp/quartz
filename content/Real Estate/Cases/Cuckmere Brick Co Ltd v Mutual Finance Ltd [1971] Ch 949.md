# Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd [1971] Ch 949

Facts: Two planning permissions had been granted for the mortgaged property. The lender repossessed the property and sold it at auction. Just before the auction, the lender discovered that the sales particulars only mentioned one of the planning permissions but decided not to reprint the brochures. Damages were awarded amounting to the difference in the price actually obtained and the price which could have been obtained had the planning permission been disclosed.
