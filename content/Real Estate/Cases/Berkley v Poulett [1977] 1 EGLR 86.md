# Berkley v Poulett [1977] 1 EGLR 86

The court applied the usual tests as to whether objects were chattels or fixtures and held, that pictures fixed in the recesses of the panelling of rooms, a marble statue on a plinth, and a sundial resting on a stone baluster were not fixtures which passed to the purchaser of a house but chattels that the vendor could remove.
