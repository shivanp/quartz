# Expert Clothing (Services and Sales) Ltd v Hillgate House Ltd [1986] Ch 340

**FACTS:** The claimant landlord granted a twenty-five-year lease to the defendant tenant. The defendant obtained the landlord’s consent to convert the premises into a gym and health club. The lease contained an express forfeiture clause. In the first year of the lease, the defendant failed to pay the rent and the claimant re-possessed the property. The defendant obtained relief from forfeiture subject to a variation to the lease that the defendant had to  
(a) notify the claimant whether it was going to convert the property into an office or a gym,  
(b) substantially complete the alterations by 28 September 1982 and  
(c) fully complete the alterations as soon as reasonably possible after that date.

No works were carried out to the property and the claimant refused to accept the rent due on the next quarter date. The claimant's solicitor served a s 146 notice on the defendant. The s 146 notice specified that the defendant was (amongst other breaches) in breach of the covenant to carry out the alterations by the necessary date and stated that the breach of the alterations covenant was incapable of remedy. The claimant brought proceedings to obtain possession of the property. The defendant claimed relief from forfeiture. The judge at first instance held that the breach of the alterations covenant was incapable of remedy and he granted an order for possession in favour of the claimant. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the breaches were capable of remedy and that the s 146 notice was therefore invalid.

**LORD JUSTICE SLADE**

…

Nevertheless, I would, for my part, accept Mr. Neuberger's submission that the breach of a positive covenant (whether it be a continuing breach or a once and for all breach) will ordinarily be capable of remedy. As Bristow J. pointed out in the course of argument, the concept of capability of remedy for the purpose of section 146 must surely be directed to the question whether the harm that has been done to the landlord by the relevant breach is for practicable purposes capable of being retrieved. In the ordinary case, the breach of a promise to do something by a certain time can for practical purposes be remedied by the thing being done, even out of time. For these reasons I reject the plaintiffs' argument that the breach of the covenant to reconstruct by 28 September 1982 was not capable of remedy merely because it was not a continuing breach…

… In my judgment, on the remediability issue, the ultimate question for the court was this: if the section 146 notice had required the lessee to remedy the breach and the lessors had then allowed a reasonable time to elapse to enable the lessee fully to comply with the relevant covenant, would such compliance, coupled with the payment of any appropriate monetary compensation, have effectively remedied the harm which the lessors had suffered or were likely to suffer from the breach? If, but only if, the answer to this question was "No," would the failure of the section 146 notice to require remedy of the breach have been justifiable. In Rugby School (Governors) v. Tannahill [1935] 1 K.B. 87 … and Hoffmann v. Fineberg [1949] Ch. 245 the answer to this question plainly would have been "No." In the present case, however, for the reasons already stated, I think the answer to it must have been "Yes." …

**HELD:** The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the defendant’s appeal. This case also highlights the importance of drafting the s 146 notice correctly
