# Consequences of Exchange

## Effects

A binding contract exists from which normally neither party may withdraw without incurring liability for breach. At common law, the beneficial ownership in the property passes to the buyer, who becomes entitled to any increase in value of the property but bears the risk of any loss damage.

The seller retains legal title until completion, but holds the beneficial interest on behalf of the buyer. Seller entitled to remain in possession of the property and to any rental income, unless otherwise agreed. Must pay any outgoings until completion. Owes a duty of care to the buyer, and liable in damages if loss is caused through neglect or destruction ([[Clarke v Ramuz [1891] 2 QB 456]]; [[Phillips v Lamdin [1949] 2 KB 33]]). Duty does not terminate even if the seller vacates the property before completion.

## Immediately After

- Seller's solicitor
	- Should inform the client that exchange has happened.
	- If exchange telephonic, copy of the contract signed by seller immediately sent to buyer's solicitor (to fulfil any undertaking given during the phone call).
	- Any received deposit immediately paid into client deposit account.
- Buyer's solicitor
	- Inform client and lender that exchange has happened
	- If exchange telephonic, send seller's solicitor the signed contract and deposit cheque in accordance with the undertaking given, after checking the contract is dated and contains the agreed completion date.
	- Protect the contract by registration, where appropriate.

## Registration of Contract

In practice, registration is uncommon since completion often takes place shortly after exchange But should be registered if:

- There is a long delay (>2 months) before exchange and completion
- Reason to doubt the seller's good faith
- Dispute between seller and buyer
- Seller delays completion beyond the contractual date.

Registered land: protect by entry of a notice on the register of title.

## Buyer in Possession

### Buyer's Occupation Before Completion

Seller entitled to retain possession until completion, unless otherwise agreed. Buyer's request to enter and occupy the premises before completion should be regarded with caution (loss of incentive to complete on time, hard to regain possession of property if required).

If the buyer is allowed to possess before completion, ensure the buyer's occupation is as licensee and not a tenant, to avoid security of tenure issues.

SCPCs contain no provisions allowing a buyer to take possession prior to completion, nor any provisions regulating such occupation.

## Tenanted Property

- SCPC 5.2.6: seller not to give or formally withhold any licence or approve under the lease without the buyer's consent.
- SCPC 6.1.5: neither party is to agree a new rent figure unless the other agrees.

## Death of a Contracting Party

Death of one of the contracting parties between contract and completion does not affect the validity of the contract. Benefit and burden of the contract pass to the deceased's personal representatives, who are bound to complete.

If completion does not take place by the contractual completion date, there is a breach of contract. If time was not originally of the essence, may be made so by service of a notice to complete addressed to the deceased and executors named in the seller's will. A copy of the notice must be sent to the Public Trustee.

### Death of Co-seller

- Property owned by beneficial co-owners is held on a trust of land.
- If following death there remain $\geq 2$ trustees of the legal estate, the transaction can proceed to completion.
- Else, (for a beneficial joint tenancy) appoint another trustee, so there are at least 2.

### Death of Buyer

Personal representatives of the deceased bound to complete the contract. Delay in completion may occur:

- Transfer deed will need redrafting
- PRs cannot complete until they have obtained a grant of representation
- Mortgage offer usually revoked.
- Survivor of joint buyers can be forced to complete.

## Pre-completion Steps

1. Preparation of the transfer deed
2. Redemption of seller's mortgage and creation of buyer's mortgage
3. Pre-completion searches by the buyer
4. Ensuring financial aspects in order.

Conventionally 4 weeks between exchange and completion, but 2 weeks or less not uncommon. Sometimes exchange and completion are simultaneous.
