# Pre-completion Searches

## Bankruptcy Searches

### Against buyer/ Borrower

Lender will require a clear bankruptcy search against the name of the buyer/ borrower before releasing mortgage funds. Unless a full search of the register has been made on Form K15, the lender's solicitor should submit Form K16 electronically to Land Registry, completed with full and correct names of the borrower. A search certificate will be returned. If there is an adverse entry revealed, lender's instructions must be immediately obtained.

> [!conduct]
> If the bankruptcy search reveals an adverse entry, the buyer's solicitor can certify that the entry does not relate to the borrower (relates to someone else with the same name). But this is construed as an undertaking given by the solicitor. 

Can also check Insolvency Service website, which will also reveal date of birth.

### Against the Seller

For registered land, most conveyancing solicitors do not consider a bankruptcy check on an individual seller necessary. s 86(5) LRA 2002 provides that where no notice or restriction relating to bankruptcy appears on the title, a buyer for value acting in good faith without notice of the bankruptcy petition will take good title from the bankruptcy seller. May be worth doing in a v high value transaction.

## Company Search

May be done as a pre-contract search. Update at this stage of the transaction.

## Powers of Attorney

If the transfer deed is to be executed by a person acting under the authority of an enduring or lasting power of attorney, do a search with the Office of Public Guardian to check whether or not registration of the power is effected/ pending.

| Power    | Registered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Pending                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enduring | Transaction may proceed to completion, provided the buyer has no actual knowledge of any circumstances that would revoke the power. Power no longer revocable without notification to the Public Guardian. Office copy of the power should be obtained from the Office of Public Guardian. | Do not proceed. Suggests mental incapacity of the donor. |
| Lasting  | As above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Do not proceed. Only comes into effect once registered.                                                          |

## Local Land Searches and Enquiries

Searches invariably made before exchange of contracts. Only repeat prior to completion if:

1. $> 2$ months between exchange and completion and the search is not covered/ replaced by insurance.
2. Information received by the buyer's solicitor suggests a further search may be advisable.
3. Contract conditional on the satisfactory results of later searches.

## Inspection of the Property

May be necessary just before completion.

## Results of Searches

If the searches reveal something unexpected:

- Contact the seller's solicitor immediately to find out exactly what the issue is and if it can be rectified before completion.
- For a Land Charges Department search, apply for an official copy of the entry using Form K19 (reveal name and address of the person with the benefit of the charge).
- Keep the client, lender and other solicitors involved informed.

### Removing Entry From the Register

An application form for the removal of an entry from the register in either registered or unregistered land will be accepted by the Chief Land Registrar only if it is signed by the person with the benefit of the charge or a person acting on his behalf.

An application form signed by the sellerâ€™s solicitors, or an undertaking given by them on completion to secure the removal of the charge may not, therefore, suffice, unless the seller is the person with the benefit of the charge (see Holmes v Kennard (H) and Son (A Firm) (1985) 49 P & CR 202).

### Irrelevant Land Charges Entries

Charges registered at the Land Charges Department can only validly be entered against the name of an estate owner in relation to the period in which he owned the land in question. Sometimes the system throws up irrelevant ones. Often seller's solicitor asked to certify that an entry is irrelevant (undertaking).

### Entries That Cannot Be Removed

If a seller is unwilling/ unable to remove an adverse entry revealed by a pre-completion search, check contract terms to see if seller is in breach.

### Official Certificates of Search

An official certificate of search issued by Land Registry is not conclusive in favour of the  
searcher, who will thus take his interest in the land subject to whatever entries are on the  
register, irrespective of whether or not they were revealed by the search certificate ([[Parkash v Irani Finance Ltd [1970] Ch 101]]).

## Priority Periods

An official certificate of search issued by Land Registry following a search made on Form OS1 or OS2 gives a priority period to the searcher of 30 working days from the Certificate Date in the search. The searcher will take priority over any entry made during the priority period, provided that completion takes place and a correct application for registration of the transaction is received by the appropriate Land Registry Office by 12 noon on the day when the priority period given by the search expires.

The expiry of the priority period is shown on the search certificate. Cannot be extended.
