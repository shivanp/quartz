# Freehold Covenants

![[freehold covenants_1.jpg]]

## Introduction

A covenant is a promise relating to land. Covenants are usually contained in a transfer deed made when someone sells part of their land and wants to control what happens on the land sold off. The seller makes it part of the sale deal that the buyer will enter into covenants which have the effect of preserving the amenity and value of the land retained by the seller. Covenants are in effect a means of private control of land use.

### Context

This is an area of law which arose at the time of the industrial revolution in the mid-nineteenth century, when landowners were selling part of their land for industrial and housing development. In order to preserve the quality and value of what they had left, the landowners imposed strict covenants as to what could and could not be done on the land sold off.

> [!example]
> For example, they might require the buyer to covenant not to develop the land without the consent of the seller; or may covenant not to use the land for manufacturing or industrial purposes; or may covenant to use it for residences, maybe even restricting the number of houses which can be built on the land. All of these covenants have the effect of preserving the value of the seller’s retained land because they eliminate the possibility of the adjoining land being used for a purpose which would reduce the attractiveness, quality and value of the retained land.

### Terminology

| Term          | Definition                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Covenantee    | Person who has sold part of their land and has required the buyer to enter into the covenant. The covenantee is the person entitled to sue for breach of covenant. |
| Dominant land | Land owned by the covenantee.                                                                                                                                      |
| Covenantor    | Person giving the promise and entering into the covenant. Often referred to as the grantor of the covenant. Can be sued if covenant is breached.                   |
| Servient land | Land owned by the covenantor which is burdened by the covenant.                                                                                                                                                                    |

Almost inevitably, the dominant and servient land will be sold or transferred to new owners at some point. When the dominant land is transferred, the new owner is successor-in-title to the original covenantee, and is known as the successor covenantee. If the relevant rules have been observed, that person now has the ability to sue for breach of covenant. The rules on the burden of a covenant passing to a successor covenantor are complex.

## Positive and Restrictive Covenants

Covenants impose two main types of obligation: positive and negative.

A positive covenant is a promise actively to do something.

> [!example]
> The promise to do something will usually involve spending money: it could be a direct obligation to pay money, perhaps towards the upkeep of a shared facility such as a driveway, a parking area, or a communal garden. The covenant could involve payment of money, which is not directly stated. For example, there could be an obligation for the covenantor to maintain a fence, a wall, or a roof; or to paint the exterior of a house every two years. This will inevitably involve some sort of expenditure. But it does not necessarily involve money. A covenant to keep a garden tidy may not involve expenditure but it does require time and effort to fulfil and is therefore a positive obligation.

 A negative or, more properly, a restrictive covenant is a promise not to do a specific thing on the land. It restricts the use of the land in some way.

 ```ad-example
There are many examples: not to use land for industrial, or retail, or hot food takeaways, or manufacturing; not to build above a certain height, or above a certain density of housing; not to install a window overlooking the dominant land...
```

> ‘Only such a covenant as can be complied with without expenditure of money will be enforced’ against a successor covenantor.’  
> Lindley LJ, [[Haywood v Brunswick Permanent Benefit Building Society (1881) 8 QBD 403]]

> [!test] Hand in pocket test
> 
> The test for identifying whether a covenant is positive or restrictive is set out in [[Haywood v Brunswick Permanent Benefit Building Society (1881) 8 QBD 403]]
> 
> This is known as the ‘hand in pocket’ test. If covenantors have to put their hands in their pockets to find money to spend to perform the covenant, it is positive.
> 
> ‘Time is money’ so any covenant which requires expenditure of money, effort or time falls within the definition of positive covenants’.

Deciding whether a covenant is positive or restrictive is a matter of looking at the substance not form: look beyond the words used and ask ‘what is the essence of the obligation?’

Mixed covenants, which impose positive and restrictive obligations, can be interpreted in one of two ways:

1. as separate covenants or
2. as one obligation with a condition attached

### Separate Covenants

[[Shepherd Homes Ltd v Sandham (No 2) [1971] 2 All ER 1267]]

This approach can be taken if the positive and restrictive aspects of the obligation can be separated to create two separate ‘stand alone’ covenants; one positive and one restrictive.

> [!example]
> A covenant to paint the exterior of a building every two years and not to paint the front door red
> This covenant can be split.
> - To paint the exterior every two years: positive.
> - Not to paint the front door red: restrictive.

### One Obligation with Condition

[[Powell v Hemsley [1909] 2 Ch 252]]

This approach is taken if the mixed covenant cannot be split into two separate obligations.

The covenant is interpreted as being overall positive or restrictive, depending on whether it obliges the covenantor to do or not do something.

The additional element, which cannot stand alone as a covenant, is viewed as being simply a condition attached to an overall positive or restrictive obligation.

> [!example]
> A covenant not to build on the servient land without the consent of the dominant owner. This covenant cannot be split. 
> - Not to build’ is the main obligation: restrictive covenant.
> - ‘Without consent’ is not a stand alone obligation. Seeking consent only operates as part of the main obligation: positive condition attached.

## Enforceability of Freehold Covenants

Suppose there is a covenant between A and B. Suppose A sells the dominant land to C and B sells the servient land to D. There is now no direct legal relationship between C and D; there is no contract between them. This presents a problem for enforceability.

To enforce such a covenant, it must be shown that:

- C has the benefit of the covenant, and
- D has the burden of the covenant.

There are two sets of rules which must be applied to see whether the benefit and burden have passed to the successor covenantee and covenantor, respectively. One set is the rules of equity, and the other is the common law rules. It is vitally important that these rules are not muddled or used on a mix and match basis. It is not possible, for example, to apply the common law rules to pass the benefit to C and the rules of equity to pass the burden to D. If the equity rules are applied to pass the burden, then they must be applied to pass the benefit.

## Equitable Rules: Burden

As a general rule, the burden of a covenant does not pass to a successor at common law: [[Austerberry v Oldham Corporation [1885] AC 29 ChD 750]]. This means that at common law, the covenant is unenforceable against a successor in title to the covenantor.

Equity has developed rules which allow the burden of certain covenants to pass to successors, which allows the covenant to be enforced direct against the person in breach. It is equity’s intervention which has created the proprietary right, which we know as the **restrictive covenant**.

The formalities for creating a restrictive covenant are set out in [LPA 1925, s 53(1)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/53): in writing and signed by the grantor. A restrictive covenant is a proprietary right: [LPA 1925, s 1(3)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1).

> [!test] Tulk v Moxhay rules
> 
> The equitable rules began with the case of [[Tulk v Moxhay (1848) 2 Ph 774]]. There are 4 aspects to the rule:
> 1) The covenant must be restrictive
> 2) It must accommodate the dominant tenement
> 3) There must be intention for the burden to run
> 4) There must be notice of the covenant

### The Covenant Must Be Restrictive

In [[Rhone v Stephens [1994] AC 310]] Lord Templemen said

> ‘For over 100 years it has been accepted law that equity will enforce negative covenants against freehold land but has no power to enforce positive covenants against successors in title of the land’.

This means that to enforce a covenant in equity, it must be shown that the substance of the covenant is restrictive. If a covenant is positive, then the common law rules will apply to its enforcement.

Positive covenants can only be enforced at common law.

### Accommodate Dominant Tenement

There are three aspects:

1. The covenantee and successor covenantee must hold an interest in land at the time of creation and enforcement.
	- The original covenantee and successors must have retained an interest in dominant land at the time of creation and enforcement of the covenant.
	- [[LCC v Allen [1914] 3 KB 642.]]
2. The covenant must touch and concern the dominant land
	- This means that it is the land, and not simply the dominant owner, which must benefit from the covenant.
	- [[P&A Swift Investments Ltd v Combined English Stores Group plc [1989] AC 632]]
3. The dominant land and the servient land must be in proximity.
	- The two pieces of land must be near to each other, although they do not need to share a common boundary, or be directly next to each other
	- [[Bailey v Stephens (1862) 12 CB (NS) 91]]

### Intention for Burden to Run

This can be shown expressly or impliedly.

#### Expressly

The covenant is worded in such a way as to make it clear that successors are to be bound:

> [!example]
> - ‘A hereby covenants with B for himself and his successors in title to land known as…’ or
> - ‘A hereby covenants with the intention of binding land known as…’

#### Impliedly

[LPA 1925, s 79](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/79) states that a covenant relating to land shall be deemed to be made by the covenantor on behalf of his successors in title, unless a contrary intention is expressed.

The section makes the original covenantor liable for all breaches of covenant by any person who holds the land after the original covenantor has parted with it. It does not pass the burden of the covenant.

#### There Must Be Notice of the Covenant

##### Unregistered Land

The covenant must be entered as a D(ii) Land Charge ([LCA 1972 s 2(5)(ii)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/61/section/2)). If so, a purchaser will be deemed to have notice of the covenant ([LPA 1925, s 198](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/198)).

If the covenant has not been protected by entering a D(ii) Land Charge, a purchaser of a legal estate will take the land free of the covenant, they will not be bound ([LCA 1972, s 4(6)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/61/section/4)).

However, if the successor covenantor has been gifted or inherited the estate, they will still be bound despite the fact it has not been correctly protected.

Whether the successor covenantor is deemed to have notice of the covenant depends on whether it has been properly protected by registration.

##### Registered Land

The covenant must be protected by the entry of a notice in the charges register of the servient title ([LRA 2002, s 32](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/32)).

If so, everyone, including a purchaser for valuable consideration, will be bound ([s 29(2) LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/29)).

If not, a purchaser for valuable consideration will take the land free of it and would not be bound ([s 29(1) LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/29)), but a successor in title covenantor who has been gifted or inherited the land (a ‘volunteer’) will still be bound ([s 28 LRA 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/28)).

## Equitable Rules: Benefit

The various ways in which the benefit of a covenant can pass to a successor covenantee are set out.

### Context

If a successor covenantee wishes to enforce a breach against a successor covenantor direct, two things must be shown:

1. that the burden of the covenant has passed to the successor covenantor in equity and
2. that the benefit has passed to the successor covenantee in equity.

It is not enough to show that the burden has passed in equity and the benefit passes at common law. If an equitable remedy is required, both the benefit and burden must pass in equity: the rules go hand in hand.

There are two elements which must be fulfilled for the benefit to pass in equity:

1. The covenant must ‘touch and concern’ the dominant land
2. The benefit must pass by one of the methods in [[Renals v Cowlishaw (1878) 9 ChD 125]]

### Methods of Passing the Benefit

The case of [[Renals v Cowlishaw (1878) 9 ChD 125]] sets out 3 ways in which the benefit of a covenant can pass to a successor covenantee in equity:

1. Annexation
2. Assignment
3. Building Scheme

#### Annexation

> [!defn]
> Annexation occurs when the covenant is made in such a way that the benefit becomes a permanent part of the dominant land itself. It therefore passes automatically when the dominant land is sold, without being specifically mentioned in the transfer deed.

Annexation occurs in one of two main ways:

1. Express annexation

	- The words of the covenant are sufficient to make the benefit part and parcel of the dominant land from the outset.
	- This occurs where the express words of the covenant make it clear that the original parties intend the benefit to become part of the dominant land, rather than simply a personal advantage to the covenantee.
	- In [[Rogers v Hosegood [1900] 2 Ch 388]] a covenant made ‘for the benefit of the owners and successors in title’ to named land, which was enough to demonstrate express annexation.
	- In [[Renals v Cowlishaw (1878) 9 ChD 125]] a covenant stated to be made with the covenantees, their heirs, executors and assignees was not enough to show express annexation because the benefit was stated to be for people, not for land.

2. Statutory annexation [LPA 1925, s 78](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/78)

	- LPA 1925, s 78(1) was interpreted in the case of [[Federated Homes v Mill Lodge Properties Ltd [1980] 1 WLR 594]] as providing that a covenant relating to any land of the covenantee shall be deemed to be made with the covenantee and his successors in title of the land intended to be benefitted.
	- This would appear to make express words of annexation unnecessary, as it seems to make annexation automatic.
	- However, [[Roake v Chadha [1984] 1 WLR 40]] held that s 78(1) can be expressly excluded. This can happen if an alternative method of passing the benefit is stipulated in the original transfer deed.

> [!statute] s 78(1) LPA 1925
> A covenant relating to any land of the covenantee shall be deemed to be made with the covenantee and his successors in title and the persons deriving title under him or them, and shall have effect as if such successors and other persons were expressed.

#### Assignment

> [!defn]
> Assignment is the express transfer of the benefit of a covenant alongside a transfer of the dominant land.

This occurs where the benefit of the covenant has not been annexed at the outset. The benefit can nevertheless be assigned when the dominant land is transferred. As the benefit exists separately from the land itself, it is treated as a separate interest in the land and must be transferred every time the land is transferred.

The separate assignment of the benefit must comply with the formalities in [LPA 1925, s 53(1)(c)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/53): in writing and signed by the person transferring the benefit.

#### Building Scheme

> [!defn]
> If the parties intended to create a scheme of reciprocal local laws in a building scheme, the benefit of restrictive covenants passes to all new owners.

When a new housing estate is built, all houses are sold subject to the same covenants. New owners who wish to enforce a covenant against a neighbour may struggle to show that the benefit of a particular covenant has passed to them.

Building schemes resolve this problem relating to restrictive covenants only.

If the conditions of a building scheme are met, the covenants are treated as a set of by-laws enforceable by and against all owners. It is not necessary to show specifically that the benefit of a particular covenant has passed to a claimant.

> [!test] Building scheme
> The conditions are set out in [[Ellison v Reacher [1908] 2 Ch 374]]:
> 1) All buyers buy from the same seller
> 2) The seller divided the estate into plots
> 3) The covenants were intended to benefit all plots
> 4) Each buyer buys on the understanding that the covenants are intended to benefit all plots.
> 
> Later cases have interpreted these rules as **guidelines** rather than strict requirements.
> 
> A court will need to be satisfied that it was the intention of the parties to create a **scheme of mutually enforceable obligations**.

#### Original Covenantee

When dominant land is sold, the original covenantee technically still has the benefit of the covenant and can sue on it. This is based on contractual principles.

However, it is highly unlikely that an original covenantee would wish to enforce a covenant in these circumstances.

Even if action was taken, it is hard to envisage any loss which could be suffered by an original covenantee who no longer owns the dominant land.

> [!example]
> A covenant not to build on servient land is of no value to a covenantee once the dominant land is sold. A breach of the covenant causes the original covenantee no loss.

## Equitable Remedies

As a restrictive covenant is an equitable interest in land, equitable remedies are available to enforce the breach against the current owner. These remedies are discretionary, there is no automatic right to them. The most common remedy for breach of covenant is an injunction.

| Term                   | Definition                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Injunction             | An order of the court.                                              |
| Prohibitory injunction | An order requiring a person to refrain from doing a particular act. |
| Mandatory injunction   | An order to undertake a particular act.                                                                    |

Typically, if the breach is threatened or ongoing, the claimant can apply for a prohibitory injunction, ordering the breach to cease. For example, if a servient owner is using the burdened land for an unauthorised use, or is building in breach of covenant, a prohibitory injunction would be appropriate.

If the breach has already occurred, the claimant can apply for a mandatory injunction, ordering the person in breach to do something. For example, if a building has been built in breach of covenant, a mandatory injunction, ordering the demolition of the building, may be appropriate.

### Equitable Principles

Equitable remedies are awarded subject to general equitable principles and maxims. ‘Delay defeats equity’ – a claimant must not wait too long before applying for an injunction.

> [!note]
> A claimant who wishes to apply for an injunction in respect of building work being carried out in breach of covenant must act immediately. If the claimant waits until the building is complete and then applies for a mandatory injunction to knock the building down, the application is likely to be refused.

### Damages in Lieu of Injunctions

Equitable damages are not awarded as of right.

They may be awarded in lieu of an injunction, as an injunction may be refused where it would be oppressive to grant it.

Key case: [[Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes [1974] 1 WLR 798]].

## Common Law Rules: Burden

The rule in [[Tulk v Moxhay (1848) 2 Ph 774]] must be used to pass the burden of a covenant in equity. The first aspect of this is that the covenant must be negative. Therefore the rules in equity cannot be used to enforce positive covenants, or indeed any restrictive covenant which fails any of the other _Tulk v Moxhay_ tests. Only the common law can be used in these circumstances.

It must be shown that the burden has passed to a successor covenantor at common law, and that the benefit has passed to a successor covenantee at common law. It is fairly easy to show that the benefit passes at common law, and for the purposes of this explanation, we will assume that the benefit has indeed passed to C, enabling C to sue for breach of covenant.

On the assumption that C can show that the benefit has passed, the problem as far as C is concerned relates to the burden.

> [!important]
> It is the general rule at common law that the burden of the covenant does not pass ([[Austerberry v Oldham Corporation [1885] AC 29 ChD 750]]).

The effect of the rule is that at common law, C cannot sue D direct as the burden of the covenant has not passed to D. If the burden of a covenant does not pass, that does not mean that it disappears. It remains with the original covenantor permanently. This means that it is the original covenantor has the burden of the covenant and can be sued.

### Continuity

This continuity is often found expressly stated in the wording of the covenant. This can be stated in a variety of ways, but common examples are:

> [!example]
> - ‘the covenantor covenants for himself, his successors in title and all those deriving title under him or them to maintain the boundary fence…’ or
> - ‘the covenantor covenants that he and his successors in title will maintain the boundary fence…’ or
> - ‘the covenantor covenants with the intention of binding land known as 9 Main Street to maintain the boundary fence…’.

Even if there is no such express wording in the covenant itself, [LPA 1925, s 79(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/79) can be used to imply such wording. The case of [[Topham Ltd v Earl of Sefton [1967] 1 AC 50]] confirms this. So the effect is that the original covenantor will be liable for any breach of covenant by anyone who holds the servient land in the future.

### Remedies

The problem from the covenantee’s point of view is that the only remedy available against the original covenantor is damages. This may not be what the covenantee wants. For example, if the successor covenantor has breached a covenant to maintain a fence, the covenantee wants to force the successor covenantor to maintain the fence. However, that is not going to happen as the burden does not pass to the successor covenantor. If the covenantee sues the original covenantor, the original covenantor is not in possession of the land and is not therefore in a position to maintain the fence. Instead, damages may be awarded to the covenantee, but that simply awards money, and does not solve the essential problem.

Original covenantors may have awards of damages made against them for breaches of covenant that they did not commit, did not know about, and had no power to stop. Can the original covenantor do anything to recover money paid out? The answer to that question depends entirely on whether the original covenantor (B in this example) was careful (or had a careful solicitor) when B sold the servient land to D.

As part of the sale process, B should have insisted that D entered into an indemnity covenant in B’s favour. In essence, in the transfer deed, D promises that, in the event of B being sued for a breach of covenant after B parts with the servient land, D will reimburse any damages that B has had to pay out.

This means that if D has to pay out the money for, say, the dilapidated fence, maybe that will make D more likely to maintain the fence in future. This is what is meant by ‘indirect enforcement’. D cannot be sued direct, but suing B, who then recovers damages paid out from D, may encourage D to observe the covenant in future.

### Chain of Indemnities

If the servient land changes hands several times, there is potentially a ‘chain of indemnity’ as each new servient owner makes an indemnity covenant with the previous servient owner. In our continuing example, there is a covenant to maintain a boundary fence. B may sell the servient land to D, who sells to F, who sells to H. H breaches the covenant and lets the fence fall down in places. As the maintenance covenant is positive, B is sued for the breach, and pays out damages. As D has made an indemnity covenant with B when D bought, B can recover the sums paid out from D. As F has made an indemnity covenant with D when F bought, D can recover any sums paid out to B from F. Note that B cannot sue F direct as there is no direct covenant between B and F.

### Shortcomings

In this example, in the transfer from F to H, F did not ask H to enter into an indemnity covenant. This means that if H breaches covenant, B will be sued and can recover from D; D in turn can recover from F, but the chain of indemnity is then broken and F cannot recover from H. As H has not had to pay anything out, there is no incentive for H to stop breaching covenant. This is one of the problems with indemnity chains.

Moreover, F may have been declared bankrupt; or may have died; or may not be traceable. In that case, there is no practical possibility of D recovering any outlay, even though technically, everything has been done correctly.

## Exceptions to the Common Law Rule

### Mutual Benefit and Burden

[[Halsall v Brizell [1957] Ch 169]] gives a limited exception to the general rule, enabling the burden of a covenant to pass to a successor covenantor at common law.

It is known as the **‘mutual benefit and burden’ rule**, and applies where the covenantee grants to the covenantor a benefit in the nature of an easement, and imposes a connected burden.

For example, in the transfer deed selling part of a piece of land, a covenantee grants the covenantor a right to park on the covenantee’s land. In the same deed, the covenantor covenants to contribute to the cost of maintaining the parking area.

In a case like this, a successor covenantor cannot take the benefit of parking but avoid payment by relying on the basic common law rule of the burden not passing.

#### Refinements

The rules has been refined in subsequent cases:

| Case                                               | Ratio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Rhone v Stephens [1994] 2 AC 310]]               | There must be a clear link between the burden and the benefit. There is no general principle that someone who takes a benefit under a deed must submit to any burden which it imposes.                                                                     |
| [[Thamesmead Town Ltd v Allotey (1998) 3 EGLR 97]] | There must be a genuine choice as to whether or not to take the benefit. This choice can be theoretical. The condition of discharging the covenanted burden must be relevant to the exercise of the right (more than incidental). |
| [[Davies v Jones [2009] EWCA Civ 1164]]            | The benefit and burden must have been conferred in the same transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

#### Grant of Long Lease

One way of side-stepping the rule that the burden of a freehold covenant will not pass to a successor covenantor is to dispose of the land by way of long lease.

All covenants in leases except personal ones are enforceable by and against successors in title via the doctrine of privity of estate.

#### Commonhold Development

Commonhold is a way of holding land in units such as blocks of flats. Each unit owner has obligations, such as contributing towards the maintenance of each unit. The rights and obligations attach by statute ([Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/15/contents)) to each unit, so all obligations are enforceable against all unit holders at all times.

Unfortunately, commonhold has not proved a popular way of holding land.

#### Restriction: S 40 LRA 2002

> [!note]
> This is the most commonly used way of making the burden of positive covenants run on registered land.

A covenantee can put a restriction on the **proprietorship register of the burdened land**. This states that no transfer of the burdened land can be registered without the consent of the covenantee.

As a condition of giving consent to the transaction, the covenantee takes a direct covenant from the purchaser of the burdened land.

In the new covenant, the new owner promises to observe the covenants in the original transfer. This creates a new privity of contract between the covenantee and purchaser, enabling direct enforcement of the covenants.

#### Other Methods

- Reserving a rentcharge annexed to a right of entry
- Reserving a freehold right of entry
- Less commonly used.

## Common Law Rules: Benefit

The original covenantee can enforce a covenant as a matter of contract law. If the dominant land is sold, the successor covenantee must show that the benefit has passed to it at common law.

This enables the successor covenantee to enforce the covenant either against the original covenantor, or (in limited circumstances) against the successor covenantor.

There are two ways the benefit can pass at common law:

### Express Assignment

Under normal contractual principles, the benefit of a covenant can be expressly assigned to a successor.

[LPA 1925, s 136](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/136) requires the assignment must be in writing and express notice of the assignment must be given to the covenantor. This is to ensure that the covenantor realises that a new person is in a position to enforce the covenant.

### Implied Assignment

Where there is no express assignment, the benefit of a covenant may pass to a successor covenantee if certain conditions are met. This involves the benefit automatically passing every time the land is transferred, as long as the conditions are met.

> [!test] Implied assignment
> 
> The conditions of implied assignment are set out in [[P&A Swift Investments Ltd v Combined English Stores Group plc [1989] AC 632]]:
> 1. The covenant must touch and concern the land
> 2. There must have been an intention that the benefit should run with the dominant land
> 3. The original covenantee must have a legal estate in the dominant land
> 4. The successor covenantee must hold a legal estate in the dominant land

### The Covenant Must Touch and Concern the Land

The covenant must benefit the dominant land itself, it must affect the nature, quality, use or value of the land. It must not be expressed to be personal and should only benefit the dominant owner for the time being, so that, if separated from the land, it ceases to be of any advantage to them.

> [!example]
> A covenant to maintain a house on the burdened land does touch and concern the dominant land as it preserves the quality of the environment and therefore the value of the dominant land.

### Intention That Benefit Runs with Dominant Land

Intention of the parties can be shown expressly or impliedly through statute.

If there is no express intention, [LPA 1925, s 78](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/78) implies an intention for the benefit to pass unless it is expressly excluded.

> [!example]
> A covenant drafted ‘for the benefit of land known as 5 High Street’ or ‘with the covenantee and successors in title to land known as 5 High Street’ shows express intention

The original covenantee must have a legal estate in the dominant land, and the successor covenantee must hold a legal estate in the dominant land.

The original covenantee must have owned a legal estate when the covenant was made, and that the successor must own a legal estate at the time of enforcement.

The legal estate does not need to be of the same nature: [[Smith and Snipes Hall Farm Ltd v River Douglas Catchment Board [1949] 2 KB 500]].

In that case, the original covenantee held a freehold and the successor held a leasehold. The successor was held to be entitled to the benefit of the covenant and could therefore enforce it.

## Ending Freehold Covenants

The methods by which a freehold covenant can be brought to an end are discharge, modification and release.

### Problem with Old Covenants

Restrictive covenants, once validly granted, last forever. Over time, these can become obsolete and can unduly restrict the use of the servient land.

> [!example]
> A covenant not to build on land might have benefitted the dominant tenement whilst that land was used for residential purposes, but no longer does if the dominant land is now a factory.

There are various ways in which a covenant can be discharged or modified. Discharge if a covenant means that it is no longer valid.

Modification of a covenant means that the scope of the covenant is altered, but it is not completely invalidated.

### Methods of discharging/modifying Covenants

A covenant will be automatically be discharged if the same person becomes the owner of both the dominant and servient land: [[Re Tiltwood, Sussex [1978] Ch 269]].

This is known as merger. A dominant owner may expressly agree to discharge the covenant and will enter into a formal release of covenant, usually in return for a payment.

The release must be made by deed. Alternatively, the dominant owner may impliedly agree to discharge the covenant by doing nothing when the covenant is being breached openly.

### Statutory Discharge or Modification of Covenants

The dominant owner could hold the servient owner to ransom by asking for a large sum of money to discharge an obsolete covenant.

To avoid this, the servient owner can apply to the [[Tribunals#Upper Tribunal]] (Lands Chamber) for the discharge or modification of any covenant.

[Law of Property Act 1925, s 84(1)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/84) gives the Lands Chamber the power ‘wholly or partially to discharge or modify any… restriction’.

> [!warning]
> This provision only applies to restrictive covenants.

> [!statute] [LPA 1925, s 84(1)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/84)
> 
> A servient owner may apply to the tribunal for a declaration to discharge or modify a covenant on the basis that the covenant has become obsolete due to changes in the character of the property or neighbourhood.

> [!example]
> A covenant to use property only as a residence may be obsolete if the surrounding area is now business, retail of mixed use.

[s 84(1)(aa)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/84) enables an application to be made on the basis that the covenant impedes reasonable use of the servient land. The applicant must show either that the covenant confers no practical value, or that it is contrary to public interest.

The tribunal must be satisfied that financial compensation would be adequate for the dominant owner.

> [!example]
> A covenant restricting the density of houses on a plot may confer no practical value on the dominant land if that land is itself densely developed.

S 84(1)(b) applies where the dominant owners have agreed, expressly or impliedly, to discharge.

> [!example]
> An application here may be appropriate where the parties have expressly agreed a release in principle, or where the dominant owner has tolerated a long-term breach. In this instance, the tribunal will decide the level of compensation to be paid, thereby preventing the dominant owner holding the servient owner to ransom.

S 84(1)(c) enables an application to be made where discharge if a covenant will not 'injure' the dominant owners.

This provision means that the tribunal can override spurious or frivolous objections.

However, the tribunal has a balancing act to do: on the one hand it will be wary of discharging covenants on this basis simply because discharge will not injure the current dominant owner. On the other hand it will have regard to social and economic concerns: the wider public interest rather than the interest of one particular dominant owner.
