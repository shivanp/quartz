# Consequences of Exchange

## Effects

A binding contract exists from which normally neither party may withdraw without incurring liability for breach. At common law, the beneficial ownership in the property passes to the buyer, who becomes entitled to any increase in value of the property but bears the risk of any loss damage.

The seller retains legal title until completion, but holds the beneficial interest on behalf of the buyer. Seller entitled to remain in possession of the property and to any rental income, unless otherwise agreed. Must pay any outgoings until completion. Owes a duty of care to the buyer, and liable in damages if loss is caused through neglect or destruction ([[Clarke v Ramuz [1891] 2 QB 456]]; [[Phillips v Lamdin [1949] 2 KB 33]]). Duty does not terminate even if the seller vacates the property before completion.

## Immediately After

- Seller's solicitor
	- Should inform the client that exchange has happened.
	- If exchange telephonic, copy of the contract signed by seller immediately sent to buyer's solicitor (to fulfil any undertaking given during the phone call).
	- Any received deposit immediately paid into client deposit account.
- Buyer's solicitor
	- Inform client and lender that exchange has happened
	- If exchange telephonic, send seller's solicitor the signed contract and deposit cheque in accordance with the undertaking given, after checking the contract is dated and contains the agreed completion date.
	- Protect the contract by registration, where appropriate.

## Registration of Contract

In practice, registration is uncommon since completion often takes place shortly after exchange But should be registered if:

- There is a long delay (>2 months) before exchange and completion
- Reason to doubt the seller's good faith
- Dispute between seller and buyer
- Seller delays completion beyond the contractual date.

Registered land: protect by entry of a notice on the register of title.

## Buyer in Possession

### Buyer's Occupation Before Completion

Seller entitled to retain possession until completion, unless otherwise agreed. Buyer's request to enter and occupy the premises before completion should be regarded with caution (loss of incentive to complete on time, hard to regain possession of property if required).

If the buyer is allowed to possess before completion, ensure the buyer's occupation is as licensee and not a tenant, to avoid security of tenure issues.

SCPCs contain no provisions allowing a buyer to take possession prior to completion, nor any provisions regulating such occupation.

## Tenanted Property

- SCPC 5.2.6: seller not to give or formally withhold any licence or approve under the lease without the buyer's consent.
- SCPC 6.1.5: neither party is to agree a new rent figure unless the other agrees.

## Death of a Contracting Party

Death of one of the contracting parties between contract and completion does not affect the validity of the contract. Benefit and burden of the contract pass to the deceased's personal representatives, who are bound to complete.

If completion does not take place by the contractual completion date, there is a breach of contract. If time was not originally of the essence, may be made so by service of a notice to complete addressed to the deceased and executors named in the seller's will. A copy of the notice must be sent to the Public Trustee.

### Death of Co-seller

- Property owned by beneficial co-owners is held on a trust of land.
- If following death there remain $\geq 2$ trustees of the legal estate, the transaction can proceed to completion.
- Else, (for a beneficial joint tenancy) appoint another trustee, so there are at least 2.

### Death of Buyer

Personal representatives of the deceased bound to complete the contract. Delay in completion may occur:

- Transfer deed will need redrafting
- PRs cannot complete until they have obtained a grant of representation
- Mortgage offer usually revoked.
- Survivor of joint buyers can be forced to complete.

## Pre-completion Steps

1. Preparation of the transfer deed
2. Redemption of seller's mortgage and creation of buyer's mortgage
3. Pre-completion searches by the buyer
4. Ensuring financial aspects in order.

Conventionally 4 weeks between exchange and completion, but 2 weeks or less not uncommon. Sometimes exchange and completion are simultaneous.

# Request for Completion Information

After exchange, the buyer's solicitor requests completion information from the seller's solicitor (“requisitions on title”). Note that although historically, title was deduced at this stage, evidence of title is now almost always supplied to the buyer before exchange. The contract usually contains a clause excluding the buyer's right to raise requisitions once contracts have been exchanged (SCPC 7.2.1). If after exchange an undisclosed incumbrance/ defect is discovered by the buyer's solicitor, they will be able to require it to be remedied/ assert remedies.

- SCPC 7.2.2: buyer must raise any further title requisitions within 6 working days of a matter coming to her attention
- SCPC 7.3.1: seller's solicitor must reply to requisitions 4 working days after receiving them from buyer's solicitor.

## Standard Form Requests

Law stationers produce a standard form including common questions. Add more to the bottom. Send 2 copies to seller's solicitor, who will return one copy with their answers.

## Discharge of Seller's Existing Mortgage

Use TA13 Completion Information and Undertakings. Form contains a request for confirmation that existing mortgages will be discharged on completion. The answer to the question takes effect as an undertaking to discharge mortgages referred to.

# Transfer Deed

## Preparation

- Usually the buyer's duty to prepare
	- Transfer prepared shortly after exchange and sent to seller for approval with buyer's Request for Completion Information
	- Draft transfer be sent $\geq 12$ working days before completion date (SCPC 7.3.2)
- Seller may reserve the right by contractual condition to prepare the transfer himself (s 48(1) LPA 1925).

SCPC: seller's solicitor must submit the draft transfer to seller's solicitor when they approve the draft contract, which may be well before exchange of contracts.

## Form of Transfer

Transfer must be a deed to effect transfer of the legal estate to the buyer (s 52 LPA 1925). Must reflect the terms of the contract.

### Registered Land

Prescribed form of wording must be used. Standard Land Registry forms are usually used. A traditional conveyance cannot be used.

## Agreeing the Transfer

Buyer's solicitor must have access to:

1. The contract
2. Official copy entries
3. Precedent on which to base the transfer under preparation.

Once the draft has been prepared, 2 copies should be sent to the seller's solicitor for their approval. Amendments should be restricted to those necessary for the fulfilment of the document's legal purpose. Must be returned 4 working days after delivery to the buyer's solicitor (SCPC 7.3.2).  

When amendments have been finalised, the buyer's solicitor should prepare an engrossment (clean copy) of the transfer. Seller to execute (sign). If the buyer also needs to execute, this is commonly done before sending to the seller's solicitor.

SCPC 6.3.2: buyer must deliver engrossment of the transfer to the seller at least 5 working days before completion.

## Execution and Delivery

A valid deed must (s 1 LP(MP)A 1989):

1. Indicate clearly that it is a deed
2. Be signed by the necessary parties in the presence of a witness; and
3. Be delivered.

Signature of the seller is required to transfer the legal estate (s 52 LPA 1925). Buyer required to execute if the transfer contains a covenant/ declaration on his behalf (e.g., indemnity covenant in respect of existing covenants, or a declaration by buyers relating to trusts on which they hold the property). If there is another party (e.g., lender to release a mortgage), they should also sign.

Deed must be delivered: parties must be intended to be bound by it. This takes effect on delivery. Common for the buyer to deliver the transfer to the seller “in escrow” (conditionally) so the operation of the transfer is postponed until completion.

> [!action]
> The letter accompanying the transfer should explain to the client: 
> - Contents and puropse
> - Clear instructions relating to execution of the transfer
> - When to return by
> - Ask client not to date the transfer

## Other

### Plans

If the contract provides for the use of a plan, the transfer will also refer to the plan. Not normally considered necessary for the sale of the whole of a seller's property.

### Transfer of Whole

A transfer of the whole of a registered title will follow TR1.

# Pre-completion Searches

## Bankruptcy Searches

### Against buyer/ Borrower

Lender will require a clear bankruptcy search against the name of the buyer/ borrower before releasing mortgage funds. Unless a full search of the register has been made on Form K15, the lender's solicitor should submit Form K16 electronically to Land Registry, completed with full and correct names of the borrower. A search certificate will be returned. If there is an adverse entry revealed, lender's instructions must be immediately obtained.

> [!conduct]
> If the bankruptcy search reveals an adverse entry, the buyer's solicitor can certify that the entry does not relate to the borrower (relates to someone else with the same name). But this is construed as an undertaking given by the solicitor. 

Can also check Insolvency Service website, which will also reveal date of birth.

### Against the Seller

For registered land, most conveyancing solicitors do not consider a bankruptcy check on an individual seller necessary. s 86(5) LRA 2002 provides that where no notice or restriction relating to bankruptcy appears on the title, a buyer for value acting in good faith without notice of the bankruptcy petition will take good title from the bankruptcy seller. May be worth doing in a v high value transaction.

## Company Search

May be done as a pre-contract search. Update at this stage of the transaction.

## Powers of Attorney

If the transfer deed is to be executed by a person acting under the authority of an enduring or lasting power of attorney, do a search with the Office of Public Guardian to check whether or not registration of the power is effected/ pending.

| Power    | Registered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Pending                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enduring | Transaction may proceed to completion, provided the buyer has no actual knowledge of any circumstances that would revoke the power. Power no longer revocable without notification to the Public Guardian. Office copy of the power should be obtained from the Office of Public Guardian. | Do not proceed. Suggests mental incapacity of the donor. |
| Lasting  | As above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Do not proceed. Only comes into effect once registered.                                                          |

## Local Land Searches and Enquiries

Searches invariably made before exchange of contracts. Only repeat prior to completion if:

1. $> 2$ months between exchange and completion and the search is not covered/ replaced by insurance.
2. Information received by the buyer's solicitor suggests a further search may be advisable.
3. Contract conditional on the satisfactory results of later searches.

## Inspection of the Property

May be necessary just before completion.

## Results of Searches

If the searches reveal something unexpected:

- Contact the seller's solicitor immediately to find out exactly what the issue is and if it can be rectified before completion.
- For a Land Charges Department search, apply for an official copy of the entry using Form K19 (reveal name and address of the person with the benefit of the charge).
- Keep the client, lender and other solicitors involved informed.

### Removing Entry From the Register

An application form for the removal of an entry from the register in either registered or unregistered land will be accepted by the Chief Land Registrar only if it is signed by the person with the benefit of the charge or a person acting on his behalf.

An application form signed by the seller’s solicitors, or an undertaking given by them on completion to secure the removal of the charge may not, therefore, suffice, unless the seller is the person with the benefit of the charge (see Holmes v Kennard (H) and Son (A Firm) (1985) 49 P & CR 202).

### Irrelevant Land Charges Entries

Charges registered at the Land Charges Department can only validly be entered against the name of an estate owner in relation to the period in which he owned the land in question. Sometimes the system throws up irrelevant ones. Often seller's solicitor asked to certify that an entry is irrelevant (undertaking).

### Entries That Cannot Be Removed

If a seller is unwilling/ unable to remove an adverse entry revealed by a pre-completion search, check contract terms to see if seller is in breach.

### Official Certificates of Search

An official certificate of search issued by Land Registry is not conclusive in favour of the  
searcher, who will thus take his interest in the land subject to whatever entries are on the  
register, irrespective of whether or not they were revealed by the search certificate ([[Parkash v Irani Finance Ltd [1970] Ch 101]]).

## Priority Periods

An official certificate of search issued by Land Registry following a search made on Form OS1 or OS2 gives a priority period to the searcher of 30 working days from the Certificate Date in the search. The searcher will take priority over any entry made during the priority period, provided that completion takes place and a correct application for registration of the transaction is received by the appropriate Land Registry Office by 12 noon on the day when the priority period given by the search expires.

The expiry of the priority period is shown on the search certificate. Cannot be extended.

## Client Mortgage

### Seller

Seller must obtain from the seller's lender a “redemption statement” showing the exact amount to discharge the seller's mortgage. Daily rate usually included.

Lender must inform Land Registry of the discharge of mortgage: Form DS1 or electronic ED system.

### Buyer

After completing investigation of title, the solicitor acting for the buyer's lender reports to the lender that that title to the property is safe, marketable and acceptable security. City of London Law Society's form of certificate often used. Solicitor acting for buyer's lender must also make a formal request for the advance money from the lender. Mortgage deed should be prepared for signature by the borrowers.

## Apportionment

Outgoings attaching to the land can be split between parties on completion. Calculations shown on completion statement. SCPC 9.3 includes apportionment provisions. SCPC 9.3.3: buyer is deemed to own the property for the entirety of the day of completion.

## Completion Statement

Shows the money required to complete the transaction. Usually requested by the buyer when the Request for Completion Information is sent to the seller. Usually only necessary when sum due includes apportionments/ other sums in excess of the balance of purchase price ([[Carne v De Bono [1988] 3 All ER 485]]). 2 copies to be sent to the buyer.

## SDLT

SDLT return should be made to HMRC, giving details of the transaction and the buyer. Can be submitted online or by post using Form SDLT1. If by post, seller must sign. If the buyer's solicitor is also acting for a lender, a SDLT return should be completed by the solicitor and approved by the buyer before the loan is used to finance the purchase. Solicitor should check it has adequate cleared funds from the client to cover SDLT payment.

If steps are not taken and the buyer refuses to pay SDLT, it will not be possible to register the transaction at the Land Registry, so the lender will have no security for its loan (and solicitor may be liable).

## Money

Check figures sent by seller's solicitor. Think about if bridging finance or a further loan is necessary. Solicitor may be guilty of a criminal offence if they assist someone suspected of money laundering. Be wary.

## Completion Checklist

To be prepared and sent to any agents.

1. Documents to be available at completion:  
	(a) contract;  
	(b) evidence of title;  
	(c) copy transfer deed;  
	(d) replies to Request for Completion Information;  
	(e) completion statement.
2. Documents to be inspected by buyer:  
	(a) title deeds, where in unregistered land these are not to be handed over on  
	completion (e.g., on a sale of part);  
	(b) power(s) of attorney;  
	(c) grant of administration;  
	(d) receipts/demands for apportionments if not previously supplied.
3. Documents, etc, to be handed to buyer on completion:  
	(a) where the property is unregistered land, title deeds and a schedule of deeds and a  
	certified copy of any memorandum endorsed on retained deeds;  
	(b) original lease (on purchase of a lease);  
	(c) executed transfer deed;  
	(d) Form DS1/discharged mortgage or undertaking in respect of discharge of  
	mortgage(s);  
	(e) receipt for money paid for chattels;  
	(f) keys of the property (if these are not available the seller’s solicitor should be asked  
	to telephone the keyholder to request the release of the keys).
4. Documents, etc, to be handed to seller on completion:  
	(a) executed duplicate transfer deed/counterpart lease (where appropriate);  
	(b) receipted schedule of any deeds received from seller;  
	(c) release of deposit if held by third party in capacity of stakeholder.
5. Unregistered land only, endorsements on documents (if required by buyer):  
	(a) endorsement of sale on most recently dated retained document of title (sale of  
	part);  
	(b) abstract or epitome to be marked up as compared with the original deeds (in  
	respect of any document the original of which is not handed over on completion).

> [!summary]
> -   In anticipation of completion, the TR1 which will transfer the legal title from the seller to the buyer will need to be executed.  The seller will always execute this document and the buyer will also do so if the buyer is "doing something" in the TR1 such as giving an indemnity covenant or declaring a beneficial interest under a trust. 
> -   On completion, the buyer's solicitor will send the balance of the purchase price (as the seller will already have been given the deposit on exchange). 
> -   On receipt of the money, the seller's solicitor will complete the transaction by dating the TR1.  
> -   Once the TR1 has been dated, the buyer's solicitor will need to date the mortgage deed.  This cannot be done until after the TR1 has been dated, as technically, the buyer does not own the property until then and so would not be in a position to grant a mortgage over it. 
> -   The seller's solicitor will send the TR1 to the buyer's solicitor.   SDLT must then be paid, if due.  The application to register the buyer as the new registered proprietor cannot take place until this has been done. 
> -   Once SDLT, if due, has been paid, an application to Land Registry must be made to have the buyer registered as the new registered proprietor of the land in the title and to register the new mortgage.  This must be done before the expiry of the priority period of the OS1 search that should have been carried out prior to completion. 
> -   Land Registry will process the application for registration and insert buyer as the new registered proprietor and the details of the new charge.  Once this has been done, Land Registry will forward an official copy of the entries on the register, known as a Title Information Document (or TID) to the buyer's solicitor.  Although this is not strictly a document of title, it is for buyer to keep as evidence that it is the new owner. It should be checked to ensure that the transfer has been correctly carried out. 
> -   Once the TID has been checked, the solicitor acting for the buyer will need to deal with the safe custody of the TID and other papers.  Where the property has been bought with the aid of a mortgage, as here, it is usual for these papers to be lodged with the lender. 
> -   Finally, when all the above matters have been dealt with and the bill paid, it is possible to close the file.
