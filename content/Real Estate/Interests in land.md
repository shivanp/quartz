# Interests in land

## Interests

All land is owned by the Crown. The freehold and leasehold estates are proprietary rights of possession. Proprietary rights of more limited use are known as ‘**interests in land**’.

An interest in the land does not give a right to possess the land in the way an estate does, rather it gives the interest holder the right to do something on the land, or restrict what can be done on the land. As a proprietary right, an interest is a very powerful right in the land, which can be recovered (as an action ‘in rem’) and capable of enforcement against third parties i.e., new owners of the land burdened by the interest.

> Interests are proprietary rights to use/enjoy the land. Interests are also sometimes referred to as **incumbrances** on an estate.

## Distinguishing Proprietary and Personal Rights

Given the powerful nature of proprietary rights, they are seen as a burden on the land. If a piece of land is subject to a proprietary right of way (an easement) if may adversely affect the value and saleability of the land in question.

Parliament has therefore limited the number of rights that are capable of being proprietary. The number of interests is limited by [LPA 1925, s 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/1).

If a right has not been recognised by LPA 1925, s 1 as having proprietary status then it will only ever be personal in nature. An example of such a right is a licence, which is not an interest in land but rather a personal right against the grantor.

> [!statute] s 1 LPA 1925
> 
> (2) The only interests or charges in or over land which are capable of subsisting or of being conveyed or created at law are—
> 
> (a) An **easement,** right, or privilege in or over land for an interest equivalent to an estate in fee simple absolute in possession or a term of years absolute; ..
> 
> (c) A charge by way of **legal mortgage** …
> 
> (e) **Rights of entry** exercisable over or in respect of a legal term of years absolute, or annexed, for any purpose, to a legal rent charge.
> 
> (3) All other estates, interests, and charges in or over land take effect as equitable interests.

The rights under s 1(2)(a), (c) and (e) are **legal interests.** The rights under s 1(3) are those which have been recognised by courts as having proprietary status. Such interests will only take effect in equity.

The distinction between legal and equitable interests becomes important in respect of enforcement and remedies available.

## Legal Interests

### Mortgage

A mortgage can be defined as a loan of cash, which is secured by rights granted over property. These rights include the right to possess and sell the land in the event of default in the mortgage repayments. It is the borrower that grants the mortgage, not the lender.

### Easement

An easement is a proprietary right to use land which belongs to somebody else. The use is more limited than an exclusive right to occupy or use.

An easement must be granted for a term equivalent to one of the legal estates (i.e., forever, like the freehold, or for a certain period, like a lease) to be a legal easement: LPA 1925, s 1(2)(a).

> [!example]
> Rights of way, drainage, storage, and parking on neighbouring land.

### Right of Way

A right of entry is either:

- a right for a landlord to re-enter leased premises and end the leasehold estate in the event of tenant default or some other specified event occurring; or
- a rentcharge owner’s right to hold the land if money owed in not paid.

A **rentcharge** is very uncommon. It is a legal right to receive a periodic sum paid by the owner of the land.

A right of entry in a lease is also known as a ‘**forfeiture clause**’.

> [!note]
> Rights of entry are not considered other than in the context of forfeiture.

## Equitable Interests

### Restrictive Covenant

A covenant is a promise. Covenants between freehold owners generally arise when one person sells part of their land and wishes to ensure that the buyer does not do anything which could affect the amenity and value of the seller’s retained land.

Restrictive covenants are negative in nature, they prevent a landowner from doing something on their land.

A restrictive covenant is not a recognised legal interest in the land. It falls under LPA 1925, s 1 (3) as being an equitable interest and was recognised by the courts as being an interest in the land in the 1840s.

> [!example]
> Promise not to sell alcohol from the land, promise not to build on the land, promise to only use the land for residential purposes.

### Estate Contract

The estate contract is a contractual right to a legal estate, whether freehold or leasehold.

Equity will order specific performance of a contract to create or transfer a legal estate, because each piece of land is regarded as unique. This, together with the maxim that ‘equity sees that as done what ought to be done’, results in an equitable interest arising from the contract.

> [!example]
> A contract to buy land, a contract to grant a lease, an option to purchase land, a right of pre-emption.

### Interests in a Trust of Land

A trust exists where one person (the trustee) holds property for the benefit of another (the beneficiary). When a trust exists, there is a split in the legal and equitable title (ownership). A piece of land may be placed in trust. The beneficiary(s), has an equitable interest in the land.

The trustees and beneficiaries can be the same or different people.

- Trustee(s) hold the legal title
- Beneficiary(s) hold the equitable title.

#### Express Trust

A trust of land can be created expressly, see [[Creation of express trusts]]

> [!example]
> A piece of land is transferred to A to hold in trust for B. A is the trustee, the legal owner of the land. B is the beneficiary and has an equitable interest in the land.

#### Implied Trust

A trust of land can be created impliedly.

> [!example]
> A and B buy a house together, each contributing 50% of the purchase price. The land is transferred to A only. A is the legal owner of the land. Equity recognises B’s contribution and implies a trust. A and B are both beneficiaries. B has an equitable interest in the land.

## Legal Vs Equitable Interests

The distinction between legal and equitable interests is important for two main reasons in modern land law.

### Remedies

A person who holds a legal interest, whose interest is infringed, will have a wide range of remedies available to him. At law, this will include damages, which the holder of the right would get as of right i.e., automatically). There would be no discretion to take into account the merits of the case. In addition, a number of equitable remedies may be available to him, although this will be subject to satisfying the usual equitable principles.

In contrast, a person who holds an equitable interest, whose interest is infringed, is not entitled to damages as of right. The remedies granted, which may include damages or other equitable remedies, are entirely at the discretion of the court.

### Enforcement of Interest Against Third Parties

The second reason the distinction is important is enforcement of the interest against third parties. See [[Enforcing Interests (Registered Land)]] and [[Enforcing interests (unregistered land)]].
