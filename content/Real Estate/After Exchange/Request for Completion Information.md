# Request for Completion Information

After exchange, the buyer's solicitor requests completion information from the seller's solicitor (“requisitions on title”). Note that although historically, title was deduced at this stage, evidence of title is now almost always supplied to the buyer before exchange. The contract usually contains a clause excluding the buyer's right to raise requisitions once contracts have been exchanged (SCPC 7.2.1). If after exchange an undisclosed incumbrance/ defect is discovered by the buyer's solicitor, they will be able to require it to be remedied/ assert remedies.

- SCPC 7.2.2: buyer must raise any further title requisitions within 6 working days of a matter coming to her attention
- SCPC 7.3.1: seller's solicitor must reply to requisitions 4 working days after receiving them from buyer's solicitor.

## Standard Form Requests

Law stationers produce a standard form including common questions. Add more to the bottom. Send 2 copies to seller's solicitor, who will return one copy with their answers.

## Discharge of Seller's Existing Mortgage

Use TA13 Completion Information and Undertakings. Form contains a request for confirmation that existing mortgages will be discharged on completion. The answer to the question takes effect as an undertaking to discharge mortgages referred to.
