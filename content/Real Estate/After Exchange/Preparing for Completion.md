## Client Mortgage

### Seller

Seller must obtain from the seller's lender a “redemption statement” showing the exact amount to discharge the seller's mortgage. Daily rate usually included.

Lender must inform Land Registry of the discharge of mortgage: Form DS1 or electronic ED system.

### Buyer

After completing investigation of title, the solicitor acting for the buyer's lender reports to the lender that that title to the property is safe, marketable and acceptable security. City of London Law Society's form of certificate often used. Solicitor acting for buyer's lender must also make a formal request for the advance money from the lender. Mortgage deed should be prepared for signature by the borrowers.

## Apportionment

Outgoings attaching to the land can be split between parties on completion. Calculations shown on completion statement. SCPC 9.3 includes apportionment provisions. SCPC 9.3.3: buyer is deemed to own the property for the entirety of the day of completion.

## Completion Statement

Shows the money required to complete the transaction. Usually requested by the buyer when the Request for Completion Information is sent to the seller. Usually only necessary when sum due includes apportionments/ other sums in excess of the balance of purchase price ([[Carne v De Bono [1988] 3 All ER 485]]). 2 copies to be sent to the buyer.

## SDLT

SDLT return should be made to HMRC, giving details of the transaction and the buyer. Can be submitted online or by post using Form SDLT1. If by post, seller must sign. If the buyer's solicitor is also acting for a lender, a SDLT return should be completed by the solicitor and approved by the buyer before the loan is used to finance the purchase. Solicitor should check it has adequate cleared funds from the client to cover SDLT payment.

If steps are not taken and the buyer refuses to pay SDLT, it will not be possible to register the transaction at the Land Registry, so the lender will have no security for its loan (and solicitor may be liable).

## Money

Check figures sent by seller's solicitor. Think about if bridging finance or a further loan is necessary. Solicitor may be guilty of a criminal offence if they assist someone suspected of money laundering. Be wary.

```ad-summary
-   In anticipation of completion, the TR1 which will transfer the legal title from the seller to the buyer will need to be executed.  The seller will always execute this document and the buyer will also do so if the buyer is "doing something" in the TR1 such as giving an indemnity covenant or declaring a beneficial interest under a trust. 
-   On completion, the buyer's solicitor will send the balance of the purchase price (as the seller will already have been given the deposit on exchange). 
-   On receipt of the money, the seller's solicitor will complete the transaction by dating the TR1.  
-   Once the TR1 has been dated, the buyer's solicitor will need to date the mortgage deed.  This cannot be done until after the TR1 has been dated, as technically, the buyer does not own the property until then and so would not be in a position to grant a mortgage over it. 
-   The seller's solicitor will send the TR1 to the buyer's solicitor.   SDLT must then be paid, if due.  The application to register the buyer as the new registered proprietor cannot take place until this has been done. 
-   Once SDLT, if due, has been paid, an application to Land Registry must be made to have the buyer registered as the new registered proprietor of the land in the title and to register the new mortgage.  This must be done before the expiry of the priority period of the OS1 search that should have been carried out prior to completion. 
-   Land Registry will process the application for registration and insert buyer as the new registered proprietor and the details of the new charge.  Once this has been done, Land Registry will forward an official copy of the entries on the register, known as a Title Information Document (or TID) to the buyer's solicitor.  Although this is not strictly a document of title, it is for buyer to keep as evidence that it is the new owner. It should be checked to ensure that the transfer has been correctly carried out. 
-   Once the TID has been checked, the solicitor acting for the buyer will need to deal with the safe custody of the TID and other papers.  Where the property has been bought with the aid of a mortgage, as here, it is usual for these papers to be lodged with the lender. 
-   Finally, when all the above matters have been dealt with and the bill paid, it is possible to close the file.
