# Transfer Deed

## Preparation

- Usually the buyer's duty to prepare
	- Transfer prepared shortly after exchange and sent to seller for approval with buyer's Request for Completion Information
	- Draft transfer be sent $\geq 12$ working days before completion date (SCPC 7.3.2)
- Seller may reserve the right by contractual condition to prepare the transfer himself (s 48(1) LPA 1925).

SCPC: seller's solicitor must submit the draft transfer to seller's solicitor when they approve the draft contract, which may be well before exchange of contracts.

## Form of Transfer

Transfer must be a deed to effect transfer of the legal estate to the buyer (s 52 LPA 1925). Must reflect the terms of the contract.

### Registered Land

Prescribed form of wording must be used. Standard Land Registry forms are usually used. A traditional conveyance cannot be used.

## Agreeing the Transfer

Buyer's solicitor must have access to:

1. The contract
2. Official copy entries
3. Precedent on which to base the transfer under preparation.

Once the draft has been prepared, 2 copies should be sent to the seller's solicitor for their approval. Amendments should be restricted to those necessary for the fulfilment of the document's legal purpose. Must be returned 4 working days after delivery to the buyer's solicitor (SCPC 7.3.2).  

When amendments have been finalised, the buyer's solicitor should prepare an engrossment (clean copy) of the transfer. Seller to execute (sign). If the buyer also needs to execute, this is commonly done before sending to the seller's solicitor.

SCPC 6.3.2: buyer must deliver engrossment of the transfer to the seller at least 5 working days before completion.

## Execution and Delivery

A valid deed must (s 1 LP(MP)A 1989):

1. Indicate clearly that it is a deed
2. Be signed by the necessary parties in the presence of a witness; and
3. Be delivered.

Signature of the seller is required to transfer the legal estate (s 52 LPA 1925). Buyer required to execute if the transfer contains a covenant/ declaration on his behalf (e.g., indemnity covenant in respect of existing covenants, or a declaration by buyers relating to trusts on which they hold the property). If there is another party (e.g., lender to release a mortgage), they should also sign.

Deed must be delivered: parties must be intended to be bound by it. This takes effect on delivery. Common for the buyer to deliver the transfer to the seller “in escrow” (conditionally) so the operation of the transfer is postponed until completion.

```ad-action
The letter accompanying the transfer should explain to the client: 
- Contents and puropse
- Clear instructions relating to execution of the transfer
- When to return by
- Ask client not to date the transfer
```

## Other

### Plans

If the contract provides for the use of a plan, the transfer will also refer to the plan. Not normally considered necessary for the sale of the whole of a seller's property.

### Transfer of Whole

A transfer of the whole of a registered title will follow TR1.
