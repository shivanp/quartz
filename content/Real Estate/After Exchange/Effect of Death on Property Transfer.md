# Effect of Death on Property Transfer

See [Practical Law note](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I4bc10098ead111e398db8b09b4f043e0/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad7401200000182304c176303403b3e%3Fppcid%3D92c9e27ba81f46dc9301f1fab99b0c41%26Nav%3DKNOWHOW_UK%26fragmentIdentifier%3DI4bc10098ead111e398db8b09b4f043e0%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=2967b7bb43f5d2398c4b22e06cec317b&list=KNOWHOW_UK&rank=1&sessionScopeId=0070cd68dcf334e42105aa39c8f99dcf33d9d3386b1fbe8a3314900d842b6028&ppcid=92c9e27ba81f46dc9301f1fab99b0c41&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=(sc.Search)&comp=pluk)

## Co-ownership

Important to ascertain beneficial interests, so that these can be overreached on completion of the purchase.

> "No disposition by a sole proprietor of the registered estate (except a trust corporation) under which capital money arises is to be registered unless authorised by an order of the court."

A restriction in Form A of the proprietorship register warns a buyer that the beneficial interest is held by tenants in common. This is automatically placed by the Land Registry, unless it is clear there is a beneficial joint tenant ownership.

Remember that a joint tenancy can be severed and converted to a tenancy in common, and it is the responsibility of the interested party to apply for an entry of the restriction.

```ad-action
Buyer should make their own enquiries too, since Form A is not conclusive. 
```

## Overreaching

```ad-defn
Overreaching is the process of transferring the beneficial interests under a trust from the land itself to the capital money received from the purchaser of the legal estate.
```

The interests of the beneficiaries under the trust will be overreached only if the trustees convey the legal estate to a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration and give a receipt for any capital money (_sections 2(1) and 205(1)(xxi), LPA 1925_). 'Trustees' means at least two trustees/ a trust corporation.

## Death of Beneficial Joint Tenant

### Surviving Joint Tenants

The right of survivorship means that upon the death of one co-owner, that co-owner's interest in the property will pass automatically to the surviving co-owners by law, irrespective of any will.

### Sale by Sole Surviving Tenant

If the seller is the sole surviving joint tenant, the trust will have come to an end on the death of the other joint tenant. The sole surviving joint tenant is legally and beneficially entitled to the whole of the property. There is no need to appoint a second trustee.

### Where Deceased Left No Surviving Joint Tenants

If the deceased was the sole surviving joint tenant, the trust will have come to an end on the death of the other joint tenant. The legal estate vests in the deceased's PRs, who can deal with the property in accordance with the deceased's will/ intestacy.

## Death of Beneficial TIC

### Deceased's Beneficial Interest

| Estate     | What happens                                                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legal      | Must be held as joint tenants, so passes under survivorship to the surviving co-owners. |
| Beneficial | Share of beneficial interest passes to estate, to be dealt with by PRs.                                                                                         |

The PRs of the deceased have the power to transfer the equitable interest to those entitled using an assent. An assent of an equitable interest (unlike a legal interest) does not trigger compulsory first registration.

### Deceased's BI Passing to Surviving Owner

If the deceased's beneficial interest passes to the surviving owner under the deceased's will, the trust will come to an end. As the trust has ended and the surviving owner is the sole beneficial owner, they can apply to the Land Registry for the Form A restriction to be cancelled. This must be accompanied by evidence of the survivor's sole beneficial entitlement to the whole of the estate, such as a statutory declaration or statement of truth by the sole survivor confirming that they are solely entitled.

### Deceased's BI Passing to 3rd Party

### Trust Registration Service (TRS)

Where the deceased's beneficial interest passes to a third party (not the surviving owner), the sole surviving legal owner (as trustee of the beneficial interest) may need to register the trust with HMRC's Trust Registration Service (TRS).

### Appointing 2nd Trustee

If the trust is continuing and the property is to be sold, the appointment of a second trustee of the legal title, and the joining of the second trustee in the transfer, is needed to overreach the deceased's equitable interest.

```ad-warning
It is not sufficient for the deceased's PRs to act with the surviving legal owner. This is because only the deceased's beneficial interest passes to the PRs in death. A second trustee of the **legal** title is required.
```

The second trustee need not be a party to the contract for sale since the survivor, as sole legal owner by survivorship, is able to enter into a property sale contract alone. However, the second trustee must be a party to the transfer, and be a joint recipient of the sale proceeds.

Unless the sole trustee is a trust corporation, at least 2 trustees are needed.

#### Practical

In practice, the second trustee is usually appointed in the transfer on sale. The transfer will attract a Land Registry fee for the transfer into the joint names of the survivor and the second trustee, then a second fee for the transfer into the name of the purchaser.

### $>1$ Surviving TIC

If there is more than one surviving tenant in common, there are sufficient survivors to overreach the deceased's equitable interest on a sale of the property, so there is no need to appoint an additional trustee as a matter of law.

Maybe appoint PRs as additional trustees if there is potential for dispute between surviving TICs.

All of the registered proprietors on the legal title should be party to the transfer.

#### Proceeds of Sale

Following the sale, the surviving owners (and additional trustee(s) if applicable) hold the sale proceeds on trust for themselves in respect of their share, and the deceased's PRs in respect of the deceased's share.

If the trustees do not pass on the net sale proceeds, PRs could:

1. Apply to court under s 14 TLATA 1996
2. Claim for breach of trust.

### No Surviving TICs

If the last TIC has appointed a single PR, a second trustee would need to be appointed to act with the sole proving PR to overreach the beneficial interests and receive the proceeds of sale. A second trustee will be required to satisfy a Form A restriction.

#### Sole PR & Beneficiary

Can a sole PR who is also the sole beneficiary assent the property to themselves without a second trustee?

As the property is not being sold, there is no need to have two trustees to give a good receipt for the proceeds of sale. When an assent of an equitable interest results in the beneficiary being absolutely entitled to the property, the trust of land has ended and the Form A restriction on the register may be removed.
