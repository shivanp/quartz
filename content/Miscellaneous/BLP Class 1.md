16 workshops, all examinable. Look at the outcomes for each workshop.

Partnership agreement doesn't have to be written, but this is common sense.

Approach to a partnership agreement:

- Is there a partnership
- Does PA 1890 say anything
- Can it be varied by a contrary agreement?
- If so, has it been varies?
- What are the terms/ duties of the partnership?
- Interpret and apply relevant provisions of Partnership Act or agreement
- Advise appropriately.
