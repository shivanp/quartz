# DR Class 1

5 stages of litigation:

1. Pre-commencement
2. Commencement of action
3. Interim matters
4. Trial
5. Post-trial.

Tend to get this sequence in the exam. 20/09/22 â€“ 3hr15 assessment.

Organise notes thematically, not by lecture. Broadly follows the workshops.

4 written questions: 3 civil, 1 criminal. There's also an advocacy assessment with role play as a barrister (tutor is judge).
