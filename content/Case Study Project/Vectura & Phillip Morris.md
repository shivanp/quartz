# Vectura & Phillip Morris

Phillip Morris International's takeover of UK-based Vectura Group PLC has raised a number of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) issues. The tobacco giant is the world's largest cigarette manufacturer and has long faced criticism for its environmental impacts, including contributing to deforestation and land degradation. Additionally, the company has faced its fair share of social controversies, from its marketing of cigarettes to its alleged exploitation of workers in developing countries. Finally, the company's corporate governance has come under scrutiny in the past, with its board of directors being accused of inadequate oversight and lack of transparency. As a result, any takeover of Vectura Group could bring these issues to the forefront and potentially create a reputational risk for the new owner.
