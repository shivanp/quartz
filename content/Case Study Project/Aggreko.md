# Aggreko

The takeover of Aggreko by I Squared Capital and TDR Capital was announced in August 2019. Aggreko is a global provider of temporary power and temperature control solutions. The company's services include rental of power generation equipment, temperature control equipment, and oil-free compressed air systems, as well as the provision of energy solutions and management services. The company operates in more than 100 countries and serves a variety of customers including utilities, industrial and commercial businesses, and governments.  

I Squared Capital, a global infrastructure investment firm, and TDR Capital, a European-focused private equity firm, formed a consortium to purchase Aggreko, with I Squared Capital taking a majority stake in the company. The deal was valued at £2.3 billion. The deal was completed in January 2020.  

The acquisition by I Squared Capital and TDR Capital was aimed to provide Aggreko with the resources and strategic support to expand its global presence and to benefit from the growing demand for temporary power and temperature control solutions, especially in the developing markets. The private equity firms believed that Aggreko's differentiated business model, its strong brand, and its global scale and reach, would be able to capitalize on the growing demand for temporary power and temperature control solutions.

15 ESG & Sustainability Report 2021/22 16  
Aggreko is working alongside customers to provide tailored  
solutions, at different stages of the energy transition, driven by a  
commitment to create better energy solutions to secure a more  
sustainable future. This includes end-to-end solutions to accelerate  
the deployment of affordable and cleaner energy, as well as  
sustainable infrastructure.  
Aggreko is supporting the Salares Norte Mine, an open-pit  
gold mine in northern Chile, in meeting the challenges of  
supplying consistent power to an off-grid project. In addition to  
physical challenges, the Chilean government applies stringent  
environmental regulations to such projects, and gold fields require  
a minimum 20% renewable power generation for all mining  
operations. The PV solution, designed by Aggreko, will be tailor-  
made to meet the project’s needs and will lead to an estimated  
saving of $700,000 per year in energy costs and a further $1.1m  
in carbon tax offset over the project’s lifetime. It is estimated to  
offset 104,000 tonnes of carbon emissions. The hybrid solution will  
allow the site to run completely off-grid, delivering sustainable and  
reliable power 24 hours a day.

“The drive for businesses, governments and  
individuals to transition to a greener, cleaner  
world is accelerating. The energy crisis  
is reaching all corners of the globe and  
is increasing the demand for alternative  
energy solutions. Aggreko is guiding our  
customers through this energy transition,  
partnering with them to provide sustainable,  
resilient energy solutions.”

## **Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation**

Disclosures required under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector dated 27 November 2019, as amended (“SFDR”).

### **Introduction**

TDR Capital LLP in its capacity as investment manager of the various TDR managed funds (“TDR”) is committed to acting as a responsible business, employer and investor. This includes disclosing our approach to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) considerations publicly. This statement sets out the disclosures required under SFDR.

### **No Consideration of Adverse Sustainability Impacts (Article 4(1)(b))**

TDR considers ESG factors in its investment process. We consider that our existing ESG Policy (and the ESG Principles in that document) is appropriate, proportional and tailored to the investment strategies of our investment funds. As a result, we do not consider adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors as specifically set out in SFDR. We continue to monitor regulatory developments with respect to the SFDR and other applicable ESG-focused laws and regulations, including the implementation of related and secondary legislation and regulatory guidance, and will, where required or otherwise appropriate, make changes to our existing policies and procedures.

### **Our Sustainability Risk Policies (Article 3(1))**

In line with TDR’s ESG Policy and the ESG Principles in the ESG Policy, TDR seeks to integrate ESG considerations into each phase of its investment activities, from origination efforts, through due diligence, completion and then during its ownership period to exit. Additional information with respect to these phases is set out below.

Due diligence**:** Prior to making an investment TDR will seek to undertake a due diligence process designed, inter alia, at identifying material ESG-related risks and opportunities associated with a potential investment opportunity and include these in the plan for due diligence. Risks and opportunities that are identified will generally be discussed with advisors and management and, where appropriate, TDR will engage external ESG specialists to investigate specific areas of risk or opportunities related to a potential portfolio company. Significant ESG risks identified during due diligence are normally raised and discussed with TDR’s investment committee prior to an investment decision being made.

Prior to Closing: An ESG report summarising the material ESG factors affecting the target business (including any which may need immediate attention) is normally prepared by the relevant TDR team, and presented to TDR’s Investment Committee, who will consider the report as part of the transaction review prior to an Investment Committee decision being made.

During our ownership period**:** During our ownership period TDR deal teams will work with the management teams to agree ESG priorities, how performance on material ESG factors will be measured and tracked on an ongoing basis. Based on an agreed approach, periodic ESG reports at the level of each portfolio company are prepared and reviewed by TDR’s Responsible Investment Committee with feedback provided to TDR partners and the deal team regarding any concerns or further opportunities. In addition, portfolio companies are expected to report on certain key performance indicators (KPIs) on an annual basis, with some on a quarterly basis where information is readily identified.

Exit: TDR’s ESG monitoring and processes put in place during ownership are designed to assist the portfolio companies in their own separate development of sustainability practices in respect of each of its investments. As part of the preparation for an exit, TDR will normally prepare a summary of the status of material ESG factors for inclusion in vendor due diligence. After exit, TDR will usually seek to identity the value delivered by the ESG initiatives which took place during the period of its ownership.

The identification and assessments of specific risks, including ESG risks, take place on an investment-by-investment basis in accordance with the above process. As a result of following this process, TDR seeks to ensure that identified ESG risks are managed in an effective responsible manner, although there can be no guarantee that the process will successfully identify and mitigate all material risks.

### **TDR’s Remuneration Policies in Relation to the Integration of Sustainability Risks (Article 5(1))**

TDR has adopted a Remuneration Policy that reflects the applicable requirements of the FCA’s Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls Sourcebook. As required by the FCA’s requirements, we believe our Remuneration Policy is consistent with and promotes sound and effective risk management, which we consider to include the management of sustainability risks in our investments. Staff performance is assessed based on a range of financial and non-financial criteria, including adherence to our due diligence procedures that are designed to identify and mitigate the risks inherent in each of our investments, including (as noted above) sustainability and other ESG-related risks identified and managed pursuant to our ESG Policy.

This statement is made in accordance with SFDR and constitutes TDR Capital LLP’s required ESG disclosures as at 6 September 2022. It has been approved by the Management Committee of TDR Capital LLP.

As a private company, we are not subject to mandatory TCFD reporting, however, given the close links to our net-zero targets and Group strategy, and our commitment to developing our reporting in this area, we have produced the below voluntary disclosure.

Our sustainability priorities are built into our business and well embedded within internal governance frameworks, leading to clearly defined oversight and reporting at the Operational Board.

The results show that 99% of GHG emissions arise from the operation of our fleet  
when it is out on rent. There are three main factors driving our annual GHG emissions:  
the fuel type our customers use; the pattern of their usage; and the fuel efficiency of  
the fleet.

Greenhouse gas CA 2006

The Carbon Trust Standard recognises organisations that follow best practice in measuring, managing and reducing their environmental impact, achieving year-on-year reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The Northern Europe business and our manufacturing facility in Dumbarton have maintained certification to ISO 50001. These standards set out and validate a best practice approach to energy management, helping us to set a framework to continually improve our energy performance. As part of this work, the Northern Europe business changed its electricity supplier for its service centres to a supplier offering 100% renewable electricity.

They're obviously reporting a lot less now they're private. But I guess this is a non-point.

Commenting on the Announcement, Adil Rahmathulla of I Squared Capital, said:  
"Aggreko is a global market leader in delivering bespoke temporary power solutions to its customers and has clearly shown it has a strategy to complete its journey towards a net-zero emission business. The urgency to deliver on that transition has only increased in the post-Covid environment. Repositioning Aggreko fast enough to truly capitalise on these trends and rapidly shifting customer demand requires significant investment in clean technology and a step change in the pace of transformation. We are well positioned to accelerate Aggreko's development at this critical juncture and secure a successful future for the company, underpinned by a long-term investment focus and the combined expertise of TDR Capital and I Squared Capital in the power infrastructure and equipment rental sectors."

Among the reasons for recommending the offer, the board of Aggreko cited the COVID-19 pandemic as having had an impact on Aggreko's business, in particular in sectors such as events and oil and gas, which have been impacted by government responses to the pandemic.
