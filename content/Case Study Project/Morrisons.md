**Details given of plans for workforce/location of target's business**

Bidco confirmed that the existing contractual and statutory employment rights, including pension rights, of all Morrisons' management and employees will be fully safeguarded.  

  

Bidco stated that its plan for Morrisons do not involve any change in the balance of skills and functions of employees or their conditions of employment. In particular, Bidco is fully supportive of **Morrisons' recent pay award of at least £10 an hour for all Morrisons colleagues in stores and manufacturing sites**. Bidco views this pay as an important and appropriate recognition of their contributions to Morrisons.  

  

Bidco stated that it does not intend, as a result of the CD&R offer, that there will be any material change to Morrisons' headcount. If, as anticipated, following the CD&R offer becoming effective, Morrisons becomes a private limited company, a limited number of functions related to being a publicly listed company may be reduced in scope or become unnecessary. Bidco has not yet developed proposals as to how any such potential change in functions will be implemented. Bidco and CD&R, with the support and guidance of Morrisons' management, intend to provide alternative opportunities where possible within Morrisons to employees currently in these roles. At this stage, Bidco and CD&R have not yet developed a proposal in relation to these alternative opportunities or additional recruitment areas and will only develop and implement such a proposal in coordination with Morrisons' management. Bidco and CD&R will consult as necessary or appropriate with relevant employees, any employee representatives and other stakeholders before any proposals are finalised.  

  

Bidco stated that it intends to engage with the Morrisons management team following the CD&R offer becoming effective to understand the business in more detail and to partner with management to set out the joint vision and strategy for Morrisons in the context of becoming a private company. **Bidco will ask the management of Morrisons to lead this process with the close collaboration and input of CD&R** and, where appropriate, other stakeholders in the business. Bidco stated that it believes that this review process is an important part of the long-term partnership that it intends to build with the management of Morrisons and broader stakeholders in the business in order to determine the short and long term objectives for the business and how they can best be delivered in a collaborative way. Bidco confirmed that it will work with the management of Morrisons to determine the detailed scope of this review and the appropriate timetable for its completion but Bidco anticipates this review will be completed within approximately six months from the effective date.  

  

Bidco anticipates the review will focus on all aspects of the business and opportunities available, including:  
(1) Reviewing Morrisons' markets, customers, procurement, service offerings and delivery.  
(2) Driving further investment to support customer experience and proposition, the work environment and opportunities for colleagues and Morrisons' growth ambitions and delivery of its potential.  
(3) Assessing the opportunity across each aspect of the business to enhance its strategic positioning, accelerate development and deliver its long term objectives, including potential partnerships and acquisitions. This would include Morrisons' property portfolio, portfolio of fuel forecourts and convenience retail network.  
(4) Deepening engagement with the key stakeholders of the business including customer, colleagues, suppliers and farmers, broader business partners, pension trustees and other stakeholders.  

  

The outcome of the review could include investment in people, capabilities, organisation, infrastructure and assets to grow the business sustainably over the long-term.  

  

Bidco stated that it **intends for Morrisons to continue to operate as a standalone business, led by Morrisons management team with its head office and head office functions in Bradford.** Bidco confirmed that it has no plans to make any material restructurings or change in the locations of Morrisons' places of business other than any changes at the head office, which are necessary due to Morrisons' change of status to a private limited company.  

  

Bidco confirmed that it has no plans to change the locations of Morrisons' places of business or to redeploy the fixed assets of Morrisons following the CD&R offer becoming effective.  

  

Morrisons does not currently have a research and development function and Bidco has no plans in this regard.

Morrisons has attracted interest from multiple US private equity bidders. Fortress Investment Group announced a firm offer for Morrisons in early July, having agreed to partner with CPPIB and Koch Industries as co-investors, and potential competing bids were announced from each of Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Apollo Global Management, with CD&R subsequently announcing its recommended firm offer on 19 August 2021. Apollo joined the increasing number of PE bidders that are electing to partner on bids for targets or make consortium bids, rather than potentially losing out in a competitive bidding process, announcing it was in discussions with Fortress to form part of the investment group led by Fortress on its offer. CD&R was joined by Ares European Direct Lending and Alternative Credit Funds and West Street Strategic Solutions as co-investors on its bid for Morrisons. US private equity firms were particularly active in the UK public markets in the first half of 2021 with nine of the bids backed by PE firms having been announced by US PE bidders. By contrast, in the whole of 2020, there were seven bids by US PE bidders. This trend looked set to continue.  

  

The Panel was involved in discussions to establish an auction procedure to resolve a competitive situation in a number of competing bid situations in the second half of the year (see also the competing bids for Augean and the competing bids for Vectura). Rather than using the five day auction procedure set out in Appendix 8 of the Takeover Code, the parties and the Panel agreed an alternative, single day auction procedure with up to five rounds of bidding to resolve the competitive situation in relation to Morrisons, which took place on Saturday 2 October 2021. In the final round, in order to avoid bids being made at the same price, Fortress’ bid was required to be at an even number of pence and CD&R’s bid had to be at an odd number of pence.

Reasons for offer:

- Strong heritage
- Strategy and management
	- Fix, Rebuild, Grow and Sustain plan
- Differentiated operational strengths
	- Freehold property
	- Vertical integration
	- **CD&R recognises and supports the importance of the integrated model and has recent relevant experience partnering with operators of large real estate portfolios in the UK**
- Online business

# Environmental, Social, and Governance Policy

This Environmental, Social, and Governance Policy (the “Policy”) of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R” or the “Firm”) reflects the Firm’s view that addressing environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) considerations is an important part of investing and building better businesses.

The Firm believes that sound ESG practices help businesses deliver value, not only to investors, customers, and suppliers, but also to employees and communities. In addition, the Firm believes that furthering an effective ESG strategy is essential for building strong brands and safeguarding reputation, which in turn are vital for long-term success.

The Policy outlines CD&R’s approach to integrating ESG in our decision-making across the life cycle of our investments and commercial activities.

CD&R is committed to ensuring that ESG concerns and opportunities are identified and addressed appropriately in its business and to taking steps to manage actively the impact of its activities as a fund adviser in the countries in which it operates. The Firm also encourages its portfolio companies to assess and manage the ESG impacts of their business operations.

**Investing Responsibly**

CD&R seeks to pursue the following:

1. **Consider ESG issues** during the due diligence stage for target portfolio companies;
	
2. **Work with management teams of portfolio companies** to grow and improve their businesses, including addressing environmental, public health, safety, and social issues, with the goal of enhancing long-term sustainability and performance and minimizing adverse impacts arising from these areas;
	
3. **Assess and monitor environmental impacts**, as well as climate-related risks and opportunities, and seek to reduce or mitigate environmental impacts of our activities and those of our portfolio companies;
	
4. **Advance diversity, equity, and inclusion** in both our own teams and those of our portfolio companies, including efforts to increase diversity among portfolio company boards of directors;
	
5. **Respect the human rights** of those affected by our funds’ investment activities and seek to confirm that their investments do not flow to companies that utilize child, forced, compulsory, or coerced labor; deprive individuals of their personal freedoms; engage in human trafficking; or maintain discriminatory practices;
	
6. **Ensure that portfolio company managers are able to maintain appropriate levels of oversight** in the areas of audit, risk management, and potential conflicts of interest;
	
7. **Remain committed to compliance with applicable national, state, and local labor laws** in the countries in which our funds invest; support the payment of competitive wages and benefits to employees; provide a safe and healthy workplace in conformance with national and local laws; and, consistent with applicable laws, respect the rights of employees to decide whether to join a union and engage in collective bargaining; and
	
8. **Maintain strict policies that prohibit bribery and other improper payments** consistent with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, and similar laws in other countries.

There may be certain exceptional cases in which CD&R does not pursue all of the above goals.

**Engaging with Stakeholders**

The Policy is informed by the American Investment Council’s [Guidelines for Responsible Investing](https://www.investmentcouncil.org/guidelines-for-responsible-investing/), the U.N. [Global Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles), and the U.N. [Principles for Responsible Investment](https://www.unpri.org/pri/what-are-the-principles-for-responsible-investment). CD&R will seek to be a constructive member of its communities and to be transparent about how it incorporates ESG considerations into its investment decisions by:

1. **Reporting periodically to limited partners** regarding actions taken to address the ESG issues outlined in the Policy and foster transparency in portfolio companies regarding these matters;
	
2. **Seeking to be accessible to, and engage with, stakeholders** on key issues and challenges relating to the ESG issues addressed by the Policy; and
	
3. **Advancing thoughtful responsible** **investment processes** by collaborating with industry peers, standard-setting organizations, and other stakeholders.

2. **CD&R deal teams** are responsible for implementing the Policy, with the support of the ESG and the Legal and Compliance teams. CD&R provides its investment staff with specific training and resources to help them fulfill the Firm’s ESG commitments.
	
3. **The Investment Committee** oversees ESG issues that are determined by CD&R in its sole discretion to be material to making a decision to invest.
	
4. **CD&R’s ESG Initiatives Group**, a team of multi-disciplinary specialists from across the Firm both in the U.S. and Europe, helps ensure internal coordination of the ESG-related initiatives embedded across the Firm’s functional activities and industry verticals. The ESG Initiatives Group, which meets at least three times annually, is chaired by an Operating Partner and includes investment partners, the Human Capital Partner, the head of external relations and public affairs, and a Principal focused on ESG matters. Members of the ESG Initiatives Group regularly report to the CEO and update the full partnership as appropriate.

The ESG Initiatives Group will communicate the Policy and any updates to the Policy to investment teams.

## Post-acquisition

<https://www.ft.com/content/92449162-b82b-46b6-97c3-a2cb2e266f0a>

Morrisons to close >10% of McColl convenience stores bought out of administration in May. The acquisition had meant to “unlock significant synergies throughout the supply chain”.

McColl’s sales will now be consolidated within Morrisons’ retail revenue, boosting its flagging market share.

Profits falling rapidly with inflation hitting

**The supermarkets could still sabotage themselves once more. Asda and Morrisons are both labouring under the weight of debts from private equity-backed takeovers that could limit their room for manoeuvre on margins and prices. Morrisons was seen by analysts as making unforced pricing errors earlier this year. And make no mistake, the supermarkets have been putting prices up — by 10.5-13 per cent, according to The Grocer magazine’s latest weekly survey.**

The incumbents have shifted their strategies. The discounters have been here a while. Everyone now has cutesy own brands and price matches on key product lines. Higher petrol margins have allowed the traditional Big Four to cross-subsidise grocery sales and minimise market share losses. The discounters face a tougher time expanding. With easy options exhausted, new stores now steal sales from the discounters’ other sites as well as from old-school operators. The problem for the legacy groups lies in a parallel with the airline industry. Ryanair and easyJet once catered to a no-frills niche. Their budget offer is now the norm around which the likes of British Airways have had to reorient, fundamentally altering their profitability and prospects. There are limits to the comparison. Consumers aren’t about to ditch branded goods for fake farm brands entirely, and most shoppers still want a bigger range than the discounters offer. Still, it’s possible Aldi and Lidl secure a status as the core of far more customers’ weekly shop, with the Big Four of old picking up the scraps. It’s unlikely the discounters will ever end up challenging Tesco in the market share stakes. It has 27 per cent, against 9-10 per cent for Aldi and 7-8 per cent for Lidl. Even Sainsbury and Asda look a stretch on 13-15 per cent. The German groups have already changed market dynamics. But the airline industry experience should caution against complacency. The era of Big Four dominance is long over.
