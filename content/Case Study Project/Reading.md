# PE-superficial-pucker

Emily Mendell, former managing director at the largest association of LPs, noted, “ESG is critical. It’s critical to returns, it’s critical to value creation, it’s critical to our planet. It is also going to be critical to the PE industry and the viability of the PE industry long-term.”

**The vast majority of private equity ESG efforts remain nascent and superficial.**

Business Roundtable, World Economic Forum, Davos: performance should be measured not only in terms of returns to shareholders, but also in how a business achieves environmental, social and governance objectives.

Pressure comes from an erosion of trust in governments, as well as the immediacy of the challenge. Smartphones etc. have produced more transparency than was possible in the past.

This shift accelerated as additional studies demonstrated a positive correlation between “high sustainability” companies and positive equity returns. [One influential paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964011), completed in 2014, looks at 90 matched pairs of companies — one “high sustainability” and one “low sustainability” company from the same space (two retailers, two energy producers, etc.). The high-sustainability companies significantly outperformed their counterparts in terms of both financial and stock market performance.

The combination of research reinforcing its value, a growing demand for sustainable products, and an expanding asset class portends good outcomes for investors, the planet, and social equity.

Our analysis shows that the majority of the PE firms reporting to PRI have a responsible investment or ESG policy. This is a move in the right direction, but represents a signaling of intention versus an assurance of progress.

PE house ESG policies contain conditional language to protect against legal action.

Second, our analysis relies on public disclosures to PRI. It may be that some general partners offer limited partners more detailed reporting on ESG than what is available publicly.

Though public companies’ sustainability information remains mostly unaudited and imperfect, reports adhere more and more to one of the major sustainability standards (either [Global Reporting Initiative](https://www.globalreporting.org/Pages/default.aspx) or [Sustainability Accounting Standards Board](https://www.sasb.org/)).

Why aren't PE firms doing much?

1. Short hold period - focus on financial performance
2. Incentives: ESG takes a longer horizon to lead to under-performance
3. Causation vs correlation: an active debate continues over whether these findings are correlated or causative. Said differently, do “high-sustainability” companies outperform because of a focus on ESG, or do they deliver great financial results because ESG is a by-product of a well-run company?
4. Majority of PE-owned companies have never been public and do not have the resources, expertise or inclination to produce sustainability reports.
5. Definition of ESG is imprecise and difficult to understand. GPs can cherry pick.  

## Impact of Financial Investors

Financial investors = the big asset managers (e.g., BlackRock). If these were to demand standards for PE sustainability reporting, things could change quickly.

These standards would help investors assess time series improvements – could start small with governance stuff (e.g., board diversity statistics).

“very few LPs have any ESG expertise. They don’t know how to stress-test for whether real ESG is happening or not. The interest is strong, but the follow-through is bumpy.” Providing education to boost LPs’ ESG expertise could compel attention and action at PE firms.

Credit ratings based on sustainability metrics. LPs might even fund a new ratings agency focused exclusively on ESG and mandate ratings for the portfolio companies of GPs with which they invest.

## Wikipedia ESG

Of the three areas of concern that ESG represented, the environmental and social had received most of the public and media attention, not least because of the growing fears concerning [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"). Moskowitz brought the spotlight onto the corporate governance aspect of responsible investment. His analysis concerned how the companies were managed, what the stockholder relationships were and how the employees were treated. He argued that improving corporate governance procedures did not damage financial performance; on the contrary it maximized productivity, ensured corporate efficiency and led to the sourcing and utilizing of superior management talents. In the early 2000s, the success of Moskowitz's list and its impact on companies' ease of recruitment and brand reputation began to challenge the historical assumptions regarding the financial effect of ESG factors.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance#cite_note-autogenerated2003-16) In 2011, [Alex Edmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Edmans "Alex Edmans"), a finance professor at Wharton, published a paper in the _Journal of Financial Economics_ showing that the "100 Best Companies to Work For" outperformed their peers in terms of stock returns by 2–3% a year over 1984–2009, and delivered earnings that systematically exceeded analyst expectations.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance#cite_note-17)

## BCG How PE Can Converge on ESG Data

<https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/private-equity-convergence-on-esg-data>

Lack of ESG data collection makes it challenging to ensure progress is being made on material ESG goals and to assess the link with financial performance.

Need to have more standardised ESG reporting. Lots of GPs and LPs have come together to try to create some sort of standard. Different frameworks have their own goals and stakeholders.

Impact of ESG progress on financial results.

While we must be cautious about extrapolating very far from the data gathered in the pilot, these findings call into question some beliefs about private equity. For example, some have raised concerns that as increased regulatory pressure and disclosure requirements affect public companies further, private equity could become a safe haven for high-polluting divestments. Yet we found that the private equity-owned companies in our sample have been generally willing to increase their quantitative GHG emissions disclosures, a [key finding for all asset owners](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/how-asset-owners-can-lead-the-net-zero-emissions-race). Additionally, we found no significant difference on average between private companies’ emissions intensity—amount of GHG emissions per dollar of annual revenue—and that of public companies when segmented by emissions scope.

Correlation vs causation is a key issue. Think about CCM or other statistical techniques and applying these.

1. Once they decide to begin tracking meaningful ESG data, private equity firms can move quickly, significantly increasing disclosure rates among their portfolio companies. 
2. Private equity firms can also make rapid progress toward improving their portfolio companies’ performance in the areas measured—potentially even faster than their public counterparts.
3. Aggregating ESG and financial data across multiple GP portfolios could establish correlations between ESG metrics and specific financial outcomes, enabling robust and powerful data-driven insights across the private sector.

## How Private Capital Can Harness ESG to Generate Alpha

In his keynote, Christian Sinding, CEO and Managing Partner of private equity group EQT Partners, provided a powerful perspective on this. Sinding argued that PE firms have the robust systems of governance, the resources, the time, and the optimal business model needed to make a positive impact.

He believes integrating sustainability into the strategy and operations of portfolio companies may represent the biggest value-generation opportunity in a lifetime—one that will enable PE-owned companies to future proof their businesses while making a positive impact on society.

### How Net-zero Can Boost Economic Growth

<https://www.refinitiv.com/perspectives/market-insights/how-net-zero-can-boost-economic-growth/>

The regulatory framework brought by the Paris Agreement and the guidance offered by transparency initiatives such as the [TNFD](https://tnfd.global/), and the Taskforce for Nature Related Financial Disclosures, has introduced legal certainty.

It is technically possible to decarbonise all the heavy industries of cement, steel, petrochemicals and aluminium, as well as heavy-duty transport such as shipping and aviation with [less than 0.5 percent of global GDP](https://www.energy-transitions.org/publications/mission-possible/).

Strategy:

1. Research the listing rules about climate-related disclosure
2. Look at annual reports for the public companies to see how they have complied/ explained/ what ESG initiative they are currently undertaking.
3. Why is compliance attractive? What would non-compliance look like? How does this impact the work of the PE house?
4. Check PE firm report about its acquisition and why it went for the acquisition. Then consider the wider impact and financial performance - including by digging into balance sheets (ask how to do this).
