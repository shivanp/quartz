# ESG Reg Framework

- Environmental, social and governance  
- E.g. Companies Act and Listing Rules  
- Disclosure requirements  
- What are the requirements?  
- Why were the requirements there?  
- (Do the requirements still apply?)

**CSDDD:** The European Commission adopted its proposal for the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive1 on 23 February 2022. The CSDDD is an important component of the European Green Deal, 2 as well as a long promised initiative in the EU's human rights strategy,3 and will necessitate strategic and operational changes by businesses globally.

## UK Sustainability Disclosure Requirements

<https://www.esginvestor.net/sustainability-reporting-and-double-materiality/>

SDRs were designed to broaden UK sustainability reporting, which currently focuses almost exclusively on climate-related risks, to cover a much fuller range of issues. The UK has based its climate reporting regime on the recommendations of the [Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/), but SDRs go beyond this, both by requiring [double materiality](https://www.esginvestor.net/stepping-from-enterprise-value-to-double-materiality/) and by looking at other environmental impacts and risks on top of those arising from climate change.

In reporting terms, double materiality means that disclosures should both outline how sustainability issues impact companies and how companies’ activities impact sustainable development in the society and environment beyond their immediate operations.

Benjamin Maconick, ESG associate at law firm Linklaters, says SDRs will mean a more formal framework around sustainable investments. “The FCA consciously designed SDR as a labelling system. They started from the premise that there should be concrete labels and layers of regulatory disclosures. They recognised that if you want to make this useful, then you need to make the disclosures easily digestible and have a clear labelling system.”

“The reason why [EFRAG] is keen to establish a standard through the double materiality lens is because this isn’t a private initiative. EU corporates need to be accountable to civil society, not just the investors,” de Cambourg explained.

the EU has prioritised the rapid deployment of funds and of project delivery, helping to avoid pitfalls traditionally associated with large public stimulus funds.

Specifically, a firm has to include:

- Climate-related financial disclosures regarding the overall assets managed or administered by the firm in relation to its TCFD in-scope business.
- An explanation where its approach to a particular investment strategy, asset class, or product is materially different to its overall entity level approach to governance, strategy or risk management under the TCFD recommendations.
- An explanation of how the firm's strategy under the TCFD recommendations has influenced the decision-making and process by which it delegates functions, selects delegates, and relies on services, strategies or products offered or employed by third parties, including delegates (_[ESG 2.2.1R](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/ESG/2/?view=chapter)_).

_[ESG 2.2.3R](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/ESG/2/?view=chapter)_ requires firms to disclose:

- Their approach to climate-related scenario analysis.
- How they apply climate-related scenario analysis in their investment and risk decision-making process.
- Quantitative examples to demonstrate their approach to climate-related scenario analysis, where reasonably practicable.

_[ESG 2.3.13R and ESG 2.3.14G](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/ESG/2/?view=chapter)_ mean the following metrics need to be disclosed as far as reasonably practicable:

- Climate value-at-risk (VaR)
- Metrics that show the climate warming scenario with which a TCFD product is aligned, such as using an implied temperature rise metric.
- Any other metrics that the firm considers an investor will find useful when deciding whether to select a particular TCFD product.

As the substantive provisions of the SFDR were not onshored as part of Brexit, there is no strict obligation for UK-authorised firms, carrying on business in the UK, to comply with it.

## Listed Companies TCFD Recs

LR 9.8.6R(8) - premium listed  
LR 14.3.27R - standard listed

Explain or comply in the annual report:

Increased transparency of how listed companies are impacted by climate-related risks and opportunities will ensure accurate pricing of securities and help markets to work efficiently.

the Listing Rules require the following companies to state, in their annual report, whether they comply with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures and to explain any non-compliance.

The FCA has indicated that:

- Consistent with the TCFD final report, companies should consider whether disclosures under the strategy and metrics and targets recommendations meet the materiality threshold.
- Disclosures consistent with the TCFD’s governance and risk management recommendations should be made irrespective of a materiality assessment (as is clear from page 17 of the TCFD final report).

In the Listing Rules, there is no definition of "materiality" or materiality tests for companies to assess the information they disclose under LR 9.8.6R(8) and LR 14.3.27R and the FCA does not propose to issue guidance for this.

The legislative and regulatory framework around ESG in the UK is evolving, with the government introducing the Corporate Governance Code and the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2021. These regulations are designed to increase transparency and accountability around ESG issues. In particular, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2021 requires companies to provide a statement of their ESG policies, as well as disclose any material risks and opportunities related to ESG issues. Given the regulatory and legislative framework around ESG in the UK, companies that are compliant with the law become attractive takeover targets for financial investors, as they can provide assurance that the company is committed to upholding ethical standards and managing ESG-related risks. Moreover, such companies may also be viewed as a better long-term investment, given their commitment to sustainable practices and their potential to reduce reputational risks. For example, the acquisition of Vectura Group may have been attractive to Phillip Morris International because of its commitment to ESG issues.

The UK has a comprehensive regulatory framework in place for ESG. This includes legislation at both the European Union and UK levels, as well as codes of practice developed by industry bodies. At the EU level, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) requires large companies to report on non-financial matters, including ESG issues, as part of their annual financial statements. The UK has also implemented its own regulations, such as the Companies Act 2006, which requires directors to have regard to the interests of stakeholders in their decision-making. In addition, the UK has developed a number of codes of practice and guidelines to help companies understand and meet ESG expectations. These include the UK Corporate Governance Code, which outlines best practice for boards of directors in relation to their ESG responsibilities, and the Stewardship Code, which sets out the duties of institutional investors in relation to ESG. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also has a range of rules and guidance relating to ESG. These include the FCA's Principles for Business, which require financial firms to treat their customers fairly and to act in the best interests of their clients when taking ESG into consideration. The FCA also has a range of guidance for firms.

The UK has recently announced new ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) listing rules, which will come into effect from September 2021. These rules require companies to provide more information to investors on how they are managing their ESG risks and exposures and how they are contributing to society. They will require companies to produce an annual ESG report, detailing their ESG objectives, the progress made in meeting them, and the impact their activities have had on the environment and society. Companies will also be required to provide more information on their board's oversight of ESG issues, including considering the long-term sustainability of their business when making decisions. Additionally, companies will have to explain how their executive pay is linked to ESG objectives.

The UK has two specific listing rules related to ESG: the ESG Disclosure Rule and the ESG Engagement Rule. The ESG Disclosure Rule requires listed companies to report on their ESG policies, practices, and performance. This includes disclosures on climate change-related risks and opportunities, the board’s responsibility for ESG matters, and the company’s approach to stakeholder engagement. The ESG Engagement Rule requires listed companies to actively engage with their stakeholders on ESG matters. This includes engaging with investors and other stakeholders on ESG topics, developing policies to address ESG matters, and regularly reporting on ESG-related progress.

Since 1 October 2013 the [Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2013/9780111540169/contents) has required all UK quoted companies to report on their greenhouse gas emissions as part of their annual Directors’ Report.

From 1 April 2019, quoted companies must report on their global energy use and large businesses must disclose their UK annual energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This is required by the [Companies (Directors’ Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/1155/contents/made).
