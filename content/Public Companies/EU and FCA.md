# EU and FCA

## EU Regulation

The regulatory framework governing the listing of companies on the Stock Exchange in the UK has its basis in EU law.

- Original regime regulating the listing of companies: Consolidated Admission and Reporting Directive (CARD) 2001
- 4 more directives:
	- Prospectus Directive
	- Market Abuse Directive (MAD)
	- Transparency Directive
	- Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)
- Key EU goal is the completion of the Capital Markets Union
- MAD replaced by Market Abuse Regulation
- MiFID replaced by MiFID II and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR)

UK regulation: see FSMA 2000 and FCA Handbook.

Following 2008, the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) was set up, based in Paris. This has overarching responsibility for regulating and supervising financial markets. Also makes recommendations and issues opinions.

## Competent Authority

FCA has the primary role over listed companies in the UK. Regulation often refers to FCA as the “competent authority”.

The PRA also regulates certain listed companies like banks, insurance companies and systemically important investment companies.

The FCA has a separate division to perform the specific role of competent authority for listing in the UK, and this is called the UK Listing Authority (UKLA).

### UKLA

The FCA (in its capacity as the UKLA) has responsibility for the official listing of securities under Pt VI FSMA 2000. Includes maintaining the official list, drafting rules, ensuring listed companies comply with their obligations and having the power to sanction any non-compliant listed company.
