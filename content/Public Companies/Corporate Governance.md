# Corporate Governance

## UK Framework

Corporate governance refers to how a company is run. Sources of law:

- Common law,
- CA 2006,
- Listing Rules (in particular, the continuing obligations and Listing Principles),
- Corporate Governance Rules,
- UK Corporate Governance Code,
- Stewardship Code,
- Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410),
- FCA’s Code of Market Conduct
- Various non-legal guidelines.

## UK Corporate Governance Code

UK CGC is a codification of best practice in corporate governance. Companies are required to comply with the UK CGC or, if they do not, to explain their non-compliance.

The UK CGC replaces the previous set of rules known as the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (‘Combined Code’):

- 1995 Combined Code
	- Based on the findings of 3 reports
- 2003 Combined Code
	- Enron and WorldCom scandals prompted further reviews.
- UK Corporate Governance Code
	- Post financial crash
	- Latest version dated July 2018.

### Application

The UK CGC only applies to companies with a premium listing on the Main Market of the Stock Exchange (**not** standard). These companies have an obligation to ‘comply or explain’ with the UK CGC under LR 9.8.6R.

### Structure

The principles of the UK CGC are divided into five sections:

 1. Board Leadership and Company Purpose (five principles);
 2. Division of Responsibilities (four principles);
 3. Composition, Succession and Evaluation (three principles);
 4. Audit, Risk and Internal Control (three principles);
 5. Remuneration (three principles).

Associated guidance includes:

- 2018 UK CGC FAQs
- The FRC’s Guidance on Board Effectiveness (optional)
- The FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting
- The FRC’s Guidance on Audit Committees (optional)

### Compliance

Premium listed companies are not subject to a formal requirement to comply with UK CGC.

> [!action] Comply or explain
> Premium listed companies subject to a requirement to include in its annual financial report a statement, known as a ‘disclosure statement’, which details:
> 1. how it has **applied the principles** set out in the UK CGC in a way which would enable shareholders to evaluate how the principles have been applied (LR 9.8.6R(5)); and
> 2. **whether it has complied** throughout the relevant accounting period with the code provisions set out in the UK CGC and, if it has not, which provisions it has not complied with, the period of non-compliance, and why it has not complied (LR 9.8.6R(6)).

This encourages compliance because any failure to comply risks adverse publicity. Companies which do not comply are often subject to shareholder pressure.

UK CGC says that an alternate approach to following a specific provision is permissible if good governance can be achieved by that other means. Shareholders should pay due regard to the company’s individual circumstances when considering a company’s explanation for a departure from recommended practice.

Overseas companies with a premium listing must also comply (LR 9.8.6R(5) and (6)).

#### Corporate Governance Statement

The Corporate Governance Rules require a listed company (premium or standard) to include a corporate governance statement in its directors’ report in the company’s annual report (DTR 7.2.1R), or in a separate report or on the company’s website (DTR 7.2.9R), containing the information set out in DTR 7.

> [!note]
> There is some overlap with the requirements of DTR 7 and the Listing Rules and the UK CGC. Where a listed company chooses to ‘explain’ rather than ‘comply’ with the UK CGC, it will have to show that it still meets the minimum requirements in DTR 7.

## Directors' Remuneration

Rules:

- Listing Rules
- UK CGC
- Ch 6 & 9, Part 15, CA 2006
- Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008

### CA 2006 Rules and the 2008 Regulations

The CA 2006 rules and the 2008 Regulations (that part which applies to remuneration) apply to ‘quoted companies’. Defined in s 385(2) CA 2006; includes NYSE, NASDAQ, etc. but **not** AIM.

### Key Features

Directors' liability:

- Any director of a company which fails to comply with these requirements will be guilty of an offence under the CA 2006 and liable to a fine.
- A director can also be personally liable to the company for any loss it suffers under s 437CA 2006 for any false or misleading statements in the report, or an omission from it, if he knew or was reckless as to whether the statement was false or misleading, or knew the omission to be a dishonest concealment of a material fact.

#### Directors' Remuneration Report

s 420 CA 2006: the company must produce an annual directors’ remuneration report (DRR) which contains the information required by Sch 8 to the 2008 Regulations, made under s 421 and s 422A(4) of the CA 2006, in the form prescribed by the Regulations. The report forms part of the annual report and accounts and must be filed at Companies House (CA 2006, s 439).

DRR must include:

1. Annual report on remuneration
	- Directors' actual remuneration set out in a specified table form.
	- Must include single figure and breakdown.
	- Include comparative tables and graphs.
	- Policy details and details of any required shareholder votes.
2. Directors' remuneration policy
	- Must be voted on by shareholders at least once every 3 years.
	- Rules on content and presentation.
	- Illustrations of how the remuneration policy would affect each executive director if the company’s share price rose 50% over the period of performance targets.

#### Audit of DRR

s 497 CA 2006: the company's auditors must audit the DRR.

#### Shareholder Approval

Every listed company must send a copy of its annual accounts and reports (including, under CA 2006, s 471(3), the DRR) to every shareholder (CA 2006, s 423). The company must then table the DRR at a general meeting (CA 2006, s 437). Two separate shareholder votes need to be considered, one for each part of the DRR.

- Annual report on remuneration
	- Once a year the company must obtain approval of the annual report on remuneration (by ordinary resolution) of the shareholders (CA 2006, s 439).
	- Does not mean that any specific director’s service contract is conditional upon shareholder approval (CA 2006, s 439). If shareholders do not approve the annual report on remuneration, the effect is advisory only.
- Directors remuneration policy
	- s 439A CA 2006, at least once every three years the shareholders must hold a binding vote by ordinary resolution on the directors’ remuneration policy for the company, or sooner if it wishes to alter the policy.
	- If the OR is not passed, the company can:
		- continue to use the previously approved policy;
		- continue with the previous policy and seek shareholder approval of specific remuneration; or
		- put a revised policy forward for a vote at a later GM.
	- Once the company has received approval for its new remuneration policy, any obligation to make a payment that would be in contravention of the policy will have no effect under s 226E(1) CA 2006.
	- If a payment has already been made, it is deemed to be held by the director on trust for the company, and any director who authorised the payment will be jointly and severally liable to indemnify the company for any loss resulting from the making of the payment (s 226E(2) CA 2006)
	- s 439A(2) CA 2006: if the ordinary resolution on shareholders approval of the directors’ remuneration report is not passed, it will need to put the directors’ remuneration policy back to the shareholders the following year for re-approval in a binding vote.

## Institutional Investors

It is really the institutional investors who enforce the UK CGC by making life difficult for those companies who do not comply.

### UK Stewardship Code

- New voluntary code published by the FRC.
- Purpose: to improve corporate governance and long-term returns to shareholders through promoting better dialogue between shareholders and the boards of directors of listed companies.

> [!defn] Stewardship
> The responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society (Stewardship Code).

- Operates on an ‘apply and explain’ basis.
- Institutional investors who wish to apply the Stewardship Code must submit an annual compliance report to the FRC.
- If accepted, the institutional investor becomes a signatory to the Code and the report is made public.

### Investment Protection Committees

Increased awareness of the importance of good corporate governance. Certain IPCs, such as the PLSA and PIRC, publish their corporate governance expectations and circulate them to shareholders and listed companies.

The Investment Association maintains the Public Register which it describes as the world’s first register tracking shareholder dissent at listed companies.

## Shareholder Rights Directive

EU Shareholder Rights Directive was adopted in June 2007. seeks to improve the way that companies trade on regulated markets in the EU by improving shareholder information and rights to participate in general meetings. The Directive applies to companies on the Main Market but not to those on AIM.

### Notice Periods for GMs

The CA 2006 allowed general meetings of listed companies (not being the AGM) to be held on not less than 14 clear days’ notice. Under a new s 307A the notice period must be 21 clear days unless:

1. the company offers all shareholders the right to vote electronically (which can be met by the company enabling all shareholders to appoint a proxy via a website); and
2. shareholders pass a special resolution each year at the AGM resolving that only 14 clear days’ notice is required for such meetings,  
 in which case the notice period can be 14 clear days.

The PLSA has adopted a restrictive position, stating that the 14-day period should only be used in limited circumstances and for time-sensitive matters where its use would be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. The PLSA suggests that shareholders vote against any resolution proposed at a 14-day notice meeting if the use of this shorter notice period has not been adequately justified.

When companies propose the resolution to enable meetings to be held on 14 days’ notice, the PLSA also requires a statement in the AGM notice of ‘the circumstances in which a short notice meeting may be called’.

### Contents of Notice

The following additional information must now be included in the notice calling a meeting of a listed company (s 311(2), s 337(3)):

1. website containing the information relating to the general meeting;
	1. Section 311A requires a listed company to publish certain specified information in advance of the meeting on a website on or before the date on which notice of a meeting is given including the matters set out in the notice itself and details of the company’s share capital. The information must be kept on the website for at least two years.
	2. After the meeting, s 341(1A) requires additional information about poll votes to be posted on the website, such as the number of votes for and against and abstentions.
2. a statement that the right to vote is by reference to the Register of Members and the time when the right to vote will be determined;
3. how to attend and vote including deadlines;
4. forms for appointing proxies;
	- The company must provide an electronic address for the return of proxies (s 333A).
	- Section 327(A1) and s 330(A1) require the appointment and termination respectively of a proxy by a shareholder in a listed company to be in writing.
5. procedure for voting in advance/ electronic voting (if applicable); and
6. if the AGM notice is sent out more than six weeks before the meeting it must contain a statement about the shareholders’ rights to:
	1. ask questions at the meeting;
		- new right, under s 319A, for shareholders to ask questions at a meeting which the company must cause to be answered unless an exception applies.
	2. give notice of a resolution at the meeting; and
	3. include a matter in the business of the meeting.
		- In addition to the existing right of shareholders (holding either at least 5% of the voting rights of the company or being at least 100 in number owning shares with an average paid-up capital of at least £100 per shareholder) to requisition a resolution at an AGM, they have a new right in s 338A to require the company to include ‘a matter’ (not being a resolution) in the business of the AGM.
