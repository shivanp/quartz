# Issuing Shares

Once a listed company has created a class of shares, the company will want to use the shares to raise capital. Involves issuing shares to shareholders in return for consideration. Public companies have complex share structures. Listed companies should consider:

- Guidelines issued by the Investment Association
- Statement of Principles by the Pre-Emption Group; and
- Listing Rules.

## Terminology

### Issuing/ Transferring

- On a share issue, the company is party to the transaction and receives money for the share
- On a share transfer, the parties will be the buying and selling shareholders.

### Allotting/ Issuing

- Often used interchangeably.
- s 558 CA 2006: shares are allotted when a person acquires the unconditional right to be included in the company's register of members in respect of those shares
- Case law: shares are issued when the allottee's name is registered in the register of members ([[National Westminster Bank plc and Another v IRC and Barclays Bank plc [1994] 2 BCLC 30]]).

## Key Questions

In relation to an issue of shares, consider;

1. Limit on the number of shares?
2. Authority to allot? (s 551)
3. Pre-emption rights? (s 561).

## Limit of Number of Shares

- Companies formed after 01/10/09 can place a limit on the number of shares which can be issued.
- Companies formed before 01/10/09 were required to have restrictions on the number of shares they could issue (authorised share capital) in their memorandum.
- s 28: provisions automatically treated as restrictions in the articles.

### Checking Articles and Issued Share Capital

- Check articles for any restrictions on the issue (see Companies House)
- Check memorandum for a pre-CA 2006 company
- Check latest statement of capital to find current issued share capital (e.g., the company will have filed a return of allotment Form SH01 within 1 month of the allotment of new shares).
- Ensure these filings are up to date.

### Checking Guidelines

Check whether Investment Association guidelines or Pre-emption Group Statement of Principles have an effect on whether the company can issue new shares.

### Removing Limit

- s 21 CA 2006: company articles can be changed by special resolution.
	- Written resolution under s 288 CA 2006 not available to a public company.
- If there is an existing limit for a company formed before 01/10/09, the limit can be removed:
	1. By ordinary resolution to remove the limit
	2. By special resolution to adopt new articles without a limit
	3. By special resolution amending the articles authorising the directors to allot shares in excess of the limit.
- ss 29 & 30: a copy of the resolution and amended articles must be sent to Companies House within 15 days of the date of the resolution (s 30(1)). Company and every officer liable to a fine if not (s 30(2), (3)).

### Listing Rules

- Premium listed company must publish a circular giving information on the change of articles and the issue of new securities, including arrangements for the allotment.
- FCA approval not required for the circular (LR 13.2.1R).
- LR 13.8.10R; must include:
	- an explanation of the effect of the proposed amendments
	- Full terms of amendments/ statement that they are available for inspection (at a place in/ near the City of London + the place of the GM for $\geq 15$ mins before the meeting).
	- Company must file a copy of the resolution and circular with the NSM and notify an RIS it has done so (LR 9.6.1R, LR 9.6.2R, LR 9.6.3R).
	- Proposed alteration to premium/ standard listed company's capital structure must be notified to an RIS asap (LR 9.6.4R(1), LR 14.3.17R).

## Authority to Allot

### S 551 CA 2006

Prohibits directors from allotting relevant securities unless authorised to do so by

1. Articles
2. Ordinary resolution.

Section 551 applies to:

1. the allotment of any type of share (ordinary and preference) (s 551(1)(a)) other than–
	1. the subscriber shares (s 559), and
	2. shares allotted under an employee share scheme (see 13.9 ) (s 549(2)(a)); and
2. the grant of any right to subscribe for, or convert to, any type of share (s 551(1)(b)) other than under an employee share scheme (s 549(2)(b)).

Effect of s 551(1)(b): brings more than just shares within the ambit of s 551. This includes:

| Instrument                    | Description                                                              | Within s 551?                                                                                                                         | When is authority needed?                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Convertible loan stock        | Class of debt security carrying the right to convert into [[Shares]].    | Yes provided it does not convert to employee share scheme shares.                                                                     | When debt securities are allotted (s 549(3)). |
| Options                       | Option to subscribe for shares (other than employee share scheme shares) | Yes                                                                                                                                   | At the time of the grant of the option.       |
| Convertible preference shares | Share carrying the right to convert into ordinary shares.                | Yes - s 551(1)(a) catches initial allotment of preference shares, s 551(1)(b) catches the right of preference shares to be converted. | When the convertible preference shares are allotted. Authority will need to cover both the convertible preference shares and the ordinary shares they convert into.                                               |

> 
> (8) A resolution of a company to give, vary, revoke or renew authorisation under this section may be an ordinary resolution, even though it amends the company's articles.

### Existing S 551 Authority

In particular, check:

- The date on which s 551 authority expires; and
- The maximum amount of relevant securities which can be allotted under it.

### New S 551 Authority

Section 551(8) provides that whether the original authority was given in the articles of association, or by ordinary resolution, it can be renewed by ordinary resolution.

### Resolution

Under s 551(2) of the CA 2006, the authority can be restricted to a specific allotment, or it can be drafted as a general power to allot.

s 551(3) provides that the authority must include two key pieces of information:

1. expiry date;
	- 5 years from either date on which company incorporated/ date of resolution.
	- In practice, listed companies grant directors a new s 551 authority each year at the AGM to comply with Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines.
2. the maximum amount of shares which can be allotted under it.
	- Usually stated as a maximum nominal amount rather than a maximum amount of shares (so it doesn't matter if the company consolidates/ subdivides shares).
	- Maximum amount relates to the shares which will be issued on exercise of the right.
	- Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines impose a limit on this amount.

#### Notify Companies House

- Under s 555 of the CA 2006 the company must file with Companies House within one month a return of the allotment together with a statement of capital (SH01).
- Under s 554, directors must register an allotment as soon as practicable, but no later than two months after the allotment, otherwise an offence will have been committed.
- The lawyer must also ensure that the s 551 ordinary resolution is filed at Companies House within 15 days of it being passed.

### Listing Rules

LR 13.8.1R provides that when a premium listed company sends out the s 551 resolution to its shareholders, the explanatory circular (which does not require approval by the FCA (LR 13.2.1R)) must include the following information:

1. a statement of:
	1. the **maximum amount** of relevant securities which the directors will have authority to allot, and
	2. the **percentage** which that amount represents of the total issued ordinary share capital as at the latest practicable date before publication of the circular;
2. a statement by the directors as to whether they have any **present intention** of exercising the authority, and if so for what **purpose**; and
3. a statement as to whether the authority will **lapse**.

- Must also include info relating to any treasury shares held.
- The company must file a copy of the resolution and circular with the NSM, and notify an RIS that it has done so (LR 9.6.1R, LR 9.6.2R and LR 9.6.3R).

### Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines

The Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines provide that the maximum amount of relevant securities for which authority can be given is **one-third** of the issued ordinary share capital.

The Investment Association will accept an authority to allow the allotment of a **further one-third** of the issued share capital, provided that the additional authority is only used for fully pre-emptive rights issues and both the general and additional authorities expire at the next AGM (rather than up to five years for a general authority).

The guidelines are non-statutory – discussion with the Investment Association is possible.

### Sanctions for Breach

Breach of s 551 does not actually invalidate the share allotment (CA 2006, s 549(6)). However, s 549(4) and (5) provide that any director who knowingly and wilfully contravenes, or permits or authorises a contravention of, s 551 is liable to a fine.

## Allotment Pre-emption

> [!question]
> Do the pre-emption rights under s 561 apply to the allotment? Does the company need to disapply them?

> [!defn]
> A pre-emption right on allotment is a right of first refusal for existing shareholders on an issue of shares by a company. When a company wants to issue shares, it must first offer those shares to the existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.

The right of pre-emption protects the shareholders against the dilution of their shareholdings. Provisions found in:

- CA 2006
- Listing Rules
- Articles of Association
- Deed of issue of any convertible securities/ options.

### S 561 CA 2006

> [!statute] s 561 CA 2006
> (1) A company must not allot equity securities to a person on any terms unless—
> 
> - (a) it has made an offer to each person who holds ordinary shares in the company to allot to him on the same or more favourable terms a proportion of those securities that is as nearly as practicable equal to the proportion in nominal value held by him of the ordinary share capital of the company, and
> 
> - (b) the period during which any such offer may be accepted has expired or the company has received notice of the acceptance or refusal of every offer so made.
> 
> (2) Securities that a company has offered to allot to a holder of ordinary shares may be allotted to him, or anyone in whose favour he has renounced his right to their allotment, without contravening subsection (1)(b).

Provides statutory pre-emption rights on allotment. A company proposing to issue equity securities in return for cash must first offer the shares to holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal value of their existing shareholdings.

> [!defn] Equity securities
> The shares the company is proposing to issue which might trigger pre-emption rights, so that those equity securities must be offered first to those people who have pre-emption rights; and

> [!defn] Ordinary shares
> The shares which entitle their owners to pre-emption rights, so that their owners are offered first refusal over an issue of equity securities.

### Equity Securities

> [!statute] s 560(1)
> - “equity securities” means—
> 	- (a) ordinary shares in the company, or
> 	- (b) rights to subscribe for, or to convert securities into, ordinary shares in the company;
> - “ordinary shares” means shares other than shares that as respects dividends and capital carry a right to participate only up to a specified amount in a distribution.

So equity securities are:

1. any ‘ordinary shares’ in the company, other than:
	1. a subscriber share (s 577),
	2. a bonus share (s 564),
	3. shares held under an employees’ share scheme (s 566), and
	4. shares allotted pursuant to a right to subscribe (s 549(3)); and
2. any right to subscribe for, or convert securities into, ordinary shares.

![[Equity securities]]

> [!warning]
> Under LR 9.3.11R, holders of "equity shares" in a premium-listed company only are entitled to be offered "equity securities" on an issue of "equity securities".  Under the statutory pre-emption right (s561 CA 2006) holders of "ordinary shares" are entitled to be offered "equity securities" on a pre-emptive basis. The Listing Rules definition of "equity securities" however is narrower than the s560 CA 2006 definition of "equity securities" in that it doesn't include rights to subscribe for ordinary shares.

### For Cash

Section 565 provides that the pre-emption rights under s 561(1) will apply only if the issue of shares is **wholly** in return for cash. Section 583 of the CA 2006 defines a payment of cash to include cash or cheque.

### Ordinary Shares

Shares that entitle their owners to benefit from pre-emption rights in the event that the company issues equity securities. These have an uncapped element.

#### Right to Subscribe for/ Convert into Ordinary Shares

Falls within the definition of equity securities, but outside the definition of ordinary shares. So the issue of such a right will trigger the pre-emption rights, but those rights to subscribe/ convert will not entitle their owners to pre-emption rights.

- Convertible loan stock
	- Loan stock is an equity security (s 560(1)(b)).
	- Issue of convertible loan stock for cash triggers s 561 pre-emption rights.
- Convertible preference shares
	- If participating, caught by the definition of equity securities (they are ordinary shares) and trigger pre-emption rights if issued for cash.
	- If non-participating, not ordinary shares but caught by (b) $\rightarrow$ issue of shares for cash will trigger pre-emption rights.

#### Employee Share Schemes

> [!statute] s 566 - Exceptions to pre-emption right: employees' share schemes
> 
> Section 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption) does not apply to the allotment of equity securities that would, apart from any renunciation or assignment of the right to their allotment, be held under or allotted or transferred pursuant to an employees' share scheme.

Employee share scheme shares will not trigger the s 561 pre-emption provisions when they are issued, but, once issued, they will entitle their owners to pre-emption rights in the event that the company issues equity securities.

#### Bonus/ Subscriber Shares

Sections 564 and 577 state that the allotment of bonus/subscriber shares will not trigger pre-emption rights, but holders of bonus and subscriber shares will be entitled to pre-emption rights provided they are ordinary shares and are not excluded because they carry only a limited right to participate in income and share capital.

1. Equity securities which can trigger pre-emption rights when they are issued (that is they must be offered pro rata to the existing shareholders):
	 1. ordinary shares;
	 2. participating preference shares; and
	 3. rights to subscribe for, or convert into, ordinary or participating preference shares.
2. Securities which are not equity securities and cannot trigger pre-emption rights when they are issued:
	 1. non-participating preference shares;
	 2. employee share scheme shares;
	 3. any share issued for non-cash consideration;
	 4. bonus shares; and
	 5. subscriber shares.
3. ‘Ordinary shares’ which entitle their owners to pre-emption rights on an issue of equity securities (in other words, these shareholders will expect a pro rata offer of the equity securities being offered):
	 1. ordinary shares;
	 2. participating preference shares;
	 3. employee share scheme shares (if they are (i) or (ii) above);
	 4. bonus shares (if they are (i) or (ii) above); and
	 5. subscriber shares (if they are (i) or (ii) above).
4. Shares which do not entitle their owners to pre-emption rights on an issue of equity securities (in other words, these shareholders cannot expect a pro rata offer of the equity securities being offered):
	 1. non-participating preference shares;
	 2. rights to subscribe for, or to convert into, ordinary or participating preference shares.

### Pre-emption Rights on Allotment

Premium listed companies only must, in addition to the statutory pre-emption rights, comply with pre-emption rights on allotment (LR 9.3.11R). The Listing Rules rights apply just to premium listed companies. These will usually be UK-registered, but they may also be registered overseas and so not subject to the CA 2006.

> [!important]
> On an issue of equity securities for cash, there is a continuing obligation on a premium listed company to offer those shares first to the existing equity shareholders (of shares of that class, or of another class who are entitled to be offered them) in proportion to their existing holdings. 

An issue by a premium listed company pursuant to the pre-emption rights set out in LR 9.3.11R is known as a ‘rights issue’ or an ‘open offer’.

Similar but not identical to CA 2006 provisions.

LR 9.3.12R(2) provides that a company does not need to comply with the pre-emption rights in LR 9.3.11R in relation to equity shares which:

- represent fractional entitlements; or
- the directors think it is necessary or expedient to exclude from any offer due to legal problems under the laws of any territory or due to any regulatory body,  
where there is a disapplication in a rights issue or an open offer, used solely in respect of the shares covered by (a) and (b) above, rather than generally for all shares.

LR 9.3.12R(3) and LR 9.3.12R(4) provide that the pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules will not apply if the company is selling treasury shares for cash to an employee share scheme, or if the company is an overseas company with a primary listing.

s 561 says nothing about fractional entitlements, so in practice entitlements are rounded down. To comply with s 561 without making an offer in jurisdictions outside the EEA with onerous requirements, companies must follow the procedure under s 562(3) of the CA 2006, known as the ‘ Gazette route’.

Note that there are no pre-emption rights on transfer in the Listing Rules.

### Disapplication of CA 2006 Pre-emption Rights

Public companies can disapply pre-emption rights under ss 570 and 571 of the CA 2006.

#### Specific Disapplication (s 571)

> [!statute] s 571 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights by special resolution
> 
> (1) Where the directors of a company are authorised for the purposes of section 551 (power of directors to allot shares etc: authorisation by company), whether generally or otherwise, the company may by special resolution resolve that section 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption)—
> - (a) does not apply to a specified allotment of equity securities to be made pursuant to that authorisation, or
> - (b) applies to such an allotment with such modifications as may be specified in the resolution.
> 
> (2) Where such a resolution is passed the provisions of this Chapter have effect accordingly.
> 
> (3) A special resolution under this section ceases to have effect when the authorisation to which it relates—
> - (a) is revoked, or
> - (b) would (if not renewed) expire.
> 
> But if the authorisation is renewed the resolution may also be renewed, for a period not longer than that for which the authorisation is renewed, by a special resolution of the company.
> 
> (4) Notwithstanding that any such resolution has expired, the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of an offer or agreement previously made by the company if the resolution enabled the company to make an offer or agreement that would or might require equity securities to be allotted after it expired.
> 
> (5) A special resolution under this section, or a special resolution to renew such a resolution, must not be proposed unless—
> - (a) it is recommended by the directors, and
> - (b) the directors have complied with the following provisions.
> 
> (6) Before such a resolution is proposed, the directors must make a written statement setting out—
> - (a) their reasons for making the recommendation,
> - (b) the amount to be paid to the company in respect of the equity securities to be allotted, and
> - (c) the directors' justification of that amount.
> 
> (7) The directors' statement must—
> - (a) if the resolution is proposed as a written resolution, be sent or submitted to every eligible member at or before the time at which the proposed resolution is sent or submitted to him;
> - (b) if the resolution is proposed at a general meeting, be circulated to the members entitled to notice of the meeting with that notice.

A disapplication of pre-emption rights in relation to a specific allotment must be effected by a special resolution. However, this is not a popular method because of the requirements of s 571(5)–(7). This provides that before the resolution is proposed, the directors must recommend that the resolution be passed and circulate a written statement setting out:

1. their reasons for making the recommendation;
2. the amount of consideration for the shares; and
3. the justification of that amount.

The statement must be circulated to the members before the general meeting to pass the special resolution. The directors risk up to 12 months’ imprisonment or a fine if the statement contains anything which is materially misleading, false or deceptive (s 572).

#### General Disapplication (s 570)

The disapplication can be effected either by special resolution, which is most common, or by a provision in the articles. Unlike under s 571, the directors are not required to make any recommendation in relation to the resolution.

> [!statute] s 570 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights: directors acting under general authorisation
> 
> (1) Where the directors of a company are generally authorised for the purposes of section 551 (power of directors to allot shares etc: authorisation by company), they may be given power by the articles, or by a special resolution of the company, to allot equity securities pursuant to that authorisation as if section 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption)—
> - (a) did not apply to the allotment, or
> - (b) applied to the allotment with such modifications as the directors may determine.
> 
> (2) Where the directors make an allotment under this section, the provisions of this Chapter have effect accordingly.
> 
> (3) The power conferred by this section ceases to have effect when the authorisation to which it relates—
> - (a) is revoked, or
> - (b) would (if not renewed) expire.
> 
> But if the authorisation is renewed the power may also be renewed, for a period not longer than that for which the authorisation is renewed, by a special resolution of the company.
> 
> (4) Notwithstanding that the power conferred by this section has expired, the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of an offer or agreement previously made by the company if the power enabled the company to make an offer or agreement that would or might require equity securities to be allotted after it expired.

#### Duration

Disapplication only effective until the s 551 authority to which it relates expires (s 570(3)). So the disapplication cannot last $> 5$ years.

#### Notifying Companies House

The company must file a copy of the s 570 (or 571) resolution at Companies House within 15 days of its being passed (s 29(1)(a) and s 30).

### Disapplication Under Listing Rules

- LR 9.3.12R(1): a general disapplication by the shareholders of their statutory pre-emption rights in accordance with s 570 (or 571) of the CA 2006 will also dispense with the pre-emption rights under LR 9.3.11R.
- In practice, most public companies effect a general disapplication of the statutory pre-emption rights at each AGM, at the same time that they take any s 551 authority.
- Even though this dispenses of LR pre-emption rights, many listed companies prefer to state in the resolution that they will nevertheless comply with the pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules.

#### Communication with Shareholders

If the company has a premium listing, it will need to observe the continuing obligations of the Listing Rules relating to communications with shareholders.

Listing Rule 13.8.2R provides that a circular should accompany the s 570 or s 571 disapplication containing the following information:

1. a statement of the maximum amount of equity securities that the disapplication will cover; and
2. (in the case of a general disapplication in respect of equity securities for cash made otherwise than to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings) the percentage which the amount generally disapplied represents of the total ordinary share capital in issue as at the latest practicable date before publication of the circular.

The company must file a copy of the resolution and circular with the NSM, and notify an RIS that it has done so (LR 9.6.2R, LR 9.6.1R and LR 9.6.3R).

### Pre-emption Group's Statement of Principles

Institutional investors do not generally support issues of new shares by listed companies other than by way of a rights issue, because otherwise the issue will dilute a shareholder’s shareholding, resulting in a smaller share of the company’s profit (dividend) and a smaller percentage of voting rights.

Pre-Emption Group members consist of listed companies, investors and intermediaries. The Principles are supported by the PLSA and the Investment Association. They reflect the position that the powerful institutional shareholders will take in relation to any s 570 disapplication.

Paragraph 1 of Part 1 of the Statement: the Principles apply to equity issues for cash, **other than on a pre-emptive basis**, by UK and non-UK companies.

#### General Disapplications

A general disapplication is one sought by a company at an AGM other than for the purpose of an identified, proposed issue of ordinary shares (Part 2A, para 1). While the company needs to explain why the disapplication is required, and notify shareholders of the need for it in good time, shareholders are likely to agree in principle with such requests.

> [!guid] When a general disapplication is likely to be supported by institutional shareholders
> 1. when the company is seeking authority to issue **non-pre-emptively $\leq 5\%$** issued ordinary share capital in any one year (regardless of the purpose) (Part 2A, para 3);
> 2. when the company is seeking authority to issue **non-pre-emptively** no more than an **additional 5%** of issued ordinary share capital provided that the company intends to use it only in connection with an **acquisition or specified capital investment** which is announced together with the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding **six-month** period;
> 3. a company should not issue more than **7.5% of its ordinary share capital for cash**, other than to existing shareholders, in any rolling three year period (excluding a disapplication for an acquisition or specified capital investment or a specific disapplication, unless:
> 	1. it has consulted suitably in advance, or
> 	2. the matter was specifically highlighted when the disapplication request was made (Part 2B, para 2); and
> 4. the price at which the shares are proposed to be issued should be at a **discount** of no more than **5%** (Part 2B, para 5).

A disapplication should not be granted for more than 15 months or until the next AGM, whichever is the shorter (Part 2A, para 4).

#### Specific Disapplications

In Part 3, the Principles recognise that some requests to disapply pre-emption rights might be non-general (i.e. ‘specific’) but nevertheless in the interests of the company and its shareholders. Any request for a specific disapplication should be considered by shareholders on a case by case basis.

##### Where

Any specific disapplication should be made at a specially convened GM, unless the company is in a position to provide all the necessary information to shareholders at its AGM, in which case the request can be made at the AGM (Part 2A, para 5).

#### Procedure

The company must communicate with shareholders as soon as possible (Part 1, para 5). Following the granting of a general disapplication, the company should publish in its annual report certain information about the non-pre-emptive issue, such as the level of discount, the amount raised and how it was used (Part 2B, para 9).

### Sanctions for Breach of S 561

A breach of s 561 will not invalidate or cancel an allotment. However, s 563 of the CA 2006 provides that the company and any director who knowingly permitted the breach are jointly and severally liable to compensate any person to whom the shares should have been offered under the pre-emption rights.

## Issuing Shares

Before the shares are issued, also consider:

- Directors' duties
	- s 172 promote success of company
	- s 171 actin in accordance with constitution + only exercise powers for their proper purpose.
- Financial assistance
	- General prohibition on a public company providing financial help to anyone acquiring shares.

### Consideration

Where the issuer of shares is a public company, s 585(1) of the CA 2006 provides that it cannot accept consideration in the form of an undertaking:

- to do work; or
- to perform services.

A public company cannot allot shares as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash, if the consideration is or includes an undertaking which will, or may, be performed more than five years after the date of the allotment (s 587(1)) - “long-term undertaking”.

### Issuing Shares at a Discount

> [!statute] s 580 - Shares not to be allotted at a discount
> (1) A company's shares must not be allotted at a discount.
> 
> (2) If shares are allotted in contravention of this section, the allottee is liable to pay the company an amount equal to the amount of the discount, with interest at the appropriate rate.

Public company: each share (other than a share allotted pursuant to an employee share scheme) must be paid up at least as to one-quarter of its nominal value, together with the whole of any premium paid on it.

Pre-emption Group’s Principles provide that a listed company should not issue any share under s 570 or s 571 disapplication (on a non-pre-emptive basis) at a discount of $>5\%$ of its market value. **Exception**: if the pre-emption requirements of LRs are followed.

### Valuation of Non-cash Consideration

> [!statute] s 593(1)
> A public company must not allot shares as fully or partly paid up (as to their nominal value or any premium on them) otherwise than in cash unless—
> - (a) the consideration for the allotment has been independently valued in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter,
> - (b) the valuer's report has been made to the company during the six months immediately preceding the allotment of the shares, and
> - (c) a copy of the report has been sent to the proposed allottee.

One important exception relates to a ‘share-for-share exchange’, that is, when the consideration for the issue of shares by one company is shares in another company. In this case, no valuation is required (s 594).

### Class Rights

Check that the issue will not vary any existing class rights.

### Prospectus Regulation

Analyse the terms of the share issue to check whether a prospectus is required.

### Filing Details

Notify the Registrar of any allotment of shares within one month of the allotment, by completing and delivering Form SH01 to Companies House. Note that the form must include a brief description of the consideration for which the shares were allotted.
