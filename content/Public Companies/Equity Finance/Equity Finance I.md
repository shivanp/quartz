# Equity Finance

A company seeking to float can do so in a number of ways:

- Public offer
- Placing
- Introduction
- Intermediaries offer

Equity finance involves using equity securities (e.g., shares) to raise finance.

```ad-note
title: Terminology
- A secondary issue can refer to a subsequent issue of shares by the company following an IPO
- Also refers to a transfer by a shareholder of existing shares. 
```

## Purpose

Reasons for raising equity finance:

- Paying off debt
- Buying something
- Improving bank balance
- Gearing concerns

## Regulations

- MAR 17 general disclosure obligation
- Listing Rules continuing obligations
- Corporate governance, misleading statements, market manipulation, market abuse, insider dealing.

### Admitting Shares to Listing and Trading

- Company cannot choose to list only part of a class of shares.
- If a listed company proposes to issue more shares of a class already listed, must seek admission to listing on Official List and admission to trading on Main Market.
- Under the Listing Rules, the on-the-day documents differ on a secondary issue to those required for an IPO: a Pricing Statement, rather than Shareholder Statement signed by the sponsor, is required (LR 3.3.3R).
- Under the Admission and Disclosure Standards, the application for admission to trading (Form 1) should be submitted with other 2-day documents, rather than 10 days in advance.
- In the context of a rights issue, once shares have been admitted to listing and trading nil paid, no further application is required to admit them fully paid.

## Documentation

### Prospectus

An FCA-approved prospectus is required if a company wishes to

- Offer securities to the public in the UK (Art 3(1) UK Prospectus Regulation)
- Request admission of transferable securities to trading on a regulated market situated or operating in the UK (Art 3(3))

Art 1(4) UK Prospectus Regulation set out exemptions where an offer to the public will not require a prospectus. Art 1(5) UK Prospectus Regulation sets out when an admission to trading will not require a prospectus.

#### Full Prospectus

2 possibilities regarding the content of a prospectus:

- Full prospectus required for an IPO
	- Contents prescribed by UK PR Regulation annexes.
- Secondary issues
	- Annexes 1, 11, 20

#### Simplified Disclosure Prospectus

- UK Prospectus Regulation simplified disclosure regime: Art 14.
- Applies to a company whose shares have been admitted to trading on a UK regulated market continuously for $\geq 18$ months and is issuing further shares of the same type.
- Must include information set out in Annexes 3, 13, 20.
- Company eligible to use the simplified procedure may decide to produce a full prospectus anyway.

#### Supplementary Prospectus

- Supplementary prospectus required if there is material new information/ material mistake etc.
- Triggers statutory withdrawal rights (Art 23(2)) - i.e., investors who have already subscribed can back out.

#### Exemptions

Exemptions may apply on a secondary issue which mean a prospectus is not required.

![[equity-fin-prospectus.png]]

### Circular

- DTRs require a listed company to communicate to shareholders by way of circular on a new issue.
- Often the requirement for the circular is met by the prospectus.
- But separate sometimes for overseas shareholders.

### Other Documentation

- Any new issue of listed securities must be notified to an RIS under specific disclosure requirements.
- SPA if the company is issuing shares as consideration for the acquisition of a non-cash asset.
- Underwriting agreement if the issue is underwritten.
- Placing agreement if there is a placing.

## Methods

Main methods:

1. Rights issue
2. Open offer
3. Placing
4. Acquisition issue
5. Vendor consideration placing.

On an IPO, multiple methods are usually combined.

## Rights Issue

```ad-defn
Defined in Appendix 1.1 LR:
- an offer to issue new shares or transfer existing shares (or other securities);
- to existing shareholders (or security holders) in proportion to their existing holdings;
- made by way of the issue of a renounceable letter;
- which may be traded ‘nil paid’ for a period before payment for the shares (or other securities) is due.
```

Aim: to raise capital through the issue of new shares.

### Price

- Usually allotted for cash at a discount to the market price.
- Current market practice: making a “deep-discount rights issue” $\rightarrow$ less need for underwriting, shares more attractive.
- Note that as long as the price exceeds the nominal value of the share (CA 2006, s 580), there is no legal limit to the discount at which the company can sell the shares.
- The Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles does not apply if the company observes the pre-emption requirements of the Listing Rules.

### Structure

The offer to shareholders is made by renounceable letter (provisional allotment letter – PAL). Provisionally allots to the shareholder her pro rata entitlement of shares.

- The company has given the shareholder a document which sets out her right to buy the new shares.
- The PAL will provide details of the rights issue, including the number of shares to which the shareholder is entitled and the price of those shares.
- The PAL is a temporary document of title, and as such it must comply with the requirements of LR 9.5.15R for a premium listed company and LR 14.3.9R requirements for a standard listed company.

On receiving the PAL, the shareholder can:

1. Take up the rights by subscribing for the shares
	- Submit consideration and the PAL to the company's receiving agents.
	- Ensures shareholder's existing % shareholding is not diluted.
2. Renounce the rights and sell them to a third party, nil paid
	- Shareholder may incur an immediate capital gains tax charge if she sells her rights.
	- Shareholder wishing to renounce and sell rights shouldn't find it difficult to find a buyer.
	- Risk to buyer: market price droping .
3. Take up some rights and renounce the rest
	- May be used where the shareholder has insufficient funds to buy the whole allocation or does not wish to take up all her rights.
	- The proceeds received from trading some of the rights may help to finance the purchase of the balance of these rights (known as ‘tail swallowing’).
4. Do nothing.
	- “Lazy shareholders”
	- Even lazy shareholders can benefit from a rights issue, because arrangements are made for the sale of any shares not taken up.
	- Lazy shareholder may still receive a cash payment to the extent the shares which were provisionally allotted are sold in the market for more than their subscription price.
	- For premium listed companies only, the proceeds must exceed £5 (LR 9.5.4R).

#### Nil Paid Dealings

- PAL is negotiable (= can be transferred by delivery).
- Offer must be open for $\geq 14$ days
- Nil paid dealings can take place during 14 day period.
	- A shareholder can trade the rights to subscribe simply by signing the PAL and passing it on to someone else.
	- These dealings are referred to as ‘nil paid dealings’ because trading takes place before any subscription monies have been paid for the shares represented by the PAL.
- Then the third party can exercise the right to subscribe in the normal way.
- It is on the admission of the shares to trading in nil paid form that the FCA will grant admission of the shares to the Official List (LR 9.5.3G).

### Timing

The FCA does not allow shares in listed companies to be allotted provisionally on a conditional basis (LR 2.1.5G). This means the PALs can be posted only after all necessary shareholder approvals have been obtained at the GM.

#### Premium Listed Company

- Once the PALs are posted, LR 9.5.6R provides that the offer must remain open for at least 10 business days.
	- The first business day will be the first day the rights issue offer is open for acceptance. This will be the day of the posting of the PAL.
- Section 562(5) states that the offer must be open for 14 days.
	- This section will only be relevant if s 561 is not disapplied.
	- The first day is counted from the day of making the offer. This therefore starts from the day of posting the PAL.
- N.B. 10 business days could be longer than 14 days depending on public holidays.

```ad-tip
A standard listed company is only subject to the requirements of the CA 2006, including s 562(5) above.
```

### Underwriting

The underwriters (usually an investment bank or a broker) basically guarantee that the company will receive the equity finance it seeks, by agreeing to take up, at no less than the subscription price under the rights issue, any shares which are not taken up by shareholders and which cannot be sold in the market – including fractional entitlements if s 561 has been disapplied.

```ad-defn
These shares are referred to as ‘the rump’.
```

Any premium received over the subscription price must be given to the person to whom the shares were provisionally allotted.

The underwriters must buy any of the rump which is left (that is, which they have been unable to sell). These leftover shares are referred to as ‘the stick’. The stick represents the underwriter’s risk. Common for a secondary issue to be sub-underwritten.

#### Underwriting Agreement

Typically includes:

- Details on the commission payable
	- Underwriting costs increase with the length of time for which the underwriter is ‘on risk’ to take up shares.
	- Typically 2-3%.
- Conditions
	- Include passing of necessary resolutions and admission of shares to Official List and Main Market, nil paid.
- Representations and warranties from the company
- MAC clause and force majeure clause
	- Allow the underwriter to terminate the agreement in limited circumstances.
	- Termination rights are being increasingly drafted more precisely.
	- [[Tandrin Aviation Holdings Ltd v Aero Toy Store [2010] EWHC 40 (Comm)]]: extraordinary economic or financial difficulties do not fall within a generally-worded force majeure clause.

Recall that the FCA does not allow shares in listed companies to be allotted provisionally on a conditional basis. So underwriters should not have any right to terminate their underwriting obligation once the nil paid rights have been admitted, because once this point is reached shareholders will begin trading in the rights.

### Pre-emption Rights

A rights issue is a **pre-emptive offer**, that is, it is in accordance with the statutory pre-emption rights on allotment under s 561 of the CA 2006; the company is issuing equity securities (for our purposes, ordinary shares) to holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal value of their existing shareholdings, in return for cash consideration.

As the issue is in accordance with s 561, there is no requirement to disapply s 561; however, the company must also comply with s 562 of the CA 2006, which sets out how to make the offer:

1. must be in hard copy or electronic form (s 562(2));
2. must state a period of not less than 14 days during which it can be accepted (s 562(5)); and
3. such period begins:
	1. for an offer made in hard copy, with the date on which the offer was sent or supplied; or
	2. for an offer made electronically, with the date on which the offer was sent.

Recall that although there is no legal requirement to disapply s 561 for a rights issue, in practice s 561 is often disapplied. If the rights issue requires a new s 551 authority then the existing s 561 disapplication will be of no use.

#### Fractional Entitlements

If the company offered shareholders their exact proportional entitlements under a rights issue, the calculation may entitle some shareholders to fractions of shares. CA 2006 is unclear on how to deal with these, so practically, shareholder entitlements are rounded down to the nearest whole share.

CA 2006 is not clear as to whether fractional entitlements are covered by s 561. Selling the aggregate might infringe the existing shareholders’ pre-emption rights. However, if those pre-emption rights are disapplied, the company can sell the aggregate fractional entitlements.

This is subject to LR 9.5.13R for premium listed companies. If the fractional entitlement for that particular shareholder exceeds £5, the whole entitlement should go to the shareholder.

#### Overseas Shareholders

Japan, Canada and US have super strict laws on offering securities – a company may not want to bother. If the pre-emption rights have not been disapplied and the company has shareholders in those jurisdictions, the company has a problem.

Options:

1. Section 562(3) CA 2006 does provide for this situation; it allows companies to make an offer to those overseas shareholders by way of a notice in the Gazette (known as the ‘ Gazette route’).
2. Disapply the pre-emption rights, and arrange for the entitlements of those shareholders to be aggregated and sold in the market, nil-paid. Any premium the company receives over the subscription price will then usually be given to those overseas shareholders.
	- For premium listed companies this will be done in accordance with LR 9.5.4R (subject to the company’s right to retain amounts under £5 per shareholder if it wishes).

#### Convertible Securities

Suppose:

- A company has issued securities
- The terms of those securities state that they will entitle the holder to pre-emption rights
- But under CA 2006 the holder is not entitled to pre-emption rights

Then the company must disapply s 561 $\implies$ can make the rights issue to these holders in accordance with the terms of the securities.

#### Pre-emption Rights Under LRs

The pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules for premium listed companies are slightly more flexible than the pre-emption rights under the CA 2006.

When the company disapplies s 561, this also disapplies the pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules (LR 9.3.12R). But the company will still offer the rights pre-emptively – to keep the IPCs happy.

#### IPCs

Para 1 of Part 1 of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles makes clear that the Principles do not apply to issues of equity securities on a pre-emptive basis. Paragraph 2 of Part 3 of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles evidences the IPC’s preference for pre-emptive issues.

### Timetable

See textbook.

### Rights Issue Advantages

- Price
	- If the issue is in accordance with LR pre-emption requirements, there is no limit on the level of discount at which the company can issue shares (except > nominal value - s 580)
- IPCs
	- More likely to support pre-emptive method.

#### Rights Issue Disadvantages

- High underwriting cost
- Market value
	- Discounted shares can cause the share price to fall.
	- Timing
		- The offer period is 10 business days under LR 9.5.6R for premium listed companies, or 14 days under CA 2006, s 562(5) for standard listed companies (assuming not disapplied).
		- This cannot run concurrently with the GM notice.
	- Pre-emption
		- A s 561 disapplication is often required, despite the pre-emptive basis.

#### Appropriate?

Key questions:

- Is the company concerned about underwriting costs?
- Does the company need to raise finance quickly?
- Does the company need flexibility in the amount by which it can discount shares?

### Documentation

Potentially need:

- Press announcement of rights issue on impact day and of the results of the issue, issued via an RIS and satisfying the need for an RIS notification (LR 9.5.5R and LR 9.6.6.R for premium listed companies);
- Underwriting agreement
- PAL
- GM notice
- Prospectus
- Separate circular
- Documents required for admitting shares to listing/ trading
- Additional documents if the rights issue involves CREST shareholders.
- Gazette notice for overseas shareholders.

## Open Offer

Appendix 1.1 Listing Rules defines an open offer. This is:

- An offer to issue new shares or transfer existing shares
- To existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.

Offer is usually for cash. Offer is made by an application form rather than a PAL.

### Price

- Shares offered for a discount, but a lower one than a rights issue.
- Open offer for a premium listed company cannot be priced at a discount of $> 10\%$ market value (LR 9.5.10R(1)).
- LR 9.5.10R(3): rules does not apply if:
	- Company's shareholders have specifically approved the terms of the open offer at a discouunt of >10%
	- Shares issued for cash consideration under a pre-existing general authority to disapply s 561.
		- Shares issued under this exception will render the disapplication specific under Pre-Emption Group Statement of Principles, which recommends limiting the discount to 5% unless the issue is in accordance with Listing Rules pre-emption requirements.

### Structure

- Company sends a personal application form to each shareholder.
- Take it or leave it offer.
- Lazy shareholders get nothing.
- Cheaper for companies than rights issues.
- IPCs have informally stated that if an issue represents >15-18% of a company's issued share capital or if the discount is $>7.5\%$, may be cause for concern.

### Timing

- LR 9.5.7R: the timetable for an open offer of a premium listed company must be approved by the RIE on which the shares are traded.
- LR 9.5.7AR: offer period must be $\geq 10$ business days from the date of posting the application forms.
	- Same as a rights offer.
- If a general meeting is required to obtain the consent of the shareholders in connection for the share issue, the offer period can run concurrently with the GM notice.
	- Because unlike a rights issue, the application forms do not provisionally allot shares.

### Advantages

- Timing – offer period and GM notice concurrent.
- Cost – discount on shares cannot be <10% – cheaper for the company.

### Disadvantages

- Pre-emption
	- s 561 disapplication usually required despite the offer being on a pre-emptive basis because statutory pre-emption rights usually cause problems.
- Flexibility
	- May be less attractive to shareholders than a rights issue because the discount is capped.
- IPCs
	- IPCs prefer rights issues generally.

## Placing

```ad-defn
title: Placing (Appendix 1.1 Listing Rules)
- Offer by the company to issue new shares and/ or offer by existing shareholders to transfer existing unlisted shares
- To specified persons or clients of any financial adviser assisting in the placing
- Which does not involve an offer to the public or to existing holders of the company's securities. 
```

### Price

- Paragraph 5 of Part 2B of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles: Paragraph 5 of Part 2B of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles.
- Listing Rule 9.5.10R also provides that for a premium listed company a placing cannot be priced at a discount of more than 10% of market value unless it is structured to fall within either of the exceptions set out at LR 9.5.10R(3)(a) or (b).

### Advantages

Cost:

- Lower underwriting fees
- Limitations on discount (see above)
- Lower underwriting fees (soundings will have been taken from the market).

### Disadvantages

Not pre-emptive:

- s 561 disapplication required.
- Pre-emption Group Statement of Principles will restrict the number of shares which can be issued.

### Documentation

- Press announcement/ RIS notification
- Placing agreement
- Underwriting agreement
- Prospectus, unless placing is exempt
- If placing is exempt, a separate circular
- Other documents required for admission to listing and trading.

## Acquisition Issue

```ad-defn
An issue of new shares by the company to the seller(s) of an asset or assets (which includes shares) in consideration for the acquisition by the company of that asset or assets. Also known as a ‘share-for-share exchange’, or a ‘securities exchange offer’.
```

![[acquisition-issue.png]]

### Advantages

- Timing
- Cost
- Pre-emption
	- The issue is not for cash, so s561 pre-emption rights are **not** triggered.

### Disadvantages

Valuation may be required under s 593 CA 2006 if the asset to be acquired is anything other than shares.

### Documentation

- Press announcement/ RIS notification
- SPA
- Prospectus (unless exempt)
- Circular
- Listing and trading documentation.

## Vendor Placing

Useful in the context of an acquisition, where

- The company wants to make an acquisition
- Company does not have sufficient cash to buy the business
- Seller is not willing to accept non-cash consideration.

```ad-action
title: Structure
- There is an acquisition issue. 
- Company arranges for the investment bank to place the shares issued to the seller as consideration
- Investment bank gives the proceeds of the placing in cash to the seller. 
```

### Price

Listing Rule 9.5.10R: vendor placing for a premium listed company cannot be priced at a discount of more than 10% of market value unless it is structured to fall within either of the exceptions set out at LR 9.5.10R(3)(a) and (b).

The vendor placing is not an issue of shares for cash, so it will not fall within the exception at LR 9.5.10R(3)(b).

### Advantages

- Cost
	- Limitation on the discount that can be applied for a premium listed company.
- Pre-emption
	- Not an issue for cash, so pre-emption rights do not apply.
	- But Investment Association has issued guidelines providing that vendor placings must be placed on a basis which gives existing shareholders the right to claw back their pro rata share of the issue, if the vendor placing comprises:
		- >10% of the company's issued equity share capital; or
		- At >5% discount.
	- Clawback usually offered by way of open offer.

### Disadvantages

s 593 CA 2006 valuation required if the asset acquired is anything but shares.

### Documentation

- Press announcement/ RIS notification
- SPA
- Placing agreement
- Underwriting agreement
- Prospectus (unless exempt)
- Circular
- Listing and trading documentation.
