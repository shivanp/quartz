# Issuing Shares

Once a listed company has created a class of shares, the company will want to use the shares to raise capital. Involves issuing shares to shareholders in return for consideration. Public companies have complex share structures. Listed companies should consider:

- Guidelines issued by the Investment Association
- Statement of Principles by the Pre-Emption Group; and
- Listing Rules.

## Terminology

### Issuing/ Transferring

- On a share issue, the company is party to the transaction and receives money for the share
- On a share transfer, the parties will be the buying and selling shareholders.

### Allotting/ Issuing

- Often used interchangeably.
- s 558 CA 2006: shares are allotted when a person acquires the unconditional right to be included in the company's register of members in respect of those shares
- Case law: shares are issued when the allottee's name is registered in the register of members ([[National Westminster Bank plc and Another v IRC and Barclays Bank plc [1994] 2 BCLC 30]]).

## Key Questions

In relation to an issue of shares, consider;

1. Limit on the number of shares?
2. Authority to allot? (s 551)
3. Pre-emption rights? (s 561).

## Limit of Number of Shares

- Companies formed after 01/10/09 can place a limit on the number of shares which can be issued.
- Companies formed before 01/10/09 were required to have restrictions on the number of shares they could issue (authorised share capital) in their memorandum.
- s 28: provisions automatically treated as restrictions in the articles.

### Checking Articles and Issued Share Capital

- Check articles for any restrictions on the issue (see Companies House)
- Check memorandum for a pre-CA 2006 company
- Check latest statement of capital to find current issued share capital (e.g., the company will have filed a return of allotment Form SH01 within 1 month of the allotment of new shares).
- Ensure these filings are up to date.

### Checking Guidelines

Check whether Investment Association guidelines or Pre-emption Group Statement of Principles have an effect on whether the company can issue new shares.

### Removing Limit

- s 21 CA 2006: company articles can be changed by special resolution.
	- Written resolution under s 288 CA 2006 not available to a public company.
- If there is an existing limit for a company formed before 01/10/09, the limit can be removed:
	1. By ordinary resolution to remove the limit
	2. By special resolution to adopt new articles without a limit
	3. By special resolution amending the articles authorising the directors to allot shares in excess of the limit.
- ss 29 & 30: a copy of the resolution and amended articles must be sent to Companies House within 15 days of the date of the resolution (s 30(1)). Company and every officer liable to a fine if not (s 30(2), (3)).

### Listing Rules

- Premium listed company must publish a circular giving information on the change of articles and the issue of new securities, including arrangements for the allotment.
- FCA approval not required for the circular (LR 13.2.1R).
- LR 13.8.10R; must include:
	- an explanation of the effect of the proposed amendments
	- Full terms of amendments/ statement that they are available for inspection (at a place in/ near the City of London + the place of the GM for $\geq 15$ mins before the meeting).
	- Company must file a copy of the resolution and circular with the NSM and notify an RIS it has done so (LR 9.6.1R, LR 9.6.2R, LR 9.6.3R).
	- Proposed alteration to premium/ standard listed company's capital structure must be notified to an RIS asap (LR 9.6.4R(1), LR 14.3.17R).

## Authority to Allot

### S 551 CA 2006

Prohibits directors from allotting relevant securities unless authorised to do so by

1. Articles
2. Ordinary resolution.

Section 551 applies to:

1. the allotment of any type of share (ordinary and preference) (s 551(1)(a)) other than–
	1. the subscriber shares (s 559), and
	2. shares allotted under an employee share scheme (see 13.9 ) (s 549(2)(a)); and
2. the grant of any right to subscribe for, or convert to, any type of share (s 551(1)(b)) other than under an employee share scheme (s 549(2)(b)).

Effect of s 551(1)(b): brings more than just shares within the ambit of s 551. This includes:

| Instrument                    | Description                                                              | Within s 551?                                                                                                                         | When is authority needed?                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Convertible loan stock        | Class of debt security carrying the right to convert into [[Shares]].    | Yes provided it does not convert to employee share scheme shares.                                                                     | When debt securities are allotted (s 549(3)). |
| Options                       | Option to subscribe for shares (other than employee share scheme shares) | Yes                                                                                                                                   | At the time of the grant of the option.       |
| Convertible preference shares | Share carrying the right to convert into ordinary shares.                | Yes - s 551(1)(a) catches initial allotment of preference shares, s 551(1)(b) catches the right of preference shares to be converted. | When the convertible preference shares are allotted. Authority will need to cover both the convertible preference shares and the ordinary shares they convert into.                                               |

![[s551-flowchart.png]]

```ad-statute
title: s 551 CA 2006 - Power of directors to allot shares etc: authorisation by company

(1) The directors of a company may exercise a power of the company—
- (a) to allot shares in the company, or
- (b) to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the company,

if they are authorised to do so by the company's articles or by resolution of the company.

(2) Authorisation may be given for a particular exercise of the power or for its exercise generally, and may be unconditional or subject to conditions.

(3) Authorisation must—
- (a) state the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under it, and
- (b) specify the date on which it will expire, which must be not more than five years from—
	- (i) in the case of authorisation contained in the company's articles at the time of its original incorporation, the date of that incorporation;
	- (ii) in any other case, the date on which the resolution is passed by virtue of which the authorisation is given.

(4) Authorisation may—
- (a) be renewed or further renewed by resolution of the company for a further period not exceeding five years, and
- (b) be revoked or varied at any time by resolution of the company.

(5) A resolution renewing authorisation must—
- (a) state (or restate) the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under the authorisation or, as the case may be, the amount remaining to be allotted under it, and
- (b) specify the date on which the renewed authorisation will expire.

(6) In relation to rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the company, references in this section to the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under the authorisation are to the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted pursuant to the rights.

(7) The directors may allot shares, or grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares, after authorisation has expired if—
- (a) the shares are allotted, or the rights are granted, in pursuance of an offer or agreement made by the company before the authorisation expired, and
- (b) the authorisation allowed the company to make an offer or agreement which would or might require shares to be allotted, or rights to be granted, after the authorisation had expired.

(8) A resolution of a company to give, vary, revoke or renew authorisation under this section may be an ordinary resolution, even though it amends the company's articles.
```

### Existing S 551 Authority

In particular, check:

- The date on which s 551 authority expires; and
- The maximum amount of relevant securities which can be allotted under it.

### New S 551 Authority

Section 551(8) provides that whether the original authority was given in the articles of association, or by ordinary resolution, it can be renewed by ordinary resolution.

### Resolution

Under s 551(2) of the CA 2006, the authority can be restricted to a specific allotment, or it can be drafted as a general power to allot.

s 551(3) provides that the authority must include two key pieces of information:

1. expiry date;
	- 5 years from either date on which company incorporated/ date of resolution.
	- In practice, listed companies grant directors a new s 551 authority each year at the AGM to comply with Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines.
2. the maximum amount of shares which can be allotted under it.
	- Usually stated as a maximum nominal amount rather than a maximum amount of shares (so it doesn't matter if the company consolidates/ subdivides shares).
	- Maximum amount relates to the shares which will be issued on exercise of the right.
	- Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines impose a limit on this amount.

#### Notify Companies House

- Under s 555 of the CA 2006 the company must file with Companies House within one month a return of the allotment together with a statement of capital (SH01).
- Under s 554, directors must register an allotment as soon as practicable, but no later than two months after the allotment, otherwise an offence will have been committed.
- The lawyer must also ensure that the s 551 ordinary resolution is filed at Companies House within 15 days of it being passed.

### Listing Rules

LR 13.8.1R provides that when a premium listed company sends out the s 551 resolution to its shareholders, the explanatory circular (which does not require approval by the FCA (LR 13.2.1R)) must include the following information:

1. a statement of:
	1. the **maximum amount** of relevant securities which the directors will have authority to allot, and
	2. the **percentage** which that amount represents of the total issued ordinary share capital as at the latest practicable date before publication of the circular;
2. a statement by the directors as to whether they have any **present intention** of exercising the authority, and if so for what **purpose**; and
3. a statement as to whether the authority will **lapse**.

- Must also include info relating to any treasury shares held.
- The company must file a copy of the resolution and circular with the NSM, and notify an RIS that it has done so (LR 9.6.1R, LR 9.6.2R and LR 9.6.3R).

### Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines

The Investment Association Share Capital Management Guidelines provide that the maximum amount of relevant securities for which authority can be given is **one-third** of the issued ordinary share capital.

The Investment Association will accept an authority to allow the allotment of a **further one-third** of the issued share capital, provided that the additional authority is only used for fully pre-emptive rights issues and both the general and additional authorities expire at the next AGM (rather than up to five years for a general authority).

The guidelines are non-statutory – discussion with the Investment Association is possible.

### Sanctions for Breach

Breach of s 551 does not actually invalidate the share allotment (CA 2006, s 549(6)). However, s 549(4) and (5) provide that any director who knowingly and wilfully contravenes, or permits or authorises a contravention of, s 551 is liable to a fine.

## Allotment Pre-emption

```ad-question
Do the pre-emption rights under s 561 apply to the allotment? Does the company need to disapply them?
```

```ad-defn
A pre-emption right on allotment is a right of first refusal for existing shareholders on an issue of shares by a company. When a company wants to issue shares, it must first offer those shares to the existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.
```

The right of pre-emption protects the shareholders against the dilution of their shareholdings. Provisions found in:

- CA 2006
- Listing Rules
- Articles of Association
- Deed of issue of any convertible securities/ options.

### S 561 CA 2006

```ad-statute
title: s 561 CA 2006
(1) A company must not allot equity securities to a person on any terms unless—

- (a) it has made an offer to each person who holds ordinary shares in the company to allot to him on the same or more favourable terms a proportion of those securities that is as nearly as practicable equal to the proportion in nominal value held by him of the ordinary share capital of the company, and

- (b) the period during which any such offer may be accepted has expired or the company has received notice of the acceptance or refusal of every offer so made.

(2) Securities that a company has offered to allot to a holder of ordinary shares may be allotted to him, or anyone in whose favour he has renounced his right to their allotment, without contravening subsection (1)(b).
```

Provides statutory pre-emption rights on allotment. A company proposing to issue equity securities in return for cash must first offer the shares to holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal value of their existing shareholdings.

```ad-defn
title: Equity securities
The shares the company is proposing to issue which might trigger pre-emption rights, so that those equity securities must be offered first to those people who have pre-emption rights; and
```

```ad-defn
title: Ordinary shares 
The shares which entitle their owners to pre-emption rights, so that their owners are offered first refusal over an issue of equity securities.
```

### Equity Securities

```ad-statute
title: s 560(1)
- “equity securities” means—
	- (a) ordinary shares in the company, or
	- (b) rights to subscribe for, or to convert securities into, ordinary shares in the company;
- “ordinary shares” means shares other than shares that as respects dividends and capital carry a right to participate only up to a specified amount in a distribution.
```

So equity securities are:

1. any ‘ordinary shares’ in the company, other than:
	1. a subscriber share (s 577),
	2. a bonus share (s 564),
	3. shares held under an employees’ share scheme (s 566), and
	4. shares allotted pursuant to a right to subscribe (s 549(3)); and
2. any right to subscribe for, or convert securities into, ordinary shares.

![[Equity securities]]

```ad-warning
Under LR 9.3.11R, holders of "equity shares" in a premium-listed company only are entitled to be offered "equity securities" on an issue of "equity securities".  Under the statutory pre-emption right (s561 CA 2006) holders of "ordinary shares" are entitled to be offered "equity securities" on a pre-emptive basis. The Listing Rules definition of "equity securities" however is narrower than the s560 CA 2006 definition of "equity securities" in that it doesn't include rights to subscribe for ordinary shares.
```

### For Cash

Section 565 provides that the pre-emption rights under s 561(1) will apply only if the issue of shares is **wholly** in return for cash. Section 583 of the CA 2006 defines a payment of cash to include cash or cheque.

### Ordinary Shares

Shares that entitle their owners to benefit from pre-emption rights in the event that the company issues equity securities. These have an uncapped element.

#### Right to Subscribe for/ Convert into Ordinary Shares

Falls within the definition of equity securities, but outside the definition of ordinary shares. So the issue of such a right will trigger the pre-emption rights, but those rights to subscribe/ convert will not entitle their owners to pre-emption rights.

- Convertible loan stock
	- Loan stock is an equity security (s 560(1)(b)).
	- Issue of convertible loan stock for cash triggers s 561 pre-emption rights.
- Convertible preference shares
	- If participating, caught by the definition of equity securities (they are ordinary shares) and trigger pre-emption rights if issued for cash.
	- If non-participating, not ordinary shares but caught by (b) $\rightarrow$ issue of shares for cash will trigger pre-emption rights.

#### Employee Share Schemes

```ad-statute
title: s 566 - Exceptions to pre-emption right: employees' share schemes

Section 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption) does not apply to the allotment of equity securities that would, apart from any renunciation or assignment of the right to their allotment, be held under or allotted or transferred pursuant to an employees' share scheme.
```

Employee share scheme shares will not trigger the s 561 pre-emption provisions when they are issued, but, once issued, they will entitle their owners to pre-emption rights in the event that the company issues equity securities.

#### Bonus/ Subscriber Shares

Sections 564 and 577 state that the allotment of bonus/subscriber shares will not trigger pre-emption rights, but holders of bonus and subscriber shares will be entitled to pre-emption rights provided they are ordinary shares and are not excluded because they carry only a limited right to participate in income and share capital.

1. Equity securities which can trigger pre-emption rights when they are issued (that is they must be offered pro rata to the existing shareholders):
	 1. ordinary shares;
	 2. participating preference shares; and
	 3. rights to subscribe for, or convert into, ordinary or participating preference shares.
2. Securities which are not equity securities and cannot trigger pre-emption rights when they are issued:
	 1. non-participating preference shares;
	 2. employee share scheme shares;
	 3. any share issued for non-cash consideration;
	 4. bonus shares; and
	 5. subscriber shares.
3. ‘Ordinary shares’ which entitle their owners to pre-emption rights on an issue of equity securities (in other words, these shareholders will expect a pro rata offer of the equity securities being offered):
	 1. ordinary shares;
	 2. participating preference shares;
	 3. employee share scheme shares (if they are (i) or (ii) above);
	 4. bonus shares (if they are (i) or (ii) above); and
	 5. subscriber shares (if they are (i) or (ii) above).
4. Shares which do not entitle their owners to pre-emption rights on an issue of equity securities (in other words, these shareholders cannot expect a pro rata offer of the equity securities being offered):
	 1. non-participating preference shares;
	 2. rights to subscribe for, or to convert into, ordinary or participating preference shares.

### Pre-emption Rights on Allotment

Premium listed companies only must, in addition to the statutory pre-emption rights, comply with pre-emption rights on allotment (LR 9.3.11R). The Listing Rules rights apply just to premium listed companies. These will usually be UK-registered, but they may also be registered overseas and so not subject to the CA 2006.

```ad-important
On an issue of equity securities for cash, there is a continuing obligation on a premium listed company to offer those shares first to the existing equity shareholders (of shares of that class, or of another class who are entitled to be offered them) in proportion to their existing holdings. 
```

An issue by a premium listed company pursuant to the pre-emption rights set out in LR 9.3.11R is known as a ‘rights issue’ or an ‘open offer’.

Similar but not identical to CA 2006 provisions.

LR 9.3.12R(2) provides that a company does not need to comply with the pre-emption rights in LR 9.3.11R in relation to equity shares which:

- represent fractional entitlements; or
- the directors think it is necessary or expedient to exclude from any offer due to legal problems under the laws of any territory or due to any regulatory body,  
where there is a disapplication in a rights issue or an open offer, used solely in respect of the shares covered by (a) and (b) above, rather than generally for all shares.

LR 9.3.12R(3) and LR 9.3.12R(4) provide that the pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules will not apply if the company is selling treasury shares for cash to an employee share scheme, or if the company is an overseas company with a primary listing.

s 561 says nothing about fractional entitlements, so in practice entitlements are rounded down. To comply with s 561 without making an offer in jurisdictions outside the EEA with onerous requirements, companies must follow the procedure under s 562(3) of the CA 2006, known as the ‘ Gazette route’.

Note that there are no pre-emption rights on transfer in the Listing Rules.

### Disapplication of CA 2006 Pre-emption Rights

Public companies can disapply pre-emption rights under ss 570 and 571 of the CA 2006.

#### Specific Disapplication (s 571)

```ad-statute
title: s 571 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights by special resolution

(1) Where the directors of a company are authorised for the purposes of section 551 (power of directors to allot shares etc: authorisation by company), whether generally or otherwise, the company may by special resolution resolve that section 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption)—
- (a) does not apply to a specified allotment of equity securities to be made pursuant to that authorisation, or
- (b) applies to such an allotment with such modifications as may be specified in the resolution.

(2) Where such a resolution is passed the provisions of this Chapter have effect accordingly.

(3) A special resolution under this section ceases to have effect when the authorisation to which it relates—
- (a) is revoked, or
- (b) would (if not renewed) expire.

But if the authorisation is renewed the resolution may also be renewed, for a period not longer than that for which the authorisation is renewed, by a special resolution of the company.

(4) Notwithstanding that any such resolution has expired, the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of an offer or agreement previously made by the company if the resolution enabled the company to make an offer or agreement that would or might require equity securities to be allotted after it expired.

(5) A special resolution under this section, or a special resolution to renew such a resolution, must not be proposed unless—
- (a) it is recommended by the directors, and
- (b) the directors have complied with the following provisions.

(6) Before such a resolution is proposed, the directors must make a written statement setting out—
- (a) their reasons for making the recommendation,
- (b) the amount to be paid to the company in respect of the equity securities to be allotted, and
- (c) the directors' justification of that amount.

(7) The directors' statement must—
- (a) if the resolution is proposed as a written resolution, be sent or submitted to every eligible member at or before the time at which the proposed resolution is sent or submitted to him;
- (b) if the resolution is proposed at a general meeting, be circulated to the members entitled to notice of the meeting with that notice.
```

A disapplication of pre-emption rights in relation to a specific allotment must be effected by a special resolution. However, this is not a popular method because of the requirements of s 571(5)–(7). This provides that before the resolution is proposed, the directors must recommend that the resolution be passed and circulate a written statement setting out:

1. their reasons for making the recommendation;
2. the amount of consideration for the shares; and
3. the justification of that amount.

The statement must be circulated to the members before the general meeting to pass the special resolution. The directors risk up to 12 months’ imprisonment or a fine if the statement contains anything which is materially misleading, false or deceptive (s 572).

#### General Disapplication (s 570)

The disapplication can be effected either by special resolution, which is most common, or by a provision in the articles. Unlike under s 571, the directors are not required to make any recommendation in relation to the resolution.

```ad-statute
title: s 570 - Disapplication of pre-emption rights: directors acting under general authorisation

(1) Where the directors of a company are generally authorised for the purposes of section 551 (power of directors to allot shares etc: authorisation by company), they may be given power by the articles, or by a special resolution of the company, to allot equity securities pursuant to that authorisation as if section 561 (existing shareholders' right of pre-emption)—
- (a) did not apply to the allotment, or
- (b) applied to the allotment with such modifications as the directors may determine.

(2) Where the directors make an allotment under this section, the provisions of this Chapter have effect accordingly.

(3) The power conferred by this section ceases to have effect when the authorisation to which it relates—
- (a) is revoked, or
- (b) would (if not renewed) expire.

But if the authorisation is renewed the power may also be renewed, for a period not longer than that for which the authorisation is renewed, by a special resolution of the company.

(4) Notwithstanding that the power conferred by this section has expired, the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of an offer or agreement previously made by the company if the power enabled the company to make an offer or agreement that would or might require equity securities to be allotted after it expired.
```

#### Duration

Disapplication only effective until the s 551 authority to which it relates expires (s 570(3)). So the disapplication cannot last $> 5$ years.

#### Notifying Companies House

The company must file a copy of the s 570 (or 571) resolution at Companies House within 15 days of its being passed (s 29(1)(a) and s 30).

### Disapplication Under Listing Rules

- LR 9.3.12R(1): a general disapplication by the shareholders of their statutory pre-emption rights in accordance with s 570 (or 571) of the CA 2006 will also dispense with the pre-emption rights under LR 9.3.11R.
- In practice, most public companies effect a general disapplication of the statutory pre-emption rights at each AGM, at the same time that they take any s 551 authority.
- Even though this dispenses of LR pre-emption rights, many listed companies prefer to state in the resolution that they will nevertheless comply with the pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules.

#### Communication with Shareholders

If the company has a premium listing, it will need to observe the continuing obligations of the Listing Rules relating to communications with shareholders.

Listing Rule 13.8.2R provides that a circular should accompany the s 570 or s 571 disapplication containing the following information:

1. a statement of the maximum amount of equity securities that the disapplication will cover; and
2. (in the case of a general disapplication in respect of equity securities for cash made otherwise than to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings) the percentage which the amount generally disapplied represents of the total ordinary share capital in issue as at the latest practicable date before publication of the circular.

The company must file a copy of the resolution and circular with the NSM, and notify an RIS that it has done so (LR 9.6.2R, LR 9.6.1R and LR 9.6.3R).

### Pre-emption Group's Statement of Principles

Institutional investors do not generally support issues of new shares by listed companies other than by way of a rights issue, because otherwise the issue will dilute a shareholder’s shareholding, resulting in a smaller share of the company’s profit (dividend) and a smaller percentage of voting rights.

Pre-Emption Group members consist of listed companies, investors and intermediaries. The Principles are supported by the PLSA and the Investment Association. They reflect the position that the powerful institutional shareholders will take in relation to any s 570 disapplication.

Paragraph 1 of Part 1 of the Statement: the Principles apply to equity issues for cash, **other than on a pre-emptive basis**, by UK and non-UK companies.

#### General Disapplications

A general disapplication is one sought by a company at an AGM other than for the purpose of an identified, proposed issue of ordinary shares (Part 2A, para 1). While the company needs to explain why the disapplication is required, and notify shareholders of the need for it in good time, shareholders are likely to agree in principle with such requests.

```ad-guid
title: When a general disapplication is likely to be supported by institutional shareholders
1. when the company is seeking authority to issue **non-pre-emptively $\leq 5\%$** issued ordinary share capital in any one year (regardless of the purpose) (Part 2A, para 3);
2. when the company is seeking authority to issue **non-pre-emptively** no more than an **additional 5%** of issued ordinary share capital provided that the company intends to use it only in connection with an **acquisition or specified capital investment** which is announced together with the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding **six-month** period;
3. a company should not issue more than **7.5% of its ordinary share capital for cash**, other than to existing shareholders, in any rolling three year period (excluding a disapplication for an acquisition or specified capital investment or a specific disapplication, unless:
	1. it has consulted suitably in advance, or
	2. the matter was specifically highlighted when the disapplication request was made (Part 2B, para 2); and
4. the price at which the shares are proposed to be issued should be at a **discount** of no more than **5%** (Part 2B, para 5).
```

A disapplication should not be granted for more than 15 months or until the next AGM, whichever is the shorter (Part 2A, para 4).

#### Specific Disapplications

In Part 3, the Principles recognise that some requests to disapply pre-emption rights might be non-general (i.e. ‘specific’) but nevertheless in the interests of the company and its shareholders. Any request for a specific disapplication should be considered by shareholders on a case by case basis.

##### Where

Any specific disapplication should be made at a specially convened GM, unless the company is in a position to provide all the necessary information to shareholders at its AGM, in which case the request can be made at the AGM (Part 2A, para 5).

#### Procedure

The company must communicate with shareholders as soon as possible (Part 1, para 5). Following the granting of a general disapplication, the company should publish in its annual report certain information about the non-pre-emptive issue, such as the level of discount, the amount raised and how it was used (Part 2B, para 9).

### Sanctions for Breach of S 561

A breach of s 561 will not invalidate or cancel an allotment. However, s 563 of the CA 2006 provides that the company and any director who knowingly permitted the breach are jointly and severally liable to compensate any person to whom the shares should have been offered under the pre-emption rights.

## Issuing Shares

Before the shares are issued, also consider:

- Directors' duties
	- s 172 promote success of company
	- s 171 actin in accordance with constitution + only exercise powers for their proper purpose.
- Financial assistance
	- General prohibition on a public company providing financial help to anyone acquiring shares.

### Consideration

Where the issuer of shares is a public company, s 585(1) of the CA 2006 provides that it cannot accept consideration in the form of an undertaking:

- to do work; or
- to perform services.

A public company cannot allot shares as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash, if the consideration is or includes an undertaking which will, or may, be performed more than five years after the date of the allotment (s 587(1)) - “long-term undertaking”.

### Issuing Shares at a Discount

```ad-statute
title: s 580 - Shares not to be allotted at a discount
(1) A company's shares must not be allotted at a discount.

(2) If shares are allotted in contravention of this section, the allottee is liable to pay the company an amount equal to the amount of the discount, with interest at the appropriate rate.
```

Public company: each share (other than a share allotted pursuant to an employee share scheme) must be paid up at least as to one-quarter of its nominal value, together with the whole of any premium paid on it.

Pre-emption Group’s Principles provide that a listed company should not issue any share under s 570 or s 571 disapplication (on a non-pre-emptive basis) at a discount of $>5\%$ of its market value. **Exception**: if the pre-emption requirements of LRs are followed.

### Valuation of Non-cash Consideration

```ad-statute
title: s 593(1)
A public company must not allot shares as fully or partly paid up (as to their nominal value or any premium on them) otherwise than in cash unless—
- (a) the consideration for the allotment has been independently valued in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter,
- (b) the valuer's report has been made to the company during the six months immediately preceding the allotment of the shares, and
- (c) a copy of the report has been sent to the proposed allottee.
```

One important exception relates to a ‘share-for-share exchange’, that is, when the consideration for the issue of shares by one company is shares in another company. In this case, no valuation is required (s 594).

### Class Rights

Check that the issue will not vary any existing class rights.

### Prospectus Regulation

Analyse the terms of the share issue to check whether a prospectus is required.

### Filing Details

Notify the Registrar of any allotment of shares within one month of the allotment, by completing and delivering Form SH01 to Companies House. Note that the form must include a brief description of the consideration for which the shares were allotted.

# Disclosure of Interests in Shares

## Other Requirements

### PDMR and PCA Transactions

UK MAR, Article 19 requires PDMRs and persons closely associated (PCAs) to disclose to the company and to the FCA all transactions conducted on their own account in the shares of the company (or derivatives or any other financial instruments relating to those shares). This must be done promptly and no later than three business days after the transaction (UK MAR, Article 19(1)). The PDMR or PCA must include in the disclosure the information required by UK MAR, Article 19(6).

A listed company must then make that information public by notifying an RIS of the information it receives under UK MAR, Article 19(1) (UK MAR, Article 19(3)). The company must provide the information to the RIS promptly and no later than three business days after the transaction (UK MAR, Article 19(3)). A template form for both notifications is annexed to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/523 and contains the information required by UK MAR, Article 19(6).

### Directors' Interests in Shares

Listing Rules 9.8.6R(1) requires a statement, setting out the directors’ holdings of shares in their premium listed company, to be included in the annual report, together with any changes to this information over the past year.

# Equity Finance

A company seeking to float can do so in a number of ways:

- Public offer
- Placing
- Introduction
- Intermediaries offer

Equity finance involves using equity securities (e.g., shares) to raise finance.

```ad-note
title: Terminology
- A secondary issue can refer to a subsequent issue of shares by the company following an IPO
- Also refers to a transfer by a shareholder of existing shares. 
```

## Purpose

Reasons for raising equity finance:

- Paying off debt
- Buying something
- Improving bank balance
- Gearing concerns

## Regulations

- MAR 17 general disclosure obligation
- Listing Rules continuing obligations
- Corporate governance, misleading statements, market manipulation, market abuse, insider dealing.

### Admitting Shares to Listing and Trading

- Company cannot choose to list only part of a class of shares.
- If a listed company proposes to issue more shares of a class already listed, must seek admission to listing on Official List and admission to trading on Main Market.
- Under the Listing Rules, the on-the-day documents differ on a secondary issue to those required for an IPO: a Pricing Statement, rather than Shareholder Statement signed by the sponsor, is required (LR 3.3.3R).
- Under the Admission and Disclosure Standards, the application for admission to trading (Form 1) should be submitted with other 2-day documents, rather than 10 days in advance.
- In the context of a rights issue, once shares have been admitted to listing and trading nil paid, no further application is required to admit them fully paid.

## Documentation

### Prospectus

An FCA-approved prospectus is required if a company wishes to

- Offer securities to the public in the UK (Art 3(1) UK Prospectus Regulation)
- Request admission of transferable securities to trading on a regulated market situated or operating in the UK (Art 3(3))

Art 1(4) UK Prospectus Regulation set out exemptions where an offer to the public will not require a prospectus. Art 1(5) UK Prospectus Regulation sets out when an admission to trading will not require a prospectus.

#### Full Prospectus

2 possibilities regarding the content of a prospectus:

- Full prospectus required for an IPO
	- Contents prescribed by UK PR Regulation annexes.
- Secondary issues
	- Annexes 1, 11, 20

#### Simplified Disclosure Prospectus

- UK Prospectus Regulation simplified disclosure regime: Art 14.
- Applies to a company whose shares have been admitted to trading on a UK regulated market continuously for $\geq 18$ months and is issuing further shares of the same type.
- Must include information set out in Annexes 3, 13, 20.
- Company eligible to use the simplified procedure may decide to produce a full prospectus anyway.

#### Supplementary Prospectus

- Supplementary prospectus required if there is material new information/ material mistake etc.
- Triggers statutory withdrawal rights (Art 23(2)) - i.e., investors who have already subscribed can back out.

#### Exemptions

Exemptions may apply on a secondary issue which mean a prospectus is not required.

![[equity-fin-prospectus.png]]

### Circular

- DTRs require a listed company to communicate to shareholders by way of circular on a new issue.
- Often the requirement for the circular is met by the prospectus.
- But separate sometimes for overseas shareholders.

### Other Documentation

- Any new issue of listed securities must be notified to an RIS under specific disclosure requirements.
- SPA if the company is issuing shares as consideration for the acquisition of a non-cash asset.
- Underwriting agreement if the issue is underwritten.
- Placing agreement if there is a placing.

## Methods

Main methods:

1. Rights issue
2. Open offer
3. Placing
4. Acquisition issue
5. Vendor consideration placing.

On an IPO, multiple methods are usually combined.

## Rights Issue

```ad-defn
Defined in Appendix 1.1 LR:
- an offer to issue new shares or transfer existing shares (or other securities);
- to existing shareholders (or security holders) in proportion to their existing holdings;
- made by way of the issue of a renounceable letter;
- which may be traded ‘nil paid’ for a period before payment for the shares (or other securities) is due.
```

Aim: to raise capital through the issue of new shares.

### Price

- Usually allotted for cash at a discount to the market price.
- Current market practice: making a “deep-discount rights issue” $\rightarrow$ less need for underwriting, shares more attractive.
- Note that as long as the price exceeds the nominal value of the share (CA 2006, s 580), there is no legal limit to the discount at which the company can sell the shares.
- The Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles does not apply if the company observes the pre-emption requirements of the Listing Rules.

### Structure

The offer to shareholders is made by renounceable letter (provisional allotment letter – PAL). Provisionally allots to the shareholder her pro rata entitlement of shares.

- The company has given the shareholder a document which sets out her right to buy the new shares.
- The PAL will provide details of the rights issue, including the number of shares to which the shareholder is entitled and the price of those shares.
- The PAL is a temporary document of title, and as such it must comply with the requirements of LR 9.5.15R for a premium listed company and LR 14.3.9R requirements for a standard listed company.

On receiving the PAL, the shareholder can:

1. Take up the rights by subscribing for the shares
	- Submit consideration and the PAL to the company's receiving agents.
	- Ensures shareholder's existing % shareholding is not diluted.
2. Renounce the rights and sell them to a third party, nil paid
	- Shareholder may incur an immediate capital gains tax charge if she sells her rights.
	- Shareholder wishing to renounce and sell rights shouldn't find it difficult to find a buyer.
	- Risk to buyer: market price dropping .
3. Take up some rights and renounce the rest
	- May be used where the shareholder has insufficient funds to buy the whole allocation or does not wish to take up all her rights.
	- The proceeds received from trading some of the rights may help to finance the purchase of the balance of these rights (known as ‘tail swallowing’).
4. Do nothing.
	- “Lazy shareholders”
	- Even lazy shareholders can benefit from a rights issue, because arrangements are made for the sale of any shares not taken up.
	- Lazy shareholder may still receive a cash payment to the extent the shares which were provisionally allotted are sold in the market for more than their subscription price.
	- For premium listed companies only, the proceeds must exceed £5 (LR 9.5.4R).

#### Nil Paid Dealings

- PAL is negotiable (= can be transferred by delivery).
- Offer must be open for $\geq 14$ days
- Nil paid dealings can take place during 14 day period.
	- A shareholder can trade the rights to subscribe simply by signing the PAL and passing it on to someone else.
	- These dealings are referred to as ‘nil paid dealings’ because trading takes place before any subscription monies have been paid for the shares represented by the PAL.
- Then the third party can exercise the right to subscribe in the normal way.
- It is on the admission of the shares to trading in nil paid form that the FCA will grant admission of the shares to the Official List (LR 9.5.3G).

### Timing

The FCA does not allow shares in listed companies to be allotted provisionally on a conditional basis (LR 2.1.5G). This means the PALs can be posted only after all necessary shareholder approvals have been obtained at the GM.

#### Premium Listed Company

- Once the PALs are posted, LR 9.5.6R provides that the offer must remain open for at least 10 business days.
	- The first business day will be the first day the rights issue offer is open for acceptance. This will be the day of the posting of the PAL.
- Section 562(5) states that the offer must be open for 14 days.
	- This section will only be relevant if s 561 is not disapplied.
	- The first day is counted from the day of making the offer. This therefore starts from the day of posting the PAL.
- N.B. 10 business days could be longer than 14 days depending on public holidays.

```ad-tip
A standard listed company is only subject to the requirements of the CA 2006, including s 562(5) above.
```

### Underwriting

The underwriters (usually an investment bank or a broker) basically guarantee that the company will receive the equity finance it seeks, by agreeing to take up, at no less than the subscription price under the rights issue, any shares which are not taken up by shareholders and which cannot be sold in the market – including fractional entitlements if s 561 has been disapplied.

```ad-defn
These shares are referred to as ‘the rump’.
```

Any premium received over the subscription price must be given to the person to whom the shares were provisionally allotted.

The underwriters must buy any of the rump which is left (that is, which they have been unable to sell). These leftover shares are referred to as ‘the stick’. The stick represents the underwriter’s risk. Common for a secondary issue to be sub-underwritten.

#### Underwriting Agreement

Typically includes:

- Details on the commission payable
	- Underwriting costs increase with the length of time for which the underwriter is ‘on risk’ to take up shares.
	- Typically 2-3%.
- Conditions
	- Include passing of necessary resolutions and admission of shares to Official List and Main Market, nil paid.
- Representations and warranties from the company
- MAC clause and force majeure clause
	- Allow the underwriter to terminate the agreement in limited circumstances.
	- Termination rights are being increasingly drafted more precisely.
	- [[Tandrin Aviation Holdings Ltd v Aero Toy Store [2010] EWHC 40 (Comm)]]: extraordinary economic or financial difficulties do not fall within a generally-worded force majeure clause.

Recall that the FCA does not allow shares in listed companies to be allotted provisionally on a conditional basis. So underwriters should not have any right to terminate their underwriting obligation once the nil paid rights have been admitted, because once this point is reached shareholders will begin trading in the rights.

### Pre-emption Rights

A rights issue is a **pre-emptive offer**, that is, it is in accordance with the statutory pre-emption rights on allotment under s 561 of the CA 2006; the company is issuing equity securities (for our purposes, ordinary shares) to holders of ordinary shares in proportion to the nominal value of their existing shareholdings, in return for cash consideration.

As the issue is in accordance with s 561, there is no requirement to disapply s 561; however, the company must also comply with s 562 of the CA 2006, which sets out how to make the offer:

1. must be in hard copy or electronic form (s 562(2));
2. must state a period of not less than 14 days during which it can be accepted (s 562(5)); and
3. such period begins:
	1. for an offer made in hard copy, with the date on which the offer was sent or supplied; or
	2. for an offer made electronically, with the date on which the offer was sent.

Recall that although there is no legal requirement to disapply s 561 for a rights issue, in practice s 561 is often disapplied. If the rights issue requires a new s 551 authority then the existing s 561 disapplication will be of no use.

#### Fractional Entitlements

If the company offered shareholders their exact proportional entitlements under a rights issue, the calculation may entitle some shareholders to fractions of shares. CA 2006 is unclear on how to deal with these, so practically, shareholder entitlements are rounded down to the nearest whole share.

CA 2006 is not clear as to whether fractional entitlements are covered by s 561. Selling the aggregate might infringe the existing shareholders’ pre-emption rights. However, if those pre-emption rights are disapplied, the company can sell the aggregate fractional entitlements.

This is subject to LR 9.5.13R for premium listed companies. If the fractional entitlement for that particular shareholder exceeds £5, the whole entitlement should go to the shareholder.

#### Overseas Shareholders

Japan, Canada and US have super strict laws on offering securities – a company may not want to bother. If the pre-emption rights have not been disapplied and the company has shareholders in those jurisdictions, the company has a problem.

Options:

1. Section 562(3) CA 2006 does provide for this situation; it allows companies to make an offer to those overseas shareholders by way of a notice in the Gazette (known as the ‘ Gazette route’).
2. Disapply the pre-emption rights, and arrange for the entitlements of those shareholders to be aggregated and sold in the market, nil-paid. Any premium the company receives over the subscription price will then usually be given to those overseas shareholders.
	- For premium listed companies this will be done in accordance with LR 9.5.4R (subject to the company’s right to retain amounts under £5 per shareholder if it wishes).

#### Convertible Securities

Suppose:

- A company has issued securities
- The terms of those securities state that they will entitle the holder to pre-emption rights
- But under CA 2006 the holder is not entitled to pre-emption rights

Then the company must disapply s 561 $\implies$ can make the rights issue to these holders in accordance with the terms of the securities.

#### Pre-emption Rights Under LRs

The pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules for premium listed companies are slightly more flexible than the pre-emption rights under the CA 2006.

When the company disapplies s 561, this also disapplies the pre-emption rights under the Listing Rules (LR 9.3.12R). But the company will still offer the rights pre-emptively – to keep the IPCs happy.

#### IPCs

Para 1 of Part 1 of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles makes clear that the Principles do not apply to issues of equity securities on a pre-emptive basis. Paragraph 2 of Part 3 of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles evidences the IPC’s preference for pre-emptive issues.

### Timetable

See textbook.

### Rights Issue Advantages

- Price
	- If the issue is in accordance with LR pre-emption requirements, there is no limit on the level of discount at which the company can issue shares (except > nominal value - s 580)
- IPCs
	- More likely to support pre-emptive method.

#### Rights Issue Disadvantages

- High underwriting cost
- Market value
	- Discounted shares can cause the share price to fall.
	- Timing
		- The offer period is 10 business days under LR 9.5.6R for premium listed companies, or 14 days under CA 2006, s 562(5) for standard listed companies (assuming not disapplied).
		- This cannot run concurrently with the GM notice.
	- Pre-emption
		- A s 561 disapplication is often required, despite the pre-emptive basis.

#### Appropriate?

Key questions:

- Is the company concerned about underwriting costs?
- Does the company need to raise finance quickly?
- Does the company need flexibility in the amount by which it can discount shares?

### Documentation

Potentially need:

- Press announcement of rights issue on impact day and of the results of the issue, issued via an RIS and satisfying the need for an RIS notification (LR 9.5.5R and LR 9.6.6.R for premium listed companies);
- Underwriting agreement
- PAL
- GM notice
- Prospectus
- Separate circular
- Documents required for admitting shares to listing/ trading
- Additional documents if the rights issue involves CREST shareholders.
- Gazette notice for overseas shareholders.

## Open Offer

Appendix 1.1 Listing Rules defines an open offer. This is:

- An offer to issue new shares or transfer existing shares
- To existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.

Offer is usually for cash. Offer is made by an application form rather than a PAL.

### Price

- Shares offered for a discount, but a lower one than a rights issue.
- Open offer for a premium listed company cannot be priced at a discount of $> 10\%$ market value (LR 9.5.10R(1)).
- LR 9.5.10R(3): rules does not apply if:
	- Company's shareholders have specifically approved the terms of the open offer at a discouunt of >10%
	- Shares issued for cash consideration under a pre-existing general authority to disapply s 561.
		- Shares issued under this exception will render the disapplication specific under Pre-Emption Group Statement of Principles, which recommends limiting the discount to 5% unless the issue is in accordance with Listing Rules pre-emption requirements.

### Structure

- Company sends a personal application form to each shareholder.
- Take it or leave it offer.
- Lazy shareholders get nothing.
- Cheaper for companies than rights issues.
- IPCs have informally stated that if an issue represents >15-18% of a company's issued share capital or if the discount is $>7.5\%$, may be cause for concern.

### Timing

- LR 9.5.7R: the timetable for an open offer of a premium listed company must be approved by the RIE on which the shares are traded.
- LR 9.5.7AR: offer period must be $\geq 10$ business days from the date of posting the application forms.
	- Same as a rights offer.
- If a general meeting is required to obtain the consent of the shareholders in connection for the share issue, the offer period can run concurrently with the GM notice.
	- Because unlike a rights issue, the application forms do not provisionally allot shares.

### Advantages

- Timing – offer period and GM notice concurrent.
- Cost – discount on shares cannot be <10% – cheaper for the company.

### Disadvantages

- Pre-emption
	- s 561 disapplication usually required despite the offer being on a pre-emptive basis because statutory pre-emption rights usually cause problems.
- Flexibility
	- May be less attractive to shareholders than a rights issue because the discount is capped.
- IPCs
	- IPCs prefer rights issues generally.

## Placing

```ad-defn
title: Placing (Appendix 1.1 Listing Rules)
- Offer by the company to issue new shares and/ or offer by existing shareholders to transfer existing unlisted shares
- To specified persons or clients of any financial adviser assisting in the placing
- Which does not involve an offer to the public or to existing holders of the company's securities. 
```

### Price

- Paragraph 5 of Part 2B of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles: Paragraph 5 of Part 2B of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles.
- Listing Rule 9.5.10R also provides that for a premium listed company a placing cannot be priced at a discount of more than 10% of market value unless it is structured to fall within either of the exceptions set out at LR 9.5.10R(3)(a) or (b).

### Advantages

Cost:

- Lower underwriting fees
- Limitations on discount (see above)
- Lower underwriting fees (soundings will have been taken from the market).

### Disadvantages

Not pre-emptive:

- s 561 disapplication required.
- Pre-emption Group Statement of Principles will restrict the number of shares which can be issued.

### Documentation

- Press announcement/ RIS notification
- Placing agreement
- Underwriting agreement
- Prospectus, unless placing is exempt
- If placing is exempt, a separate circular
- Other documents required for admission to listing and trading.

## Acquisition Issue

```ad-defn
An issue of new shares by the company to the seller(s) of an asset or assets (which includes shares) in consideration for the acquisition by the company of that asset or assets. Also known as a ‘share-for-share exchange’, or a ‘securities exchange offer’.
```

![[acquisition-issue.png]]

### Advantages

- Timing
- Cost
- Pre-emption
	- The issue is not for cash, so s561 pre-emption rights are **not** triggered.

### Disadvantages

Valuation may be required under s 593 CA 2006 if the asset to be acquired is anything other than shares.

### Documentation

- Press announcement/ RIS notification
- SPA
- Prospectus (unless exempt)
- Circular
- Listing and trading documentation.

## Vendor Placing

Useful in the context of an acquisition, where

- The company wants to make an acquisition
- Company does not have sufficient cash to buy the business
- Seller is not willing to accept non-cash consideration.

```ad-action
title: Structure
- There is an acquisition issue. 
- Company arranges for the investment bank to place the shares issued to the seller as consideration
- Investment bank gives the proceeds of the placing in cash to the seller. 
```

### Price

Listing Rule 9.5.10R: vendor placing for a premium listed company cannot be priced at a discount of more than 10% of market value unless it is structured to fall within either of the exceptions set out at LR 9.5.10R(3)(a) and (b).

The vendor placing is not an issue of shares for cash, so it will not fall within the exception at LR 9.5.10R(3)(b).

### Advantages

- Cost
	- Limitation on the discount that can be applied for a premium listed company.
- Pre-emption
	- Not an issue for cash, so pre-emption rights do not apply.
	- But Investment Association has issued guidelines providing that vendor placings must be placed on a basis which gives existing shareholders the right to claw back their pro rata share of the issue, if the vendor placing comprises:
		- >10% of the company's issued equity share capital; or
		- At >5% discount.
	- Clawback usually offered by way of open offer.

### Disadvantages

s 593 CA 2006 valuation required if the asset acquired is anything but shares.

### Documentation

- Press announcement/ RIS notification
- SPA
- Placing agreement
- Underwriting agreement
- Prospectus (unless exempt)
- Circular
- Listing and trading documentation.
