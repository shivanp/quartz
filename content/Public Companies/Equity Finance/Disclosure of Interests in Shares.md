# Disclosure of Interests in Shares

## Other Requirements

### PDMR and PCA Transactions

UK MAR, Article 19 requires PDMRs and persons closely associated (PCAs) to disclose to the company and to the FCA all transactions conducted on their own account in the shares of the company (or derivatives or any other financial instruments relating to those shares). This must be done promptly and no later than three business days after the transaction (UK MAR, Article 19(1)). The PDMR or PCA must include in the disclosure the information required by UK MAR, Article 19(6).

A listed company must then make that information public by notifying an RIS of the information it receives under UK MAR, Article 19(1) (UK MAR, Article 19(3)). The company must provide the information to the RIS promptly and no later than three business days after the transaction (UK MAR, Article 19(3)). A template form for both notifications is annexed to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/523 and contains the information required by UK MAR, Article 19(6).

### Directors' Interests in Shares

Listing Rules 9.8.6R(1) requires a statement, setting out the directorsâ€™ holdings of shares in their premium listed company, to be included in the annual report, together with any changes to this information over the past year.
