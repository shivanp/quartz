# Takeovers

Key differences from private M&A:

- Direct negotiation with shareholders not feasible
- Offer document sent to shareholders, form of acceptance specified, possible compulsory purchase of minority who do not accept.
- Could be unfair to shareholders or the target
	- Target may remain under siege for a long time
	- Some shareholders may be offered a better price.
- So regulated by Takeover Code.
	- Fairness to shareholders
	- Orderly framework.
	- Applies to
		- all takeover offers, and
		- all transactions which have as their aim/ likely outcome the obtaining or consolidating of control of the target
			- Control means 30% voting control
	- Key provisions
		- All of the same class must be given the same treatment
		- Enough time to consider
		- Directors can't deny shareholders the opportunity to consider merits
		- Offeror must be able to fulfil cash consideration offered
		- Target not hindered for longer than possible
	- Statutory effect under CA 2006.
	- Takeover Panel supervises.
	- Rules interpreted purposively – must follow the spirit as well as the letter of the Code.
	- Almost all appeals dealt with by the internal committees.
	- Bidders: offerors
	- Bids are sometimes referred to as mergers – distinct to CA Part 27 specialist merger.

## Recommended Offer

- Can be achieved by contractual offer or CA scheme of arrangement
- Scheme of arrangement preferred
	- Target applies to court for a scheme under which the shares are transferred to the bidder.
- Takeover Code applies to schemes, subject to modifications.

## Stakebuilding Before an Offer

- Reduces overall cost of bid
- Consequences
	- Prohibition of purchase
	- Disclosure of purchase
	- Restrictions on purchase
	- Impact on terms of offer.

### General Considerations

- Insider dealing/ market abuse – is purchase prohibited?
	- Proposed bid likely to be inside info
	- Market information defence or MAR 9 legitimate behaviour may apply
	- Rule 4 TOC
- Listing Rules (bidder) – is shareholder approval required for the purchase?
	- LR 10 significant transaction – class 1?
	- LR 11 – related party transaction?
- Disclosure – potential tactical advantage?
	- DTR 5 – person holding >3% of a company's shares must notify the company of that holding.
		- And any changes + changes of 1% higher notified
		- RIS notification.
		- Could limit benefit of building up a secret stake.
- Mandatory notification of certain interests in sensitive areas of the economy
	- NSA 2021–17 defined areas.
- Compulsory purchase of minority: will purchase make this harder to achieve?
	- Shares bought before the offer period do not count towards acceptance threshold of 90% of “shares to which the offer relates”.

### Takeover Code Considerations

- Terms of the offer
	- Rule 6: min level of consideration
		- Bidder acquires shares within 3 months before – then offer must not be on less favourable terms than the purchase.
		- Increase bid accordingly if this changes.
	- Rule 9: mandatory offer must be in cash/ accompanies by cash alternative
		- Target shareholders must be offered cash as an alternative to shares in a share-for-share offer.
	- Rule 11: nature of consideration
		- If bidder acquires for cash $\geq 10\%$ of shares during offer period or 12 months before, offer must be in cash or include a cash alternative at a price not less than this price.
		- Any offer for cash during the offer period - cash + not less than this price.
	- Rule 16: no special deals.
		- Special deals with target shareholders prohibited without the consent of the panel.
	- Rule 5: restrictions on acquiring 30% or more
		- Bidder prohibited from obtaining control of target without making a full offer to all shareholders
		- Threshold set at 30%
		- Cannot acquire shares if it would take you over 30%
		- May result in an obligation to make a mandatory offer.
	- Rule 9: mandatory offer cannot be subject to conditions, other than acceptance condition.
		- Acceptance usually set at 90%
	- Concert parties
		- Provisions usually apply to advisers etc.
	- Irrevocable undertakings
		- Very useful

## Timetable

### General Considerations

- Shareholders must be given time to consider offer
- Target must not be hindered in conduct of its affairs for longer than reasonable.
- Result: fixed timetable
	- Subject to possible suspension for necessary approvals.
	- Rules modified for schemes of arrangement.

### Contractual Offer

- Day 0 to day 60
- Offer period begins where announcement is made of a firm intention to make an offer.
- Announcement of a possible offer is distinct.
- Rule 2.7 announcement.
