# Public Companies

## Introduction

- 4.3m companies in E&W
- 5,300 public companies
- 1,600 floated on LSE
	- 910 listed on the Main Market
	- 700 quoted on AIM

### Definitions

> [!statute] s 4(2) CA 2006
> A “public company” is a company limited by shares or limited by guarantee and having a share capital—
> - (a) whose certificate of incorporation states that it is a public company, and
> - (b) in relation to which the requirements of this Act, or the former Companies Acts, as to registration or re-registration as a public company have been complied with on or after the relevant date.

Broadly, a listed company is a public company, any of the shares of which are officially listed and trade on a stock market.

In the UK there are two competitor stock markets to the London Stock Exchange, AQSE and Cboe Europe Equities.

> [!warning]
> The s 385 CA 2006 definition of ‘quoted company’ is different to companies listed on ‘regulated markets’ including the Main Market (and, e.g., NYSE) but not AIM.
> 
> 

Here, "listed" means admitted to listing on the FCA Official List and admitted to trading on the Main Market.

A company must be public to be listed.

### Public Company Advantages

#### Ability to Offer Shares to the Public

- s 755 CA 2006: private companies are prohibited from offering shares to the public.
- Offering shares to the public provides a new source of finance.
- If s 755 is breached the court has the power to re-register the offending private company as a public one under s 758 of the CA 2006.
- But if the company does not meet public company requirements,
	- the court may order it to be wound up (s 758) or
	- the court may make a remedial order under s 759 (seeking to put a person back in the position they were in before the breach). Application to court can be made by shareholder/ creditor/ SoS for BEIS.

#### Prestige

PLC – public limited company – sounds legit. Lots of property investment companies are PLCs for this reason.

### Public Company Disadvantages

Regulation. The public members have greater statutory protection than owners of a private company, who are typically more involved in the running of the business (e.g., as directors). Adds to costs of running the company.

### Listing Advantages

1. Provides a market for the company's shares
	- Shares are relatively liquid
	- Can allow proprietors/ VC investors/ private equity investors to sell shares and exit company, reaping the rewards of their investment.
2. Easier access to capital
	- Company can raise finance quickly through issuing new shares
3. Access to acquisition opportunities
	- More access to cash & ability to offer shares means it can expand through acquisitions of other companies.
4. Prestige
	- Public companies must go through a rigorous process to receive regulatory approval.
5. Profile
	- More press coverage
	- Analysts' reports
6. Employee incentives
	- Can offer employees share ownership schemes.
	- Private companies can also do this, but public company shares have an identifiable value.
7. Increasing efficiency
	- Complying with regulatory requirements can make the company better.

### Listing Disadvantages

### Increased Regulatory Regime

- Listed companies face even more onerous requirements than unlisted public companies.
- Higher costs, admin burden, restrictions on the company's actions.
- The Prospectus Regulation Rules, the Listing Rules, the Transparency Rules and the Corporate Governance Rules, originally introduced or amended in response to EU legislation, still apply even after Brexit to any listed company, as do the Market Abuse Regulation and the Prospectus Regulation.
- Statutory provisions
	- **CA 2006** includes provisions applying to listed companies only (e.g., s 420: the directors of a listed company are required to prepare a remuneration report on their pay, bonuses, share options and other related matters for inclusion in the company’s Annual Report).
	- **FSMA 2000**. The penalties for market abuse committed in breach of the Market Abuse Regulation are set out in Pt VIII
	- **CJA 1993**. Part V: insider dealing is a criminal offence.

#### External Forces

Market conditions, rumours, developments in a market sector etc. can all affect the share price. This can have a negative effect on the company's ability to borrow.

#### Increased Shareholder Power

Decrease in management's level of control over the company. Risk that management focuses on short-term growth rather than long-term performance. Risk that shareholders will sell to unwelcome buyers.

#### Loss of Privacy

Decisions of management subject to much greater scrutiny. Can be unwelcome if the company is struggling.

#### Cost and Time

Cost and time associated with listing, raising equity finance, complying with continuing obligations of a listed company and maintaining good investor relations.

#### De-listing

Sometimes companies de-list, deciding that a low share price and low trading volume means the costs and regulations are not worth it.

## Becoming a Public Company

A company can achieve public company status in two ways:

1. registering as a public company on original incorporation; or
2. registering as a private company on original incorporation then re-registering as a public company.

> [!statute] s 9 CA 2006 - Registration documents
> 
> (1) The memorandum of association must be delivered to the registrar together with an application for registration of the company, the documents required by this section and a statement of compliance.
> 
> (2) The application for registration must state—
> - (a) the company's proposed name,
> - (b) whether the company's registered office is to be situated in England and Wales (or in Wales), in Scotland or in Northern Ireland,
> - (c) whether the liability of the members of the company is to be limited, and if so whether it is to be limited by shares or by guarantee, and
> - (d) whether the company is to be a private or a public company.
> 
> (3) If the application is delivered by a person as agent for the subscribers to the memorandum of association, it must state his name and address.
> 
> (4) The application must contain—
> - (a) in the case of a company that is to have a share capital, a statement of capital and initial shareholdings (see section 10);
> - (b) in the case of a company that is to be limited by guarantee, a statement of guarantee (see section 11);
> - (c) a statement of the company's proposed officers (see section 12);
> - (d) a statement of initial significant control (see section 12A).
> 
> (5) The application must also contain—
> - (a) a statement of the intended address of the company's registered office;
> - (b) a copy of any proposed articles of association (to the extent that these are not supplied by the default application of model articles: see section 20); and
> - (c) a statement of the type of company it is to be and its intended principal business activities.

To register as a public company on original incorporation, there are additional requirements:

1. Articles.
	- The articles must be in a form suitable for a public company.
	- Under s 20 of the CA 2006, on registration of a public company a default set of model articles will apply, save to the extent that they are excluded or modified.
	- These public company model articles can be found in Sch 3 to the Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/3229).
2. Name.
	- The company name must end with ‘public limited company’ or the Welsh equivalent (CA 2006, s 58), or with the abbreviation ‘plc’ or its Welsh equivalent ‘ccc’ (CA 2006, s 58(2)).
3. Allotted share capital.
	- The allotted share capital of the company must be not less than the ‘authorised minimum’ (CA 2006, s 761(2)).
	- Currently the authorised minimum is £50,000 (CA 2006, s 763).
	- In addition, each share allotted must be paid up to **at least one-quarter of its nominal value together with the whole of any premium on it** (CA 2006, s 586).

### Certificate of Incorporation

The company will then receive a certificate from the Registrar that the company has been registered as a public company on original incorporation. Although this certificate of incorporation will prove that the public company exists (CA 2006, s 15(1)), and details of the company will now be recorded at Companies House, the public company needs to obtain one other certificate before it can commence business – a trading certificate.

### Trading Certificate

A trading certificate is issued under s 761 CA 2006, confirming that the company has met the allotted share capital requirements. To obtain this certificate, an application must be made (accompanied by a statement of compliance) to the Registrar under s 762 of the CA 2006.

> [!example]
> If 50,000 £1 shares are allotted at nominal value, the minimum consideration which must be paid to the company is £12,500. 

### Re-registration

ss 90-96. The company must pass a special (or written) resolution, meet the specified conditions and submit an application in a prescribed form to the Registrar (s 90(1)).

#### Resolution

The special resolution (which can be written) must:

1. Approve the re-registration of the company (s 90(1)(a))
2. Alter the company name, so it is in a form suitable for a public company. Section 58(1): the name must end with ‘public limited company’ or ‘plc’
3. Alter the articles so that they are in a form suitable for a public company. Often easier to adopt an entirely new set of articles. If the company is to be listed, the Articles will often be entirely bespoke ("long-form articles").

#### Share Capital Requirements

At the time the shareholders pass the special resolution, the company must have satisfied certain conditions as to its share capital, namely that

1. the company must have allotted shares at least up to the value of the authorised minimum (s 91(1)(a)), which is currently £50,000 (CA 2006, s 763) or the euro equivalent, currently €57,100, and
2. that each allotted share must be paid up to at least one-quarter of its nominal value together with the whole of any premium on it (s 91(1)(b)).

> [!note]
> A trading certificate is not required for a public company which re-registers as a public company. 

#### Application for Re-registration

- Special resolution delivered to the Registrar together with an application for re-registration on Form RR01, which has been signed by a director, the company secretary or a person authorised by the directors under s 270 or s 274.
- If the company does not have a company secretary, one must be appointed and details given on the application (s 271)
- Fee for re-registration (£20, plus £10 for any change of name – though the change of name fee is not required to turn ltd to plc).
- Documentation
	- The revised articles (s 94(2)(b));
	- A balance sheet prepared not more than seven months before the application, containing an unqualified report by the company’s auditors (s 94(2)(c), s 92(1)).
		- End of year balance sheet suffices if this is within this 7 month period, else an interim balance sheet must be prepared.
		- Auditors must also provide a written statement regarding the level of the company's company’s net assets in comparison to the company’s called-up share capital and undistributable reserves (s 92(1)(c));
	- A valuation report on any shares which have been allotted for non-cash consideration between the date of the balance sheet and the date the special resolution was passed (s 93(1)(a), s 93(2)(a)).
		- Makes the wannabe plc compliant with the general requirement under s 593 that public companies seeking to allot shares for non-cash consideration must have such consideration valued before allotting shares.
	- A statement of compliance in the prescribed form (s 90(1)(c)(ii)).

#### Certificate of Re-registration on Incorporation

s 96: certificate issued by the Registrar. At this point, the Ltd becomes a plc and the revised articles and change of name take effect.

### Trading Disclosures

The Company, Limited Liability Partnership and Business (Names and Trading Disclosures) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/17) made under s 82 CA 2006 set out the requirements for a company to identify itself, at certain locations (including any place of business), on certain documents (including letters and order forms) and on its websites.

## Achieving Listed Company Status

Listing for the first time is known as floatation/ IPO.
