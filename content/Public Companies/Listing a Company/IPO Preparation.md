# IPO Preparation

## IPO

IPO and floatation used interchangeably. Though admission to listing and admission to trading are distinct, in practice the FCA and Stock Exchange co-operate to make the process seamless.

## Appointing Advisers

A year or two before the IPO, the company signs engagement letters with key advisers (lawyers, investment bankers).

### Company and Directors

The main marketing tool for a float is the prospectus. Directors must ensure accuracy of this information.

### Sponsor/ Financial Adviser

Listing Rule 8.2.1R provides that any company applying for a premium listing only which requires the publication of a prospectus must have a sponsor.

Listing Rule 8.3 sets out the responsibilities and principles for a sponsor, including the duty to act with due care and skill (LR 8.3.3R). With the exception of LR 8.3.5 which applies to sponsors at all times, LR 8.3 only applies to sponsors in connection with the provision of ‘sponsor services’, that is when they have to act under LR 8.2.

Listing Rules 8.4.1R to 8.4.4G set out the specific duties of the sponsor in relation to a float.

The sponsor liaises with the FCA and Stock Exchange on behalf of the company. Coordinates with all the advisers. Usually an investment bank is the sponsor, but it must be approved by the FCA.

### Broker

Advises the company with a view to ensuring there is sufficient demand for company shares once the company has floated. Liaises with potential investors to judge demand etc. The sponsor is usually also the broker.

### Financial Adviser

Advises on tactical issues including the timing of the IPO, how it should be structured etc. Usually done by the sponsor.

For a standard listing, a financial adviser will still be practically needed, but that this adviser will not be treated as a sponsor under the Listing Rules and does not need to comply with Chapter 8 of the Listing Rules.

### Reporting Accountants

Review company finances. Must ensure accuracy. 3 main reports produced;

1. “Long form” report; which is not published but forms the basis of financial information.
2. “Short form” report: published and forms part of the prospectus.
3. “Working Capital” report; produced so the sponsor can assess the company's anticipated working capital position following the IPPO.

May also provide “comfort letters” to directors to allow directors to make statements in the prospectus about the financial status of the company (required for Listing Rules).

May advise on tax.

### Lawyers

Usually 2 teams from different firms:

- One team advises the company
- One team advises the sponsor/ financial adviser

Teams must work closely together. Separate teams because there are issues on which needs of the company and the sponsor conflict (e.g., sponsor will be highly sensitive to the IPO flopping, so may be more cautious).

May be other lawyers acting for selling shareholders, if there is a conflict.

#### Company's Lawyers

Draft all documentation relating to the IPO:

- Prospectus
- Ancillary documents required to restructure the company

Responsible for verification process and ensuring directors are aware of responsibilities.

#### Sponsor's/ Financial Adviser's Lawyers

Negotiate agreements between the sponsor/ financial adviser and the company and its shareholders. Will keep an eye on the work of company's lawyers and advise their client accordingly.

#### Underwriters

Take up any shares left over after the IPO in return for a negotiated fee (typically 3-4% of the amount underwritten). If the IPO is fully subscribed, the underwriter has no liability to take shares.

Recorded in underwriting agreement. Usually, risk is spread by offering to sub-underwriters (sub-underwriting agreement).

#### Receiving Bank

Receiving bank deals with application forms and consideration for shares.

#### Registrars

Manage the company's share register and send share certificates to successful applicants. Company's clearing bank may also be involved.

#### Financial PR Consultants

Liaise with media and analysts to big up the IPO. Communications must not be misleading and must be verified by the company. So lawyers are involved. May provide directors with media training for interviews etc.

#### Printers

Print the prospectus and documentation!

## Timing

```ad-question
title: Is the company ready to float? 
Ask: 
1. Will the company meet the regulatory requirements for an IPO laid down by the FCA (in relation to listing) and the Stock Exchange (in relation to trading)?
2. Will investors perceive the company to be an attractive investment opportunity?

```

### Regulatory Requirements

s 75(4) FSMA 2000: the FCA cannot grant an application for listing unless satisfied that the Listing Rules have been complied with.

A premium listing requires compliance with the full set of conditions for listing as set out in the Listing Rules and elsewhere. A standard listing requires compliance only with those listing conditions required under relevant EU law.

```ad-note
Most companies choose a premium listing, for prestige.
```

There are multiple categories of listing within the premium and standard segments. 4 categories for premium listings; we only care about the “commercial company” category. 5 categories for standard listing; depending on the type of security listed.

Can switch from standard ↔ premium listing.

### Equity Securities Premium Listing

Before a company can be admitted to the premium segment of the Official List, FCA requirements must be met:

- Sponsor
	- Listing Rule 8.2.1R provides that any company seeking a premium listing must appoint a sponsor.
- Eligibility criteria
	- Chapter 2 of the Listing Rules sets out the conditions which a company must satisfy before it can admit any type of security to the Official List.
	- Chapter 6 of the Listing Rules sets out additional conditions which must be satisfied by commercial companies seeking a premium listing of their equity shares, such as ordinary shares.
	- The FCA may impose additional requirements if it thinks it is necessary to protect investors (LR 2.1.4R(1)).

#### Chapter 2

1. Incorporation (LR 2.2.1R). The company must be duly incorporated and operate in conformity with its constitution.
2. Validity of securities (LR 2.2.2R). The securities (for our purposes, shares) of the company must comply with all legal requirements and be authorised under the company’s memorandum and articles.
3. Admission to trading (LR 2.2.3R). Shares must be admitted to trading in order to be admitted to listing.
4. Transferability (LR 2.2.4R). In order to list successfully, shares must be marketable.
5. Market capitalisation (LR 2.2.7R). Market capitalisation refers to the number of issued shares in a company multiplied by the current market value of each share. Must be at least £3 million.
6. Whole class to be listed (LR 2.2.9R). If a company has different classes of share (e.g., ordinary shares and preference shares), it can choose to list one class and not another (e.g., list only the ordinary shares), but it cannot choose to list only part of one class.
7. Prospectus (LR 2.2.10R). A marketing document, known as a prospectus, must be approved by the FCA and published if Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or s 85 of the FSMA 2000 applies to the listing.

#### Chapter 6

1. Historical financial information (LR 6.2).
	- The company must have published or filed independently audited historical financial information for at least three years ending not more than six months before the date of the prospectus and not more than nine months before admission of the shares.
	- The accounts must be consolidated for the company and all of its subsidiaries.
	- The historical financial information must represent at least 75% of the company’s business during the three years (LR 6.2.1R and LR 6.2.4R) and show a consistent track record of making money.
2. Independence (LR 6.4.1R). The company must demonstrate that it can carry on an independent business as its main activity. Special rules apply to a company with a ‘controlling shareholder’:
	- Written and legally binding agreement (“relationship agreement”) between the controlling shareholder and the company (LR 6.5.4R) ; and
		- Transactions and arrangements between the company and the controlling shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms;
		- neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will take any action that would have the effect of preventing the company from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and
		- neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
	- the company’s articles of association must allow the election and re-election of independent directors to be conducted in accordance with set procedures (LR 6.9.1R(2)).
		- Election or re-election of independent directors must be approved both by a majority of the shareholders of the company as a whole and also by a majority of the independent shareholders alone (i.e., not including the controlling shareholder).
3. Control of the business (LR 6.6.1R). The company must demonstrate that it exercises operational control over the business it carries on as its main activity.
4. Working capital (LR 6.7.1R). The company and its subsidiaries must have sufficient working capital for the group’s requirements for at least 12 months from the date on which its prospectus is published.
5. Externally managed companies (LR 6.13.1R). The company must show that its board of directors can take strategic decisions without interference from someone outside the company.
6. Shares in public hands (LR 6.14). Following the flotation, at least **10%** (N.B. it used to be 25%) of the class of shares to be listed should be ‘in public hands’ (LR 6.14.1R and LR 6.14.2R).
	- The FCA has discretion to accept a percentage below **10%** if it considers the market will nevertheless operate properly in view of the large number of shares of the same class and the extent of their distribution to the public (LR 6.14.5G).

#### Electronic Settlement

All shares listed must be compatible with electronic settlement. EU law which has been retained post-Brexit.

### Equity Securities Standard Listing

A company seeking a standard listing of its shares must similarly comply with all of the requirements in Chapter 2. However, as a standard listing represents compliance only with the applicable EU law requirements, such a company will not have to comply with Chapter 6 , as these requirements represent ‘super-equivalent’ provisions imposed solely on a national level in the UK by the FCA.

Listing Rule 14.2.2R does, however, go on to require that at least 25% of the class of shares to be listed should be in ‘public hands’. For a standard listing there is, for example, no need to show a trading history and accounts for three years, as with a premium listing.

### Listing Non-equity Securities

Chapter 2 also applies to all other types of security which can be listed on the Main Market, such as debt securities. Chapters 17 to 20 , rather than Chapter 6 , set out the additional conditions if the securities to be listed are other than equity securities.

### Application Procedure

Chapter 3 of the Listing Rules sets out a detailed application procedure, to which the company must adhere in order to have its shares admitted to listing, be it a premium or standard listing. A key requirement is the publication of a prospectus.

#### Admission to Trading Regulation

LR 2.2.3R provides that shares cannot be admitted to listing without also being admitted to trading. There is a parallel provision in the Guidance to ADS 2.1 of the Stock Exchange’s Admission and Disclosure Standards, which provides that shares cannot be admitted to trading unless they are listed or proposed to be listed.

Consequently, after the onerous listing requirements, there are few regulatory requirements for trading. The Stock Exchange’s Admission and Disclosure Standards set out a very straightforward set of conditions (Section 2 of the ADS), which state that the company must be in compliance with the Stock Exchange’s requirements and that the Stock Exchange has discretion to refuse admission in certain circumstances.

### Commercial Requirements

Sponsor and broker need to consider whether the company is in good shape for an IPO. Consider sensible commercial questions (track record, management, market conditions, preferred market).

## Methods of Floatation

A company seeking to float can list its shares by:

1. Public offer
2. Placing
3. Intermediaries offer, or
4. Introduction.

The method chosen will depend on practical factors (how famous the company is, desired shareholder base, amount of money to be raised etc.) This is not a definitive list of how a company can list its shares.

### Public Offer

Invite the public to buy shares in the company seeking to float. Usually structured as:

1. An offer for subscription;
	1. An invitation to the public to subscribe for (buy) shares not yet in issue.
2. An offer for sale; or
	1. Invitation to the public to subscribe for shares already in issue.
	2. All money goes to selling shareholders; often this is VCs/ founder shareholders.
3. A combination of the two.

Having a public offer does not preclude institutional investors from participating in the IPO and buying shares in the company.

| Advantages                                                                                                | Disadvantages                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Good for raising large amounts of capital                                                                 | Most expensive method of floatation, since it involves underwriting. |
| Private investors can purchase shares, so the shareholder base is broader, meaning shares are more liquid | Regulatory burden is more onerous since the public are involved.                                                                      |

### Placing

Involves the marketing of shares either already in issue or not yet in issue to specified persons, or clients of the sponsor or other securities house assisting the placing. Typically, this involves the sponsor offering the shares in the company seeking to float to institutional investors.

```ad-warning
The definition of a placing in the Listing Rules states that it does not involve an offer to the public. This means it will not involve a general offer to private investors at large, but has no impact on the separate definition of offer to the public under s 85(1) of the FSMA 2000 regarding the need to prepare a prospectus.
```

Advantages:

- Cheaper than a public offer
- Discretion to choose shareholders
- Good for raising large amounts of capital.

BUT the shareholder base will be narrowing, so shares have less liquidity.

### Intermediaries Offer

Similar to a placing, but the shares can be marketed only to firms who comply with the definition of an intermediary in the FCA Handbook, which broadly means they are offered to stockbrokers independent of the sponsor and any securities house assisting with the IPO.

Can achieve a wider spread of professional investors than a placing alone. But involves considerable admin work, so quite a rare method.

### Introduction

Involves a company with shares already held by public or institutional investors being admitted to listing on the Stock Exchange without offering further shares. So it is not used to raise any money. Used in 3 situations:

1. By overseas companies which already have a wide shareholder base.
2. Companies quoted on AIM transferring to the Main Market.
3. An existing listed company deciding to “demerge” part or all of its business.

Generally, such a company will have to show a sufficiently wide spread of shareholders, with usually at least 25% being held in public hands as defined under the Listing Rules.

Pros:

- Cheapest method of floatation
- No need for underwriting – does not involve the issue or marketing of shares
- Little need for advertising

Cons:

- No opportunity to raise capital
- Don't have the same opportunities for publicity.

### Other Methods

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Institutional offer           | Offering of shares on floatation to institutional investors. Typically made by placing. Can use a fixed price (rare) or bookbuilding (sending potential investors an invitation to bid for shares, setting out a range of prices. Investor says how many it would buy for how much. Reduces underwriting risk and therefore at lower commission.) |
| Retail offer                  | Suitable for larger IPOs. More heavily regulated than an institutional offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Employee offer                | Shares offered to employees of the company. Employees given preferential allocation rights for new shares issued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Friends and family offer      | Can include suppliers, customers and initial backers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Global or international offer | May require full compliance with local securities laws                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Methods can of course be combined.

## Restructuring

Usual for a company to restructure before an IPO, just to get its house in order. The most common structure is for the holding company of the group to IPO.

### Capital Structure

Important for the offer price of shares to be fixed at the correct level. Share capital of the company may need altering to take account of this. A possible solution is to subdivide each share into a smaller denomination.

### Company Constitution

- If not incorporated as a public company, the company will need to be re-registered.
- Check articles and memorandum to ensure there is nothing inconsistent with being a listed company.
	- Should be no restriction on the transfer of shares
	- Each class of shares should have the same voting rights.
- Usual to adopt a completely new set of articles.

### Board of Directors

The board must comply with principles of corporate governance. Consider if changes need to be made or if records need to be updated.

### Legal Issues

Consider any historic breaches of the law and remedy them if possible.

```ad-action
Consider if:
- IPO arrangements will give rise to any [[Financial assistance]] issues
- s 580: no share should be issued at a discount to its nominal value.
```
