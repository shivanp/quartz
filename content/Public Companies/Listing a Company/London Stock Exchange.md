# London Stock Exchange

## Introduction

LSE is a listed company. One business area is providing a marketplace for trading in company securities. Europe's largest pool of capital.

Market functions:

1. Enable companies to raise funds by issuing new shares (primary market).
2. Allow issued shares to be traded by the public (secondary market).

## Main Market

Within Main Market there are specific groupings:

- techMARK for technology companies
- landMARK for UK regional companies
- High Growth Segment.
	- But such companies do not have to join the Official List.
	- Currently no companies on the HGS lol.
- 100 largest companies make up the FTSE 100. 100 largest companies selected each month.

## AIM

Alternative Investment Market. Currently 815 companies quoted on AIM, including Mulberry, ASOS, Hotel Chocolat.

## Dealing in Shares

| Term       | Definition                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trading    | The process by which a seller is matched with a buyer |
| Settlement | The process of paying the purchase price and transferring shares.                                                        |

### Trading

Member firms carry out most of the trading. These are investment firms (banks, stockbrokers) who trade on behalf of clients/ firms.

LSE has fully automated trading systems. For large Main Market companies, the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service “SETS”", or “the order book”) matches buy and sell orders and executes trades automatically.

SETSqx is a smaller version. Stock Exchange Automated Quotations (SEAQ) operates for smaller AIM companies. Certain member firms act as market makers in relation to certain shares.

### Settlement

For shares held in uncertified form (the vast majority), the CREST system is used. Introduced in 1996 as a paperless share settlement system through which trades can be settled. The system has legal backing under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3755). Settlement can be made within 2 business days of any trade.

CREST members hold shares as nominees for individual clients So the name of the CREST member rather than the client will be entered into the company's register of members as the legal owner.

Can also have CREST "sponsored members". This means individuals get their names on the company's register of members, but must pay a fee to a proper CREST member to use the computer system.

Other investors holding shares in electronic form hold them as nominees. So the shareholder will be the beneficial owner of their shares rather than the legal owner (Robinhood).

Stamp Duty collected by CREST during transactions.

## Investors

1. Members of the public can invest directly or indirectly (e.g., invested pension plans, savings schemes).
2. Institutional investors
	- Banks, insurance companies, pension funds etc. have sizeable funds available for investment.
	- The main institutional investors have formed their own representative bodies called Investment Protection Committees (IPCs).
	- The IPCs issue guidelines as to how members should exercise their shareholder vote. Not binding, but listed companies almost always comply.

## Regulation

```ad-statute
title: s 19 FSMA 2000 - The general prohibition.

(1) No person may carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom, or purport to do so, unless he is—
- (a) an authorised person; or
- (b) an exempt person.

(2) The prohibition is referred to in this Act as the general prohibition.
```

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has granted a recognition order to the Stock Exchange under s 290 of the FSMA 2000. This means that the Stock Exchange is a ‘recognised investment exchange’ ("RIE") and, therefore, under s 285(2) of the 2000 Act, is exempt from the general prohibition.

The LSE must comply with conditions to maintain this status (in theory):

1. Ensure business is conducted in an orderly manner and proper protection given to investors
2. Arrangement made for the provision of pre-trade and post-trade information
3. Clear and transparent rules concerning the admission of securities
4. High standards of integrity and fair dealing.

## Stock Exchange and Floatation

- FCA has responsibility for official listing of securities
- Stock Exchange has responsibility for admitting shares to trading.

Any company seeking to be a listed company must seek to have its shares:

1. admitted to listing on the Official List (for which it must liaise with the FCA); and
2. admitted to trading on the Main Market (for which it must liaise with the Stock Exchange).

### Admission and Disclosure Standards

Regulations made by the Stock Exchange for admission to trading and the continuing obligation for companies already admitted to trading.

## Future Developments

- Under ss 783 to 790 of the CA 2006, there is the power for BEIS to make regulations to enable shares to be owned or transferred without written documentation. But has not been used.
- The CSD (Central Securities Depositories Regulation) (Regulation (EU) 909/2014) came into force in September 2014. This will standardise the procedure for the settlement of securities in the EU.
	- All shares will need to be dematerialised.
	- Unsure whether UK will comply after Brexit.
