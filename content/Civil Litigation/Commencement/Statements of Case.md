# Statements of Case

```toc
```

## Introduction

### Definition

> [!defn]
> The formal documents in which parties state their case (previously known as pleadings). 

> [!statute] r 2.3
> ‘Statement of case’ –
> - (a) means a claim form, particulars of claim where these are not included in a claim form, defence, Part 20 claim, or reply to defence; and
> - (b) includes any further information given in relation to them voluntarily or by court order under rule 18.1;

They must be drafted carefully and reviewed continually as the case develops, as the trial court will not usually allow a party to pursue an issue which, on a fair reading of the statement of case, is not stated ([[Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond & Others [2000] LTL, 4 December]]). Where the parties’ evidence and submissions at trial are based on their statements of case, the  
trial judge must not determine the issues on a totally different basis ([[Satyam Enterprises Ltd v Burton [2021] EWCA Civ 287]]).

Benefits:

1. Identifies the issues to be determined, setting out the parameters of dispute.
2. Enables the judge to keep the trial within manageable bounds.

Rules set out in Part 16 CPR 1998 and associated PDs. These do not apply if a claimant has used the Part 8 procedure.

### Concision

Statement of case should be thought of as putting together the bare bones of the case–must be concise.

The contents of statements of case are not evidence in a trial ([[Arena Property Services Ltd v Europa 2000 Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 1943]]), since they are not meant to contain evidence.

General rule: any fact which needs to be proved by evidence of witness is to be proved at trial by oral evidence given in public (r 32.2(1) CPR 1998).

PD 16 para 1.4: if a statement of case exceeds 25 pages (excluding schedules) a short summary must also be filed and served. If a document exceeds 40 pages, permission of the court is needed.

### References

> [!statute] PD 16 para 13.3
> A party may:
> 
> (1) refer in his statement of case to any point of law on which his claim or defence, as the case may be, is based,
> 
> (2) give in his statement of case the name of any witness he proposes to call, and
> 
> (3) attach to or serve with this statement of case a copy of any document which he considers is necessary to his claim or defence, as the case may be (including any expert’s report to be filed in accordance with Part 35).

- No need to state any law
	- Unless parties and court would otherwise ‘be left to speculate upon the relevance in law of a purely factual narrative’ ([[Loveridge v Healey [2004] EWCA Civ 173]])
	- The material facts should establish the relevant legal basis for a claim or defence.
- Give witness details only if it helps particularise the case, e.g., the machinery was inspected by [NAME] at [TIME].
- Only attach a document if obviously of critical importance for understanding the statement of case.
- Only attach expert report if the court has already given permission for the party to rely on that expert–so generally no ([[Tejani v Fitzroy Place Residential Ltd [2020] EWHC 1856 (TCC)]])

### Formalities

> [!statute] PD 5A para 2.2
> Every document prepared by a party for filing or use at the Court must –  
>   
> 1) Unless the nature of the document renders it impracticable, be on A4 paper of durable quality having a margin, not less than 3.5 centimetres wide, 
> 2) be fully legible and should normally be typed, 
> 3) where possible be bound securely in a manner which would not hamper filing or otherwise each page should be endorsed with the case number, 
> 4) have the pages numbered consecutively, 
> 5) be divided into numbered paragraphs, 
> 6) have all numbers, including dates, expressed as figures, and 
> 7) give in the margin the reference of every document mentioned that has already been filed.

See also principles listed in [[Queen's Bench Division]] Guide.

By PD 5A, para 2.1, where a firm of solicitors prepares a statement of case, the document should be signed in the name of the firm.

### Professional Conduct

Only make assertions and put forward statements and representations which are properly arguable, to comply with para 1.4 Code for Solicitors.

> [!question] Client files statement and tells you it contains a material error intended to mislead the court
> Advise the client to amend the statement, and if they do not, cease to act. 

## Particulars of Claim

> [!statute] r 16.4(1) - Contents of the particulars of claim
> Particulars of claim must include –
> - (a) a concise statement of the facts on which the claimant relies;
> - (b) if the claimant is seeking interest, a statement to that effect and the details set out in paragraph (2);

Where the material facts stated in a claimant’s particulars of claim conflict with those in the witness statements later filed in support of that case, that may prove fatal to the claim.

If evidence changes, apply to amend statement of claim.

### Types of Claim

| Type of claim       | To attach                                                | Statute         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Written contractual | Copy of contract and any general conditions of sale      | para 7.3, PD 16 |
| Oral contractual    | Contractual words used, by whom, to whom, when and where | para 7.4, PD 16                |

Other specifics to include: para 8 PD 16.

> [!note]
> 
> It is for the defendant to state in their defence and prove at trial any alleged failure of the claimant to mitigate loss, so V need not include anything about this in PoC. 

### Interest

![[interest-claim.png]]

Claim must state (r 16.4(2)):

- % rate of interest claimed
- Date from/ to claimed
- Total amount
- Daily rate of accrual after the date of calculation.

### Particulars

Set out reasonably detailed particulars of breach and damage.

#### Summary for Relief

The relief or remedy claimed must be specifically stated in the particulars of claim. Traditionally, although not a requirement of the CPR 1998, it is often repeated in summary form towards the end of the particulars of claim, immediately before the date, and will vary depending upon the subject matter of the claim. Pre-CPR 1998, it was known as the ‘prayer for relief.’

### Statement of Truth

If the particulars of claim are not part of the claim form itself, they must be verified by a statement of truth.

## Defence

> [!statute] r 16.5 - Contents of defence
> (1) In his defence, the defendant must state –
> - (a) which of the allegations in the particulars of claim he denies;
> - (b) which allegations he is unable to admit or deny, but which he requires the claimant to prove; and
> - (c) which allegations he admits.
> 
> (2) Where the defendant denies an allegation –
> - (a) he must state his reasons for doing so; and
> - (b) if he intends to put forward a different version of events from that given by the claimant, he must state his own version.
> 
> (3) A defendant who –
> - (a) fails to deal with an allegation; but
> - (b) has set out in his defence the nature of his case in relation to the issue to which that allegation is relevant,
> 
> shall be taken to require that allegation to be proved.
> 
> (4) Where the claim includes a money claim, a defendant shall be taken to require that any allegation relating to the amount of money claimed be proved unless he expressly admits the allegation.
> 
> (5) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), a defendant who fails to deal with an allegation shall be taken to admit that allegation.
> 
> (6) If the defendant disputes the claimant’s statement of value under rule 16.3 he must –
> - (a) state why he disputes it; and
> - (b) if he is able, give his own statement of the value of the claim.
> 
> (7) If the defendant is defending in a representative capacity, he must state what that capacity is.
> 
> (8) If the defendant has not filed an acknowledgment of service under Part 10, the defendant must give an address for service.

### Notes

- Also need a statement of truth.
- The defence usually answers each paragraph of the claim in turn.
- Non-admissions are denials, but the defendant is unable to give any version of their own because the facts alleged in the claim are not within their knowledge.
	- There is no obligation on D to attempt to acquire knowledge in these circumstances ([[SPI North Ltd v Swiss Post International (UK) Ltd [2019] EWCA Civ 7]])
- If alleging contributory negligence/ failure to mitigate loss, give details.
- Give details on the expiry of any relevant limitation period (PD 16 para 13.1)
- D must include their full address including postcode and DOB.
- Consider making a counterclaim. The defence and counterclaim will then form one document.

## Reply to Defence

No obligation to file a defence; do so to allege facts in answer to the defence that were not included in particulars of claim.

r 16.7(1): a claimant who does not file a reply to the defence is not taken to admit the matters raised in the defence. But if there is a counterclaim, the claimant must file a defence to the counterclaim to prevent default judgment, and will usually incorporate a reply to the defence too.

## Amending Statement of Case

| Timing of amendment | Procedure             |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Before service      | Can amend at any time |
| After service       | Can amend only with either the written consent of all parties, or the permission of the court.                       |

When considering an application for amendment of statement of case, the court will consider:

1. Overriding objective
2. The later the amendment, the heavier the burden on the amending party to show the strength of the new case
3. Trial date fixed = very late
4. Lateness is relative.
5. Consideration of the wider public interest of ensuring other litigants can obtain justice efficiently.

| Aspect                       | Details                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directions                   | The court may approve amendment and give directions regarding any other statements of case, e.g., allowing the defence to be amended if the claim is amended.              |
| Limitation period            | If the limitation period has expired since the commencement of the case, any amended claim must arise out of substantially the same facts as the claim already being made. |
| Statement of truth           | 22.1(2): amendments to the statement of case have to be verified by a statement of truth.                                                                                  |
| Costs                        | A party applying for an amendment will usually be responsible for the costs of and caused by the amendment’s being allowed                                                 |
| Amendment without permission | If a party has amended their statement by consent/ before service, the court may disallow the amendment (r 17.2) within 14 days of service, on the application of the other party.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Request for Further Information (Part 18)

> [!statute] r 18.1(1) - Obtaining further information
> The court may at any time order a party to –
> - (a) clarify any matter which is in dispute in the proceedings; or
> - (b) give additional information in relation to any such matter,
> 
> whether or not the matter is contained or referred to in a statement of case.

If one of the parties requires further information then, before applying to the court for an order, that party should first serve a written request on the other party stating a date for the response, which must allow a reasonable time for the response.

### Request Formalities

Any request must:

1. be headed with the name of the court and the title and number of the claim;
2. state in its heading that it is a Part 18 request, identify the applicant and the respondent, and state the date on which it is made;
3. set out each request in a separate numbered paragraph;
4. identify any document and (if relevant) any paragraph or words in that document to which the request relates;
5. state the date for a response.

### Response Formalities

The response must be in writing, dated and signed by the respondent or their solicitor. The response must be verified by a statement of truth.

### Application for Court Order

If no response is received or the response is considered to be inadequate, the applicant can  
apply for an order from the court. The application can be made without notice where (PD 18, para 5.5 and [[Sheeran v Chokri [2020] EWHC 2806 (Ch)]] – Ed Sheeran copyright case):

- no response has been given,
- at least 14 days have passed since the request was served and
- the time stated in it for a response has expired.

The court will grant an order if the request is reasonably necessary and proportionate. If the court orders a response, but none is given, the court may make an unless order.
