# Commencing Proceedings

## Choice of Court

### Value of Claim

```ad-statute
title: PD 7A para 2.1
Proceedings may not be started in the High Court unless the value of the claim is $>£100,000$. 
```

So for claims worth $>£100,000$, there is often a choice of whether to start the claim in the High Court or County Court.

When to choose High Court:

```ad-statute
title: PD 7A para 2.4
A claim should be started in the High Court if by reason of:
(1) the financial value of the claim and the amount in dispute, and/or
(2) the complexity of the facts, legal issues, remedies or procedures involved, and/or
(3) the importance of the outcome of the claim to the public in general,
the claimant believes that the claim ought to be dealt with by a High Court judge.
```

### County Court

For a claim only for an amount of money, with no special procedures required, the claim form must be sent to the County Court Money Claims Centre (PD 7A para 4A.1).

| Type of claim                                                                                          | Where to send                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A claim only for an amount of money, with no special procedures required                               | the claim form must be sent to the County Court Money Claims Centre (PD 7A para 4A.1) |
| Claim for which a hearing is required                                                                  | D's home County Court or claimant's preferred hearing centre if specified.            |
| Specified claim for $<£100,000$, where there is 1 claimant, no more than 2 D's and jurisdiction is E&W | Money Claim Online                                                                    |
| Unspecified claim                                                                                      | Any County Court hearing centre of claimant's choice.                                                                                      |

### High Court

The High Court has three divisions, namely:

1. [[Queen's Bench Division]];
	- Damages for breach of contract or tort.
	- See [Guide to Litigation](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QB-Guide-2022-Final-3-Feb-22-with-bookmarks.pdf)
	- Some Business and Property Courts come under QBD, including Commercial Court.
2. [[Chancery Division]]; and
	- Trusts, land, probate business, partnership claims…
3. [[Family Division]].

### Transfer Between Courts

Part 30 of the CPR 1998 deals with the powers of the High Court and County Court to send matters from one court to another.

## Issuing Proceedings

A party who wishes to start proceedings must complete a Claim Form in the prescribed way (PD 7A, para 3.1).

Proceedings are commenced when the court ‘issues’ the claim form by sealing it with the court seal (although for limitation purposes, the relevant date is the date when the court receives the claim form).

### Completing Claim Form

The general rule is that the Claim Form will be served by the court unless the Claimant notifies the court that they want to serve it themselves.

Increasingly in practice you will find that the Claimant will want to serve the Claim Form, so that they have control over exactly when and how the Claim Form is served. In which case, they will also need to file a Certificate of Service with the court as evidence that they have served the Claim Form. In either case, you will need to consider where the Claim Form must be served.

```ad-statute
title: PD 16 para 2 - Claim Form
**2.1** Rule 16.2 refers to matters which the claim form must contain. Where the claim is for money, the claim form must also contain the statement of value referred to in rule 16.3.

**2.2** The claim form must include an address at which the claimant resides or carries on business. This paragraph applies even though the claimant's address for service is the business address of his solicitor.

**2.3** Where the defendant is an individual, the claimant should (if he is able to do so) include in the claim form an address at which the defendant resides or carries on business. This paragraph applies even though the defendant’s solicitors have agreed to accept service on the defendant’s behalf.

**2.4** Any address which is provided for the purpose of these provisions must include a postcode or its equivalent in any EEA state (if applicable), unless the court orders otherwise. Postcode information for the United Kingdom may be obtained from www.royalmail.com or the Royal Mail Address Management Guide.

**2.5** If the claim form does not show a full address, including postcode, at which the claimant(s) and defendant(s) reside or carry on business, the claim form will be issued but will be retained by the court and will not be served until the claimant has supplied a full address, including postcode, or the court has dispensed with the requirement to do so. The court will notify the claimant.

**2.6** The claim form must be headed with the title of the proceedings, including the full name of each party. The full name means, in each case where it is known:
- (a) in the case of an individual, his full unabbreviated name and title by which he is known;
- (b) in the case of an individual carrying on business in a name other than his own name, the full unabbreviated name of the individual, together with the title by which he is known, and the full trading name (for example, John Smith ‘trading as’ or ‘T/as’ ‘JS Autos’);
- (c) in the case of a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership (LLP)) –
	- (i) where partners are being sued in the name of the partnership, the full name by which the partnership is known, together with the words ‘(A Firm)’; or
	- (ii) where partners are being sued as individuals, the full unabbreviated name of each partner and the title by which he is known;
- (d) in the case of a company or limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales, the full registered name, including suffix (plc, limited, LLP, etc), if any;
- (e) in the case of any other company or corporation, the full name by which it is known, including suffix where appropriate.
```

```ad-question
title: When can a claimant seek anonymity?
CPR 1998, r 39.2(4) provides that the court must order that the identity of any party (or witness) shall not be disclosed if, and only if, it considers non-disclosure necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interests of that party (or witness).
```

#### Brief Details of Claim

Keep it concise and specify the remedy the claimant is seeking.

#### Value Claimed

Rule 16.2(1)(cc): where the claimant’s only claim is for a specified sum, the Claim Form must contain a statement of the interest accrued on that sum.

Rule 16.3(2): claim form must state the amount claimed or, if the claim is for an unspecified sum, whether the claimant expects to recover:

1. $\leq £10,000$
2. $£10,000 < S \leq £25,000$
3. $>£25,000$
4. Cannot say

Note these correspond to small claims/ fast track or multi-track.

#### High Court

Practice Direction 7A, para 3.6 provides that if a claim for an unspecified sum of money is started in the High Court, the claim form must:

1. state that the claimant expects to recover more than $£100,000$; or
2. state that some enactment provides that the claim may only be commenced in the High Court and specify that enactment; or
3. state that the claim is to be in one of the specialist High Court lists (see CPR 1998, Parts 49 and 58–62) and specify that list.

#### Court Fee

The claimant is obliged to pay a fee on issue of the claim form, based on the value of the claim. The amount of the fee should be stated on the front of the form.

#### Solicitor's Costs

To be included, see Part 45 CPR. If the claim is for an unspecified amount, write 'to be assessed'.

#### Particulars of Claim

Set out either:

- in the claim form itself, or
- in a separate document that is served either with the claim form or
- within 14 days of service of the claim form.

File with the court within seven days of service on the defendant (r 7.4(3)).

#### Statement of Truth

Who can sign?

```ad-statute
title: PD 22, para 3.1
In a statement of case, a response or an application notice, the statement of truth must be signed by:
(1) the party or his litigation friend, or
(2) the legal representative of the party or litigation friend.
```

Precedent drafting is given by PD 22 para 2.1:

> [I believe] [The (claimant or as may be) believes] that the facts stated in this [name document being verified] are true. I understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.

Date the statement as the day it is signed (para 2.5).

##### Signing by the Client

| Party       | Who can sign                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual  | Should sign in their own name, and add 'I am duly authorised by the [party] to sign this statement'                                                                         |
| Partnership | Any of the partners can sign, or a person having control/ management of the business (PD 22 para 3.6) |
| Company     | Someone holding a senior position in the company - PD 22 para 3.4 (e.g., director, treasurer, secretary, CEO, manager - para 3.5).                                                                                                       |

##### Signed by Solicitor

Sign “The [party] believes…". PD 22 para 3.7: the statement refers to the client's belief and not the solicitor's belief.

The solicitor must state the capacity in which they sign and the name of their firm.

```ad-note
PD 22, para 3.10: the solicitor must sign in their own name and not that of their firm.
```

###### Implications of Solicitor Signing

```ad-statute
title: PD 22 para 3.8
When a legal representative signs a statement of truth, they are representing:
(1) that the client on whose behalf he has signed had authorised him to do so;
(2) that before signing he had explained to the client that in signing the statement of truth he would be confirming the client’s belief that the facts stated in the document were true; and
(3) that before signing he had informed the client of the possible consequences to the client if it should subsequently appear that the client did not have an honest belief in the truth of those facts.
```

##### Statement Omission Consequences

PD 22 para 4: if a statement of case (which includes a claim form) is not verified by a

statement of truth, it remains effective unless the court strikes it out, which the court may do on its own initiative or on the application of another party.

## Parties to Proceedings

### Individuals of Full Age

If the claimant and defendant are both individuals of full age, suing or being sued in their personal capacity, there are no special considerations.

### Children & Protected Parties

A child is a person aged under 18, and a protected party is a person who is incapable of managing and administering their own affairs (including court proceedings) because of a mental disorder, as defined by the Mental Capacity Act 2005.

Part 21 CPR contains special provisions:

#### Litigation Friend

- The Rules require a protected party to have a litigation friend to conduct proceedings, whether as claimant or defendant, on their behalf.
	- This will be a person authorised under MCA 2005 to conduct legal proceedings on their behalf
	- If unsure, solicitor can seek a court order for a hearing + medical expert to confirm ([[Lindsay v Wood [2006] EWHC 2895 (QB)]])
	- A solicitor’s retainer will not necessarily automatically terminate where a client loses mental capacity ([[Blankley v Central Manchester and Manchester Children’s University Hospitals NHS Trust [2015] EWCA Civ 18]])
- A child must also have a litigation friend to conduct proceedings on their behalf, unless the court orders otherwise.
	- Usually parent/ guardian.

No applications against child/ protected party can be made except serving claim form and applying for appointment of litigation friend, without the permission of the court.

#### Friend Responsibilities

A person authorised under the 2005 Act to act as a litigation friend on behalf of a protected party must file an official copy of the document which is their authority to act/ certificate of suitability.

##### Certificate of Suitability

Should state that LF:

- Consents to act
- Believes the party to be a child/ protected party
- Can fairly and competently conduct proceedings
- Has no adverse interest
- If for claimant, undertakes to pay their costs.

The litigation friend must serve the certificate of suitability on every person on whom the claim form should be served.

#### Cessation

| Party           | Cessation of LF appointment |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Child           | When child turns 18         |
| Protected party | Does not cease when party ceases to be protected, but continues until ended by court order (sought by any party)                            |

#### Settling Cases Against child/PP

A settlement against a child/ PP is not valid until approved by the court.

- Court must be given details about
	- Whether/ to what extend D admits liability
	- Age + occupation of child/ PP
	- That LF approves the settlement.
- In most cases, must be supported by a legal opinion on the merits of the settlement.
- Formal approval usually given publicly in open court.
- If proceedings issued solely for court approval of such a settlement, claim must be made under Part 8 CPR.
- If money recovered for child/ PP, usually paid into High Court for investment.

```ad-question
title: Is a consent judgment involving a protected party without the appointment of LF/ approval of court, where the protected party's lack of capacity unknown to everyone acting in the litigation, valid?
No, [[Dunhill (a protected party by her litigation friend Paul Tasker) v Burgin [2014] UKSC 18]]
```

#### Partnerships

- Partnerships must normally sue in the name of the firm, rather than by naming individual partners.
- Partnerships must normally be sued in the name of the firm rather than in the names of the individual partners.
- Practice Direction 7A, para 5A.3: where a partnership has a name, unless it is inappropriate to do so, claims must be brought against the partnership name at time of accrual of cause of action.
- The advantage of suing partners in their firm’s name is the ability to enforce the judgment against partnership property,
- The disadvantage is the need to seek the court’s permission to enforce a judgment against persons not identified in the proceedings as partners ([[Kommalage v Sayanthakumar [2015] EWCA Civ 1832]])

#### Sole Trader

- Sole traders should sue in their own name and not in any trading or business name.
- PD 7A, para 5C.2: sole traders carrying on business within the jurisdiction and under a name other than their own can be sued in that name.
- If the claimant does not know the name of the sole trader, the claimant may sue naming the defendant under their business name.

#### Ltd Company

A company can sue and be sued under its corporate name.

#### Unnamed Parties

Permissible to sue an unnamed D only in very limited circumstances ([[Cameron v Liverpool Victoria Insurance Co Ltd [2019] UKSC 6]]).

#### Addition and Substitution of Parties

##### Application

```ad-statute
title: 19.4(2) CPR 1998
An application for permission to remove, add or substitute a party may be made by:
(a) an existing party; or
(b) a person who wishes to become a party.
```

- The application may be made without notice and must be supported by evidence.
- Nobody may be added or substituted **as a claimant** unless they have given their consent in writing and that consent has been filed with the court.

##### When

```ad-statute
title: r 19.2 CPR
(2) The court may order a person to be added as a new party if—
- (a) it is desirable to add the new party so that the court can resolve all the matters in dispute in the proceedings; or
- (b) there is an issue involving the new party and an existing party which is connected to the matters in dispute in the proceedings, and it is desirable to add the new party so that the court can resolve that issue.

(3) The court may order any person to cease to be a party if it is not desirable for that person to be a
party to the proceedings.

(4) The court may order a new party to be substituted for an existing one if—
- (a) the existing party’s interest or liability has passed to the new party; and
- (b) it is desirable to substitute the new party so that the court can resolve the matters in dispute in the proceedings.

```

Special provisions apply where parties are to be added or substituted after the end of the  
relevant limitation period–see r 19.5 for details of the necessity test.

```ad-statute
title: r 19.5
(2) The court may add or substitute a party only if—
- (a) the relevant limitation period was current when the proceedings were started; and
- (b) the addition or substitution is necessary.

(3) The addition or substitution of a party is necessary only if the court is satisfied that—
- (a) the new party is to be substituted for a party who was named in the claim form in mistake for the new party;
- (b) the claim cannot properly be carried on by or against the original party unless the new party is added or substituted as claimant or defendant; or
- (c) the original party has died or had a bankruptcy order made against him and his interest or liability has passed to the new party.
```

#### Professional Conduct

If a solicitor acts without authority of their client, they will be personally liable for costs incurred ([[Warner v Masefield [2008] EWHC 1129]]).

## Service of Claim Form

### Methods

1. Personal service;
	- Rule 6.5(3)(a) provides that a claim form is served personally on an individual by leaving it with that individual.
	- If they will not take the claim form, they should be told what the document contains, and it should be left with them or near them ([[Tseitline v Mikhelson [2015] EWHC 3065 (Comm)]]).
2. First-class post, document exchange or other service which provides for delivery on the next business day;
	- the Rules do not allow for service by second-class post or any other postal method, such as recorded delivery, unless the alternative method provides for delivery on the next working day ([[Diriye v Bojaj [2020] EWCA Civ 1400]])
3. Leaving the claim form at a specified place;
4. Through document exchange (DX)
	- If a party has given a DX box number as its address for service then that can be used to serve the claim form (PD 6A, para 2.1)
	- Where a party or their solicitor’s headed notepaper includes a DX box number, that may be used unless the party or their solicitors have indicated in writing that they are unwilling to be served by DX/ the DX number says 'not for the purposes of service'.
5. Fax or other means of electronic communication; or
	- The party to be served, or their solicitor,s must have indicated in writing a willingness to accept service by fax and also stated the fax number to which the claim form should be sent (PD 6A, para 4).
	- A party to be served by e-mail or similar electronic method must have expressly indicated in writing the e-mail address or electronic identification to which it should be sent (PD 6A, para 4)
	- PD 6A, para 4.2 requires the party who wishes to serve the claim form by e-mail or other electronic means to clarify file format/ attachment size limits etc.
6. Service on limited companies
	- Where the party to be served is a limited company, s 1139(1) CA 2006 provides that documents may be left at or posted to the registered office of the company.

### Who to Serve

General rule: any solicitor is authorised to accept service.

```ad-statute
title: CPR r 6.7
(1) Solicitor within the jurisdiction: Subject to rule 6.5(1), where –
- (a) the defendant has given in writing the business address within the jurisdiction of a solicitor as an address at which the defendant may be served with the claim form; or
- (b) a solicitor acting for the defendant has notified the claimant in writing that the solicitor is instructed by the defendant to accept service of the claim form on behalf of the defendant at a business address within the jurisdiction,

the claim form must be served at the business address of that solicitor.
```

If parties’ solicitors have been in correspondence before litigation starts, it is usual for the  
claimant’s solicitors to ask the defendant’s solicitors if they are ‘authorised to accept service of  
proceedings’.

See also:

| Provision | Concerns                                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| r 6.11    | Contractually agreed method of service        |
| r 6.12    | Service on the agent of an overseas principal |
| r 6.15    | Service by an alternative method or at an alternative place in accordance with court order.                                              |

Under r 6.15(2), the court has power to order that an alternate method of service already taken is good service. But they are usually reluctant to do so: standards will not be lowered for a claimant in person ([[Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12]]) and there is no duty requiring solicitors to draw attention to the mistake made by the other party in serving a claim, for which they were not responsible ([[Woodward v Phoenix Healthcare Distribution Ltd [2019] EWCA Civ 985]]).

### Where to Serve

| Nature of defendant to be served                                        | Place of service                                                                                                                                                          |

| 1. Individual                                                           | Usual or last known residence.                                                                                                                                            |
| 2. Individual being sued in the name of a business                      | Usual or last known residence of the individual; or principal or last known place of business.                                                                            |
| 3. Individual being sued in the business name of a partnership          | Usual or last known residence of the individual; or principal or last known place of business of the partnership.                                                         |
| 4. Limited liability partnership                                        | Principal office of the partnership; or any place of business of the partnership within the jurisdiction which has a real connection with the claim.                      |
| 5. Corporation (other than a company) incorporated in England and Wales | Principal office of the corporation; or any place within the jurisdiction where the corporation carries on its activities and which has a real connection with the claim. |
| 6. Company registered in England and Wales                              | Principal office of the company; or any place of business of the company within the jurisdiction which has a real connection with the claim.                              |
| 7. Any other company or corporation                                     | Any place within the jurisdiction where the corporation carries on its activities; or any place of business of the company within the jurisdiction.                       |

#### Reasonable Steps

If a claimant has reason to believe that the address above is not the current address of D, they must take reasonable steps to ascertain D's address or place of business (6.9(3)).

#### Dispensing Service Requirement

In exceptional circumstances the court can dispense with service of the claim form under r 6.16(1), e.g., [[Lonestar Communications Corp LLC v Kaye & Ors [2019] EWHC 3008 (Comm)]].

### When to Serve

By r 7.5(1), a claimant who wishes to serve a claim form in the jurisdiction must complete the steps required **before 12.00 midnight on the calendar day four months after the date of issue of the claim form**.

### How to Serve

| Method of service                                                                                            | Step required                                                                       |

### Deemed Service

```ad-important
Rule 6.14 introduces a simple, indisputable presumption that the claim form is deemed to have been served on the second business day after the step set out above has occurred.
```

r 6.2(b): ‘business day’ here means any day except Saturday, Sunday, a bank holiday, Good Friday or Christmas Day.

### Who Serves

Court usually serves by first class post, except for when (r 6.4(1)):

1. a rule or Practice Direction provides that the claimant must serve the claim form; or
2. the claimant notifies the court that they want to serve it; or
3. the court orders or directs otherwise.

#### Undelivered Claim

```ad-statute
title: r 6.18 CPR
(1) Where –
- (a) the court serves the claim form by post; and
- (b) the claim form is returned to the court,

the court will send notification to the claimant that the claim form has been returned.

(2) The claim form will be deemed to be served unless the address for the defendant on the claim form is not the relevant address for the purpose of rules 6.7 to 6.10.
```

#### After Service

```ad-statute
title: r 6.17(2) CPR - Certificate of service
Where the claimant serves the claim form, the claimant –
- (a) must file a certificate of service within 21 days of service of the particulars of claim, unless all the defendants to the proceedings have filed acknowledgments of service within that time; and
- (b) may not obtain judgment in default under Part 12 unless a certificate of service has been filed.
```

#### Service Out of Jurisdiction

| Type of cases                                       | Process                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cases governed by 2005 Hague Convention or contract | No special requirement to serve proceedings outside of E&W |
| All other cases                                     | Claimant must obtain permission to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction.                                                            |

## Extending Time for Service

The court has a general discretion to extend the period in which a claimant has to serve a Claim Form, from the state of issue.

- Ideally, apply for extension before deadline
- If not, court still has discretion, but will need to be satisfied that:
	- The court has been unable to serve the claim form; **or**
	- Claimant has taken all reasonable steps to serve the claim form but has been unable to do so; **and**
	- Claimant has acted promptly in making the application.

r 2.11:

> ‘Unless these Rules or a practice direction provide otherwise or the court orders otherwise, the time specified by a rule or by the court for a person to do any act may be varied by the written agreement of the parties.’

So the parties' solicitors can enter into a written agreement to extend the time for service of the claim form.

## Service of Other Documents

Same as claim forms for how to serve, who to serve and where to serve - see rules 6.20-6.29.

| Document exchange                                                                        | The second day after it was left with, delivered to or collected by the relevant service provider provided that day is a business day; or if not, the next business day after that day.         |
| Fax                                                                                      | If the transmission of the fax is completed on a business day before 4.30 pm, on that day; or in any other case, on the next business day after the day on which it was transmitted.            |
| Other electronic method                                                                  | If the e-mail or other electronic transmission is sent on a business day before 4.30 pm, on that day; or in any other case, on the next business day after the day on which it was sent.        |

## Service of Particulars of Claim

```ad-statute
title: PD 7A, para 6.1
Where the claimant does not include the particulars of claim in the claim form, they may be served separately:

(1) either at the same time as the claim form, or

(2) within 14 days after service of the claim form provided that the service of the particulars of claim is within 4 months after the date of issue of the claim form
```

## Limitation Period

Under CPR 7.5, the Claim Form must be served on the Defendant within 4 months of the Claim Form being issued – “issued” meaning stamped, dated and given a claim number by the court.  (Note that the timing is different for “service out of the jurisdiction”). Once the Claim Form is (deemed) served, CPR 7.4 provides that the Particulars of Claim must also be served within a further 14 days. 

By Practice Direction 7A para 6.1 (and also CPR 7.4), service of both Claim Form and Particulars of Claim must occur within the 4-month period triggered by the issue of the Claim Form.  The 4-month period effectively forms a “long-stop” within which the Claimant’s initial documents in the claim must be served on the Defendant. So on the facts given, the latest possible date for service of the Particulars of Claim would be 14 October. 

FURTHER POINT OF INTEREST

There is a further point of interest in relation to the 4-month “long-stop”, _specifically_ as it applies to the _Claim Form_.  A tension exists between CPR 7.5 and CPR 6.14, which states that a Claim Form will be deemed served on the second business day after the “relevant step” (posting, faxing, personal service or any other relevant method) has been completed.  A literal reading of the rules would suggest that if the “relevant step” is completed for a Claim Form right at the end of the 4-month “long-stop”, deemed service of the Claim Form (being two business days _later_) might fall outside it, and be too late.  Recent decisions of the court, however, have indicated that as long as the _relevant step itself_ is completed for the Claim Form within 4 months of issue, _service_ of the Claim Form will also be treated as being compliant with CPR 7.5.

# Responding to Proceedings

## First Steps

There are 3 broad ways in which D may respond:

1. Filing an acknowledgement of service;
2. Filing a defence;
3. Filing an admission.

If the defendant does not respond within the  
appropriate time period, the claimant may enter judgment ‘in default’ of the defendant filing  
an acknowledgement of service and/or a defence.

![[responses-to-claim.png]]

## Computing Time

```ad-statute
title: CPR r 2.8 - Time
(1) This rule shows how to calculate any period of time for doing any act which is specified –  
- (a) by these Rules; 
- (b) by a practice direction; or 
- (c) by a judgment or order of the court.  
  
(2) A period of time expressed as a number of days shall be computed as clear days.  
  
(3) In this rule ‘clear days’ means that in computing the number of days –  
- (a) the day on which the period begins; and 
- (b) if the end of the period is defined by reference to an event, the day on which that event occurs  

are not included.
```

Any order imposing a time limit should, wherever practicable, give a calendar date, i.e., the day, month, year and deadline time for compliance.

## Acknowledgement of Service (part 10)

![[file-acknowledgement.png]]

## Time Limits

If the defendant fails to respond within a set time, the claimant can usually enter judgment.

```ad-statute
title: r 10.2 - Consequence of not filing an acknowledgment of service
If—
- (a) a defendant fails to file an acknowledgment of service within the period specified in rule 10.3; and
- (b) does not within that period file a defence in accordance with Part 15 or serve or file an admission in accordance with Part 14, 

the claimant may obtain default judgment if Part 12 allows it.
```

```ad-statute
title: r 10.3(1)- The period for filing an acknowledgment of service

(1) The general rule is that the period for filing an acknowledgment of service is—
- (a) 14 days after service of the particulars of claim where the defendant is served with a claim form which states that particulars of claim are to follow; and
- (b) 14 days after service of the claim form in any other case.
```

Note that service means deemed service. So:

|                                                     | When default judgment can be entered                        |
|:--------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claim form served with particulars of claim         | 15th day after (deemed) service of the claim form           |
| Particulars of claim served after claim form served | 15th day after (deemed) service of the particulars of claim |

### Completing Acknowledgement Form

D should include:

- Full name, pointing out correction if incorrect.
- Address for service (in E&W)
- Whether D intends to defend all of claim/ part of claim/ contest jurisdiction.
- The form must be signed by the defendant or their solicitor.

File form at the court where the claim was issued. The court will then notify the claimant in writing.

| Types of defendant | Who signs                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Business Law and Practice/Company Law/Business models/Partnership]]    | Service acknowledged in the name of the partnership by any partner/ authorised person, on behalf of all those who were partners at the time. |
| Company            | Senior person (e.g., director, treasurer, secretary) signs.                                                                                                                                              |

### Disputing Jurisdiction

r 11: if D wants to dispute the jurisdiction of the court, they must indicate this on an acknowledgement of service. Must then challenge the jurisdiction by making an application within 14 days, or they will be treated as having submitted to the jurisdiction.

If the court refuses the defendant’s application, the original acknowledgement of service ceases to have effect and the defendant must file a further acknowledgement within 14 days.

### Defence (part 15)

#### Time Limit

```ad-statute
title: r 15.4(1) - The period for filing a defence
(1) The general rule is that the period for filing a defence is –
- (a) 14 days after service of the particulars of claim; or
- (b) if the defendant files an acknowledgment of service under Part 10, 28 days after service of the particulars of claim.
```

```ad-warning
Remember that the day of deemed service of a claim form or particulars of claim will not always be the same. So if the claim form and particulars of the claim are served together, there is ambiguity. Interpret this as r 15.4 sets out the general position, but r 10.3 applies in respect of default judgment.
```

To avoid this ambiguity, best to file an acknowledgement of service as quickly as possible and then 28 days given from service of particulars to file defence.

#### Time Extension

The time for filing a defence may be extended by agreement between the parties for a period of up to 28 days. Should then give the court written notice of the agreement.

Any further extension must be authorised by the court, which will usually grant a short extension at D's expense, or a longer one if pre-action protocol has not been followed.

A party will need good reasons justifying the extension.

#### Drafting

| Type of claim          | Response |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| Specified amount       | Form N9B |
| Unspecified amount     | Form N9C |
| Solicitor acting for D | Defence usually prepared separately.         |

#### Filing and Serving

When the defence is filed, a copy must be served on all other parties. The court will effect service, unless the defendant’s solicitor has told the court that they will do so.

### Admissions (part 14)

#### Whole Admission

Admission of whole claim but request time to pay:

![[admission-request-time.png]]

Where deciding the time and rate of payment, the court will take into account:

1. the defendant’s statement of means;
2. the claimant’s objections to the defendant’s request; and
3. any other relevant factors.

#### Part Admission–Specified

![[admission-part-specified.png]]

#### Part Admission–Unspecified

No offer:

MERMAID1

Offer made:

MERMAID2

#### Challenging

When a court decides time or rate of payment, either party may apply for re-determination by a judge within 14 days of service of the determination on the applicant.

#### Interest

```ad-test
title: Claiming interest
Judgment may include interest if following conditions met:
1. Particulars of claim include a claim for interest, and all details set out in [r 16.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part16#16.4) complied with.
2. Where interest claimed under s 25A SCA 1981 or s 69 CCA 1984, rate is no hgher than rate of interest payable on judgment debts (8% pa) when claim form was issued.
3. Request for judgment includes calculation of interest claimed since claim form.
```

If the above conditions are not satisfied, the judgment will be for an amount of interest to be decided by the court (e.g., for interest claimed under Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998).

Can be varied:

```ad-statute
title: PD 14 para 6 - Varying the rate of payment

**6.1** Either party may, on account of a change in circumstances since the date of the decision (or re-determination as the case may be) apply to vary the time and rate of payment of instalments still remaining unpaid.

**6.2** An application to vary under paragraph 6.1 above should be made in accordance with Part 23.
```

### Default Judgment (part 12)

![[default-judgment.png]]

#### Not Available

The claimant may not enter a default judgment in the following types of cases:

1. a claim for delivery of goods under an agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
2. a Part 8 claim;
3. a mortgage claim;
4. a claim for provisional damages;
5. a claim in a specialist court.

#### Procedure

Must fill in the relevant form, and also satisfy the court that:

1. the particulars of claim have been served on the defendant;
2. the defendant has not acknowledged service or filed a defence (or any document intended to be a defence), at the date on which judgment is entered, and the relevant time period has expired;
3. the defendant has not satisfied the claim;
4. the defendant has not admitted liability for the full amount of the claim.

```ad-tip
The filing of an acknowledgment of service or a defence, even late, will prevent the entry of
judgment in default.
```

#### Details

| Aspect of default judgment | Details                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Specified amount           | If the request for specified amount does not indicate date of full payment or payment by instalments, the court will normally give judgment for immediate full payment.                  |
| Unspecified amount         | Court decides amount of claim and costs at a full hearing.                                                                                                                               |
| Interest                   | See test above for when default judgment will take the interest as given, otherwise the court determines.                                                                                |
| Co-defendants              | The claimant may enter a default judgment against one or more of the co-defendants while proceeding with their claim against the other defendants, if they can be dealt with separately. |
| Setting aside              | A defendant against whom a default judgment has been entered may apply to have it set aside.                                                                                             |
| Effect of stays            | Freezes all time limits and deadlines.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

```ad-important
Other than in cases where judgment has been wrongly entered, an application to set aside judgment in default is treated as an application for “relief from sanctions”.  This means that the case of _Denton v TH White_ should be considered in addition to the relevant Civil Procedure Rule.
```

![[denton-rules.png]]

# Statements of Case

## Introduction

### Definition

```ad-defn
The formal documents in which parties state their case (previously known as pleadings). 
```

```ad-statute
title: r 2.3
‘Statement of case’ –
- (a) means a claim form, particulars of claim where these are not included in a claim form, defence, Part 20 claim, or reply to defence; and
- (b) includes any further information given in relation to them voluntarily or by court order under rule 18.1;
```

They must be drafted carefully and reviewed continually as the case develops, as the trial court will not usually allow a party to pursue an issue which, on a fair reading of the statement of case, is not stated ([[Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond & Others [2000] LTL, 4 December]]). Where the parties’ evidence and submissions at trial are based on their statements of case, the  
trial judge must not determine the issues on a totally different basis ([[Satyam Enterprises Ltd v Burton [2021] EWCA Civ 287]]).

Benefits:

1. Identifies the issues to be determined, setting out the parameters of dispute.
2. Enables the judge to keep the trial within manageable bounds.

Rules set out in Part 16 CPR 1998 and associated PDs. These do not apply if a claimant has used the Part 8 procedure.

### Concision

Statement of case should be thought of as putting together the bare bones of the case–must be concise.

The contents of statements of case are not evidence in a trial ([[Arena Property Services Ltd v Europa 2000 Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 1943]]), since they are not meant to contain evidence.

General rule: any fact which needs to be proved by evidence of witness is to be proved at trial by oral evidence given in public (r 32.2(1) CPR 1998).

PD 16 para 1.4: if a statement of case exceeds 25 pages (excluding schedules) a short summary must also be filed and served. If a document exceeds 40 pages, permission of the court is needed.

### References

```ad-statute
title: PD 16 para 13.3
A party may:

(1) refer in his statement of case to any point of law on which his claim or defence, as the case may be, is based,

(2) give in his statement of case the name of any witness he proposes to call, and

(3) attach to or serve with this statement of case a copy of any document which he considers is necessary to his claim or defence, as the case may be (including any expert’s report to be filed in accordance with Part 35).
```

- No need to state any law
	- Unless parties and court would otherwise ‘be left to speculate upon the relevance in law of a purely factual narrative’ ([[Loveridge v Healey [2004] EWCA Civ 173]])
	- The material facts should establish the relevant legal basis for a claim or defence.
- Give witness details only if it helps particularise the case, e.g., the machinery was inspected by [NAME] at [TIME].
- Only attach a document if obviously of critical importance for understanding the statement of case.
- Only attach expert report if the court has already given permission for the party to rely on that expert–so generally no ([[Tejani v Fitzroy Place Residential Ltd [2020] EWHC 1856 (TCC)]])

### Formalities

```ad-statute
title: PD 5A para 2.2
Every document prepared by a party for filing or use at the Court must –  
  
1) Unless the nature of the document renders it impracticable, be on A4 paper of durable quality having a margin, not less than 3.5 centimetres wide, 
2) be fully legible and should normally be typed, 
3) where possible be bound securely in a manner which would not hamper filing or otherwise each page should be endorsed with the case number, 
4) have the pages numbered consecutively, 
5) be divided into numbered paragraphs, 
6) have all numbers, including dates, expressed as figures, and 
7) give in the margin the reference of every document mentioned that has already been filed.
```

See also principles listed in [[Queen's Bench Division]] Guide.

By PD 5A, para 2.1, where a firm of solicitors prepares a statement of case, the document should be signed in the name of the firm.

### Professional Conduct

Only make assertions and put forward statements and representations which are properly arguable, to comply with para 1.4 Code for Solicitors.

```ad-question
title: Client files statement and tells you it contains a material error intended to mislead the court 
Advise the client to amend the statement, and if they do not, cease to act. 
```

## Particulars of Claim

```ad-statute
title: r 16.4(1) - Contents of the particulars of claim
Particulars of claim must include –
- (a) a concise statement of the facts on which the claimant relies;
- (b) if the claimant is seeking interest, a statement to that effect and the details set out in paragraph (2);
```

Where the material facts stated in a claimant’s particulars of claim conflict with those in the witness statements later filed in support of that case, that may prove fatal to the claim.

If evidence changes, apply to amend statement of claim.

```ad-note

It is for the defendant to state in their defence and prove at trial any alleged failure of the claimant to mitigate loss, so V need not include anything about this in PoC. 
```

### Interest

![[interest-claim.png]]

Claim must state (r 16.4(2)):

- % rate of interest claimed
- Date from/ to claimed
- Total amount
- Daily rate of accrual after the date of calculation.

### Particulars

Set out reasonably detailed particulars of breach and damage.

#### Summary for Relief

The relief or remedy claimed must be specifically stated in the particulars of claim. Traditionally, although not a requirement of the CPR 1998, it is often repeated in summary form towards the end of the particulars of claim, immediately before the date, and will vary depending upon the subject matter of the claim. Pre-CPR 1998, it was known as the ‘prayer for relief.’

### Statement of Truth

If the particulars of claim are not part of the claim form itself, they must be verified by a statement of truth.

## Defence

```ad-statute
title: r 16.5 - Contents of defence
(1) In his defence, the defendant must state –
- (a) which of the allegations in the particulars of claim he denies;
- (b) which allegations he is unable to admit or deny, but which he requires the claimant to prove; and
- (c) which allegations he admits.

(2) Where the defendant denies an allegation –
- (a) he must state his reasons for doing so; and
- (b) if he intends to put forward a different version of events from that given by the claimant, he must state his own version.

(3) A defendant who –
- (a) fails to deal with an allegation; but
- (b) has set out in his defence the nature of his case in relation to the issue to which that allegation is relevant,

shall be taken to require that allegation to be proved.

(4) Where the claim includes a money claim, a defendant shall be taken to require that any allegation relating to the amount of money claimed be proved unless he expressly admits the allegation.

(5) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), a defendant who fails to deal with an allegation shall be taken to admit that allegation.

(6) If the defendant disputes the claimant’s statement of value under rule 16.3 he must –
- (a) state why he disputes it; and
- (b) if he is able, give his own statement of the value of the claim.

(7) If the defendant is defending in a representative capacity, he must state what that capacity is.

(8) If the defendant has not filed an acknowledgment of service under Part 10, the defendant must give an address for service.
```

### Notes

- Also need a statement of truth.
- The defence usually answers each paragraph of the claim in turn.
- Non-admissions are denials, but the defendant is unable to give any version of their own because the facts alleged in the claim are not within their knowledge.
	- There is no obligation on D to attempt to acquire knowledge in these circumstances ([[SPI North Ltd v Swiss Post International (UK) Ltd [2019] EWCA Civ 7]])
- If alleging contributory negligence/ failure to mitigate loss, give details.
- Give details on the expiry of any relevant limitation period (PD 16 para 13.1)
- D must include their full address including postcode and DOB.
- Consider making a counterclaim. The defence and counterclaim will then form one document.

## Reply to Defence

No obligation to file a defence; do so to allege facts in answer to the defence that were not included in particulars of claim.

r 16.7(1): a claimant who does not file a reply to the defence is not taken to admit the matters raised in the defence. But if there is a counterclaim, the claimant must file a defence to the counterclaim to prevent default judgment, and will usually incorporate a reply to the defence too.

## Amending Statement of Case

| Timing of amendment | Procedure             |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Before service      | Can amend at any time |
| After service       | Can amend only with either the written consent of all parties, or the permission of the court.                       |

When considering an application for amendment of statement of case, the court will consider:

1. Overriding objective
2. The later the amendment, the heavier the burden on the amending party to show the strength of the new case
3. Trial date fixed = very late
4. Lateness is relative.
5. Consideration of the wider public interest of ensuring other litigants can obtain justice efficiently.

| Aspect                       | Details                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directions                   | The court may approve amendment and give directions regarding any other statements of case, e.g., allowing the defence to be amended if the claim is amended.              |
| Limitation period            | If the limitation period has expired since the commencement of the case, any amended claim must arise out of substantially the same facts as the claim already being made. |
| Statement of truth           | 22.1(2): amendments to the statement of case have to be verified by a statement of truth.                                                                                  |
| Costs                        | A party applying for an amendment will usually be responsible for the costs of and caused by the amendment’s being allowed                                                 |
| Amendment without permission | If a party has amended their statement by consent/ before service, the court may disallow the amendment (r 17.2) within 14 days of service, on the application of the other party.                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Request for Further Information (Part 18)

```ad-statute
title: r 18.1(1) - Obtaining further information
The court may at any time order a party to –
- (a) clarify any matter which is in dispute in the proceedings; or
- (b) give additional information in relation to any such matter,

whether or not the matter is contained or referred to in a statement of case.
```

If one of the parties requires further information then, before applying to the court for an order, that party should first serve a written request on the other party stating a date for the response, which must allow a reasonable time for the response.

### Request Formalities

Any request must:

1. be headed with the name of the court and the title and number of the claim;
2. state in its heading that it is a Part 18 request, identify the applicant and the respondent, and state the date on which it is made;
3. set out each request in a separate numbered paragraph;
4. identify any document and (if relevant) any paragraph or words in that document to which the request relates;
5. state the date for a response.

### Response Formalities

The response must be in writing, dated and signed by the respondent or their solicitor. The response must be verified by a statement of truth.

### Application for Court Order

If no response is received or the response is considered to be inadequate, the applicant can  
apply for an order from the court. The application can be made without notice where (PD 18, para 5.5 and [[Sheeran v Chokri [2020] EWHC 2806 (Ch)]] – Ed Sheeran copyright case):

- no response has been given,
- at least 14 days have passed since the request was served and
- the time stated in it for a response has expired.

The court will grant an order if the request is reasonably necessary and proportionate. If the court orders a response, but none is given, the court may make an unless order.

# Additional Claims

Additional claims are defined in r 20.2 to include counterclaims and additional claims against a third party for a contribution/ indemnity.

## Procedure

### Counterclaims (r 20.4)

If D wishes to counterclaim, they should file particulars of the counterclaim with their defence → no need to request permission from the court to make a counter-claim. Else, permission needed.

```ad-statute
title: r 20.4 - Defendant’s counterclaim against the claimant

(1) A defendant may make a counterclaim against a claimant by filing particulars of the counterclaim.

(2) A defendant may make a counterclaim against a claimant—
- (a) without the court’s permission if he files it with his defence; or
- (b) at any other time with the court’s permission.

(3) Part 10 (acknowledgment of service) does not apply to a claimant who wishes to defend a counterclaim. 
```

#### Responding

If they wish to dispute the counterclaim, the claimant (who does not have the option of

acknowledging service) has to file a defence to the counterclaim within the usual 14-day period.

This will usually be a reply and defence. If the claimant fails to file a defence to the counterclaim, the defendant may enter judgment in default on the counterclaim. Therefore, if the claimant requires more time to file a defence to the counterclaim, they should request an extension of time from D (of up to 28 days).

### Contribution/ Indemnity (r 20.6)

```ad-statute
title: r 20.6 - Defendant’s claim for contribution or indemnity from co-defendant

A defendant who has filed an acknowledgment of service or a defence may make a Part 20 claim for contribution or indemnity against another defendant by—
- (a) filing a notice containing a statement of the nature and grounds of his claim; and
- (b) serving that notice on the other defendant.
```

#### Permission

No permission is required if the defendant files and serves the notice with the defence or, if the party against whom the claim is made is added later, within 28 days of that party’s filing their defence. Permission is required to file and serve the notice at all other times.

### Other Additional Proceedings

In other additional claims, such as a claim against a third party, the defendant may make an additional claim without the court’s permission by issuing an appropriate claim form before or at the same time as they file a defence. Particulars of the additional claim must be contained in or served with the additional claim.

#### Permission

If an additional claim is not issued at that time, the court’s permission will be required. The application for permission can be made without notice, unless the court directs otherwise. If permission is needed, must give the court all the details, including a summary of the facts. The court will then consider the application in light of (r 20.9(2)):

1. Connection between additional claim and original
2. Whether substantially the same remedy is sought
3. Whether the additional claim involves more parties getting involved.

### Service (r 20.8)

```ad-statute
title: r 20.8 - Service of a Part 20 claim form
(1) Where a Part 20 claim may be made without the court’s permission, the Part 20 claim form must—
- (a) in the case of a counterclaim, be served on every other party when a copy of the defence is served;
- (b) in the case of any other Part 20 claim, be served on the person against whom it is made within 14 days after the date on which the party making the Part 20 claim files his defence.

(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a claim for contribution or indemnity made in accordance with rule 20.6.

(3) Where the court gives permission to make a Part 20 claim it will at the same time give directions as to the service of the Part 20 claim. 
```

### Judgment in Default (r 20.11)

Special rules apply where the additional claim is not a counterclaim or a claim by a defendant for an indemnity or contribution against another defendant under r 20.6.

```ad-statute
title: r 20.11
(1) This rule applies if—
- (a) the Part 20 claim is not—
	- (i) a counterclaim; or
	- (ii) a claim by a defendant for contribution(GL) or indemnity(GL) against another defendant under rule 20.6; and
- (b) the party against whom a Part 20 claim is made fails to file an acknowledgment of service or defence in respect of the Part 20 claim.

(2) The party against whom the Part 20 claim is made—
- (a) is deemed to admit the Part 20 claim, and is bound by any judgment or decision in the main proceedings in so far as it is relevant to any matter arising in the Part 20 claim;
- (b) subject to paragraph (3), if default judgment under Part 12 is given against the Part 20 claimant, the Part 20 claimant may obtain judgment in respect of the Part 20 claim by filing a request in the relevant practice form.
```

### Directions (r 20.13)

If a defence is filed to an additional claim (other than a counterclaim), the court will arrange a hearing to give directions as to the future conduct of the case.

### Title of Proceedings

The title of every additional claim should include both the full name of each party and their status in the proceedings.

## Drafting Counterclaim

- When drafting the defence and counterclaim together, subdivide into two sections and continue the paragraph numbering through.
- Make sure the paragraph numbering makes sense by itself.
- End with “and the defendant counterclaims”
- Make sure the counterclaim makes self as a self-standing claim, but fine to cross reference.
