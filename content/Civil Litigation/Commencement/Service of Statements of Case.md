# Service of Statements of Case

## Importance

- Serving a claim form on D at the wrong address can cause limitation problems.
- Once the Claim Form is served, various deadlines start to run.

## Who

General rule: the Claim Form will be served by the court unless the Claimant notifies the court they want to serve it themselves.

- This frequently happens in practice, since claimants want to control when and how the Claim Form is served.
- Must also file a Certificate of Service as evidence that the Claim Form has been served.

## Where

- If D has authorised a solicitor to accept service of proceedings on their behalf, serve the Claim Form to the solicitor.
- Otherwise, consider where the Claim Form could be served – see Part 6 CPR.

## Deemed Service

The rules for service of documents, including the Claim Form, are set out in CPR Part 6. Under CPR 6.14, the Claim Form is deemed served on the second business day after completion of the relevant step required to effect service by the method chosen.

As with a Claim Form, a Statement of Case can be served by a variety of different methods, such as personal service, postal or DX service.

| Method of service                                               | Deemed date of service                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Personal service                                                | If the document is served personally before 4.30pm on a business day, on that day; or in any other case, on the next business day after that day.                                               |
| First-class post (or other service which provides for day)      | The second day after it was posted, left with, delivered to or collected by the relevant service provider provided that day is a business day; or if not, the next business day after that day. |
| Delivering the document to or leaving it at a permitted address | If it is delivered to or left at the permitted address on a business day before 4.30pm, on that day; or in any other case, on the next business day after that day.                             |
| Document exchange                                               | The second day after it was left with, delivered to or collected by the relevant service provider provided that day is a business day; or if not, the next business day after that day.         |
| Fax                                                             | If the transmission of the fax is completed on a business day before 4.30 pm, on that day; or in any other case, on the next business day after the day on which it was transmitted.            |
| Other electronic method                                         | If the e-mail or other electronic transmission is sent on a business day before 4.30 pm, on that day; or in any other case, on the next business day after the day on which it was sent.        |

## Periods for Service

The court permits a defendant 14 days to respond to the Particulars of Claim. This can either be by filing an Acknowledgement of Service or a Defence.

If the Defendant files an Acknowledgement of Service they then have 28 days, from the deemed date of service of the Particulars of Claim, to file and serve a Defence.

```ad-statute
title: Acknowledgment of Service – CPR 10.3(1)

(1) The general rule is that the period for filing an acknowledgment of service is –
- (a) where the defendant is served with a claim form which states that particulars of claim are to follow, 14 days after service of the particulars of claim; and
- (b) in any other case, 14 days after service of the claim form.
```

```ad-statute
title: Defence – CPR 15.4(1)

(1) The general rule is that the period for filing a defence is – 
- (a) 14 days after service of the particulars of claim; or
- (b) if the defendant files an acknowledgment of service under Part 10, 28 days after service of the particulars of claim.
```

```ad-statute
title: Reply to defence - CPR 15.8

If a claimant files a reply to the defence, he must – 
- (a) file his reply when he files his directions questionnaire; and
- (b) serve his reply on the other parties at the same time as he files it.
```

## Limitation Period

Under CPR 7.5, the Claim Form must be served on the Defendant within 4 months of the Claim Form being issued – “issued” meaning stamped, dated and given a claim number by the court.  (Note that the timing is different for “service out of the jurisdiction”). Once the Claim Form is (deemed) served, CPR 7.4 provides that the Particulars of Claim must also be served within a further 14 days. 

By Practice Direction 7A para 6.1 (and also CPR 7.4), service of both Claim Form and Particulars of Claim must occur within the 4-month period triggered by the issue of the Claim Form.  The 4-month period effectively forms a “long-stop” within which the Claimant’s initial documents in the claim must be served on the Defendant. So on the facts given, the latest possible date for service of the Particulars of Claim would be 14 October. 

FURTHER POINT OF INTEREST

There is a further point of interest in relation to the 4-month “long-stop”, _specifically_ as it applies to the _Claim Form_.  A tension exists between CPR 7.5 and CPR 6.14, which states that a Claim Form will be deemed served on the second business day after the “relevant step” (posting, faxing, personal service or any other relevant method) has been completed.  A literal reading of the rules would suggest that if the “relevant step” is completed for a Claim Form right at the end of the 4-month “long-stop”, deemed service of the Claim Form (being two business days _later_) might fall outside it, and be too late.  Recent decisions of the court, however, have indicated that as long as the _relevant step itself_ is completed for the Claim Form within 4 months of issue, _service_ of the Claim Form will also be treated as being compliant with CPR 7.5.
