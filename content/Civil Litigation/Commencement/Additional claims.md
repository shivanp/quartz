# Additional Claims

```toc
```

Additional claims are defined in r 20.2 to include counterclaims and additional claims against a third party for a contribution/ indemnity.

## Procedure

### Counterclaims (r 20.4)

If D wishes to counterclaim, they should file particulars of the counterclaim with their defence → no need to request permission from the court to make a counter-claim. Else, permission needed.

> [!statute] r 20.4 - Defendant’s counterclaim against the claimant
> 
> (1) A defendant may make a counterclaim against a claimant by filing particulars of the counterclaim.
> 
> (2) A defendant may make a counterclaim against a claimant—
> - (a) without the court’s permission if he files it with his defence; or
> - (b) at any other time with the court’s permission.
> 
> (3) Part 10 (acknowledgment of service) does not apply to a claimant who wishes to defend a counterclaim. 

#### Responding

If they wish to dispute the counterclaim, the claimant (who does not have the option of

acknowledging service) has to file a defence to the counterclaim within the usual 14-day period.

This will usually be a reply and defence. If the claimant fails to file a defence to the counterclaim, the defendant may enter judgment in default on the counterclaim. Therefore, if the claimant requires more time to file a defence to the counterclaim, they should request an extension of time from D (of up to 28 days).

### Contribution/ Indemnity (r 20.6)

> [!statute] r 20.6 - Defendant’s claim for contribution or indemnity from co-defendant
> 
> A defendant who has filed an acknowledgment of service or a defence may make a Part 20 claim for contribution or indemnity against another defendant by—
> - (a) filing a notice containing a statement of the nature and grounds of his claim; and
> - (b) serving that notice on the other defendant.

#### Permission

No permission is required if the defendant files and serves the notice with the defence or, if the party against whom the claim is made is added later, within 28 days of that party’s filing their defence. Permission is required to file and serve the notice at all other times.

### Other Additional Proceedings

In other additional claims, such as a claim against a third party, the defendant may make an additional claim without the court’s permission by issuing an appropriate claim form before or at the same time as they file a defence. Particulars of the additional claim must be contained in or served with the additional claim.

#### Permission

If an additional claim is not issued at that time, the court’s permission will be required. The application for permission can be made without notice, unless the court directs otherwise. If permission is needed, must give the court all the details, including a summary of the facts. The court will then consider the application in light of (r 20.9(2)):

1. Connection between additional claim and original
2. Whether substantially the same remedy is sought
3. Whether the additional claim involves more parties getting involved.

### Service (r 20.8)

> [!statute] r 20.8 - Service of a Part 20 claim form
> (1) Where a Part 20 claim may be made without the court’s permission, the Part 20 claim form must—
> - (a) in the case of a counterclaim, be served on every other party when a copy of the defence is served;
> - (b) in the case of any other Part 20 claim, be served on the person against whom it is made within 14 days after the date on which the party making the Part 20 claim files his defence.
> 
> (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a claim for contribution or indemnity made in accordance with rule 20.6.
> 
> (3) Where the court gives permission to make a Part 20 claim it will at the same time give directions as to the service of the Part 20 claim. 

### Judgment in Default (r 20.11)

Special rules apply where the additional claim is not a counterclaim or a claim by a defendant for an indemnity or contribution against another defendant under r 20.6.

> [!statute] r 20.11
> (1) This rule applies if—
> - (a) the Part 20 claim is not—
> 	- (i) a counterclaim; or
> 	- (ii) a claim by a defendant for contribution(GL) or indemnity(GL) against another defendant under rule 20.6; and
> - (b) the party against whom a Part 20 claim is made fails to file an acknowledgment of service or defence in respect of the Part 20 claim.
> 
> (2) The party against whom the Part 20 claim is made—
> - (a) is deemed to admit the Part 20 claim, and is bound by any judgment or decision in the main proceedings in so far as it is relevant to any matter arising in the Part 20 claim;
> - (b) subject to paragraph (3), if default judgment under Part 12 is given against the Part 20 claimant, the Part 20 claimant may obtain judgment in respect of the Part 20 claim by filing a request in the relevant practice form.

### Directions (r 20.13)

If a defence is filed to an additional claim (other than a counterclaim), the court will arrange a hearing to give directions as to the future conduct of the case.

### Title of Proceedings

The title of every additional claim should include both the full name of each party and their status in the proceedings.

## Drafting Counterclaim

- When drafting the defence and counterclaim together, subdivide into two sections and continue the paragraph numbering through.
- Make sure the paragraph numbering makes sense by itself.
- End with “and the defendant counterclaims”
- Make sure the counterclaim makes self as a self-standing claim, but fine to cross reference.
