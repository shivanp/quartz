# Commencing Proceedings

```toc
```

## Choice of Court

### Value of Claim

```ad-statute
title: PD 7A para 2.1
Proceedings may not be started in the High Court unless the value of the claim is $>£100,000$. 
```

So for claims worth $>£100,000$, there is often a choice of whether to start the claim in the High Court or County Court.

When to choose High Court:

```ad-statute
title: PD 7A para 2.4
A claim should be started in the High Court if by reason of:
(1) the financial value of the claim and the amount in dispute, and/or
(2) the complexity of the facts, legal issues, remedies or procedures involved, and/or
(3) the importance of the outcome of the claim to the public in general,
the claimant believes that the claim ought to be dealt with by a High Court judge.
```

### County Court

For a claim only for an amount of money, with no special procedures required, the claim form must be sent to the County Court Money Claims Centre (PD 7A para 4A.1).

| Type of claim                                                                                          | Where to send                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A claim only for an amount of money, with no special procedures required                               | the claim form must be sent to the County Court Money Claims Centre (PD 7A para 4A.1) |
| Claim for which a hearing is required                                                                  | D's home County Court or claimant's preferred hearing centre if specified.            |
| Specified claim for $<£100,000$, where there is 1 claimant, no more than 2 D's and jurisdiction is E&W | Money Claim Online                                                                    |
| Unspecified claim                                                                                      | Any County Court hearing centre of claimant's choice.                                                                                      |

### High Court

The High Court has three divisions, namely:

1. [[Queen's Bench Division]];
	- Damages for breach of contract or tort.
	- See [Guide to Litigation](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/QB-Guide-2022-Final-3-Feb-22-with-bookmarks.pdf)
	- Some Business and Property Courts come under QBD, including Commercial Court.
2. [[Chancery Division]]; and
	- Trusts, land, probate business, partnership claims…
3. [[Family Division]].

### Transfer Between Courts

Part 30 of the CPR 1998 deals with the powers of the High Court and County Court to send matters from one court to another.

## Issuing Proceedings

A party who wishes to start proceedings must complete a Claim Form in the prescribed way (PD 7A, para 3.1).

Proceedings are commenced when the court ‘issues’ the claim form by sealing it with the court seal (although for limitation purposes, the relevant date is the date when the court receives the claim form).

### Completing Claim Form

The general rule is that the Claim Form will be served by the court unless the Claimant notifies the court that they want to serve it themselves.

Increasingly in practice you will find that the Claimant will want to serve the Claim Form, so that they have control over exactly when and how the Claim Form is served. In which case, they will also need to file a Certificate of Service with the court as evidence that they have served the Claim Form. In either case, you will need to consider where the Claim Form must be served.

```ad-statute
title: PD 16 para 2 - Claim Form
**2.1** Rule 16.2 refers to matters which the claim form must contain. Where the claim is for money, the claim form must also contain the statement of value referred to in rule 16.3.

**2.2** The claim form must include an address at which the claimant resides or carries on business. This paragraph applies even though the claimant's address for service is the business address of his solicitor.

**2.3** Where the defendant is an individual, the claimant should (if he is able to do so) include in the claim form an address at which the defendant resides or carries on business. This paragraph applies even though the defendant’s solicitors have agreed to accept service on the defendant’s behalf.

**2.4** Any address which is provided for the purpose of these provisions must include a postcode or its equivalent in any EEA state (if applicable), unless the court orders otherwise. Postcode information for the United Kingdom may be obtained from www.royalmail.com or the Royal Mail Address Management Guide.

**2.5** If the claim form does not show a full address, including postcode, at which the claimant(s) and defendant(s) reside or carry on business, the claim form will be issued but will be retained by the court and will not be served until the claimant has supplied a full address, including postcode, or the court has dispensed with the requirement to do so. The court will notify the claimant.

**2.6** The claim form must be headed with the title of the proceedings, including the full name of each party. The full name means, in each case where it is known:
- (a) in the case of an individual, his full unabbreviated name and title by which he is known;
- (b) in the case of an individual carrying on business in a name other than his own name, the full unabbreviated name of the individual, together with the title by which he is known, and the full trading name (for example, John Smith ‘trading as’ or ‘T/as’ ‘JS Autos’);
- (c) in the case of a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership (LLP)) –
	- (i) where partners are being sued in the name of the partnership, the full name by which the partnership is known, together with the words ‘(A Firm)’; or
	- (ii) where partners are being sued as individuals, the full unabbreviated name of each partner and the title by which he is known;
- (d) in the case of a company or limited liability partnership registered in England and Wales, the full registered name, including suffix (plc, limited, LLP, etc), if any;
- (e) in the case of any other company or corporation, the full name by which it is known, including suffix where appropriate.
```

```ad-question
title: When can a claimant seek anonymity?
CPR 1998, r 39.2(4) provides that the court must order that the identity of any party (or witness) shall not be disclosed if, and only if, it considers non-disclosure necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interests of that party (or witness).
```

#### Brief Details of Claim

Keep it concise and specify the remedy the claimant is seeking.

#### Value Claimed

Rule 16.2(1)(cc): where the claimant’s only claim is for a specified sum, the Claim Form must contain a statement of the interest accrued on that sum.

Rule 16.3(2): claim form must state the amount claimed or, if the claim is for an unspecified sum, whether the claimant expects to recover:

1. $\leq £10,000$
2. $£10,000 < S \leq £25,000$
3. $>£25,000$
4. Cannot say

Note these correspond to small claims/ fast track or multi-track.

#### High Court

Practice Direction 7A, para 3.6 provides that if a claim for an unspecified sum of money is started in the High Court, the claim form must:

1. state that the claimant expects to recover more than $£100,000$; or
2. state that some enactment provides that the claim may only be commenced in the High Court and specify that enactment; or
3. state that the claim is to be in one of the specialist High Court lists (see CPR 1998, Parts 49 and 58–62) and specify that list.

#### Court Fee

The claimant is obliged to pay a fee on issue of the claim form, based on the value of the claim. The amount of the fee should be stated on the front of the form.

#### Solicitor's Costs

To be included, see Part 45 CPR. If the claim is for an unspecified amount, write 'to be assessed'.

#### Particulars of Claim

Set out either:

- in the claim form itself, or
- in a separate document that is served either with the claim form or
- within 14 days of service of the claim form.

File with the court within seven days of service on the defendant (r 7.4(3)).

#### Statement of Truth

Who can sign?

```ad-statute
title: PD 22, para 3.1
In a statement of case, a response or an application notice, the statement of truth must be signed by:
(1) the party or his litigation friend, or
(2) the legal representative of the party or litigation friend.
```

Precedent drafting is given by PD 22 para 2.1:

> [I believe] [The (claimant or as may be) believes] that the facts stated in this [name document being verified] are true. I understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.

Date the statement as the day it is signed (para 2.5).

##### Signing by the Client

| Party       | Who can sign                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual  | Should sign in their own name, and add 'I am duly authorised by the [party] to sign this statement'                                                                         |
| Partnership | Any of the partners can sign, or a person having control/ management of the business (PD 22 para 3.6) |
| Company     | Someone holding a senior position in the company - PD 22 para 3.4 (e.g., director, treasurer, secretary, CEO, manager - para 3.5).                                                                                                       |

##### Signed by Solicitor

Sign “The [party] believes…". PD 22 para 3.7: the statement refers to the client's belief and not the solicitor's belief.

The solicitor must state the capacity in which they sign and the name of their firm.

```ad-note
PD 22, para 3.10: the solicitor must sign in their own name and not that of their firm.
```

###### Implications of Solicitor Signing

```ad-statute
title: PD 22 para 3.8
When a legal representative signs a statement of truth, they are representing:
(1) that the client on whose behalf he has signed had authorised him to do so;
(2) that before signing he had explained to the client that in signing the statement of truth he would be confirming the client’s belief that the facts stated in the document were true; and
(3) that before signing he had informed the client of the possible consequences to the client if it should subsequently appear that the client did not have an honest belief in the truth of those facts.
```

##### Statement Omission Consequences

PD 22 para 4: if a statement of case (which includes a claim form) is not verified by a

statement of truth, it remains effective unless the court strikes it out, which the court may do on its own initiative or on the application of another party.

## Parties to Proceedings

### Individuals of Full Age

If the claimant and defendant are both individuals of full age, suing or being sued in their personal capacity, there are no special considerations.

### Children & Protected Parties

A child is a person aged under 18, and a protected party is a person who is incapable of managing and administering their own affairs (including court proceedings) because of a mental disorder, as defined by the Mental Capacity Act 2005.

Part 21 CPR contains special provisions:

#### Litigation Friend

- The Rules require a protected party to have a litigation friend to conduct proceedings, whether as claimant or defendant, on their behalf.
	- This will be a person authorised under MCA 2005 to conduct legal proceedings on their behalf
	- If unsure, solicitor can seek a court order for a hearing + medical expert to confirm ([[Lindsay v Wood [2006] EWHC 2895 (QB)]])
	- A solicitor’s retainer will not necessarily automatically terminate where a client loses mental capacity ([[Blankley v Central Manchester and Manchester Children’s University Hospitals NHS Trust [2015] EWCA Civ 18]])
- A child must also have a litigation friend to conduct proceedings on their behalf, unless the court orders otherwise.
	- Usually parent/ guardian.

No applications against child/ protected party can be made except serving claim form and applying for appointment of litigation friend, without the permission of the court.

#### Friend Responsibilities

A person authorised under the 2005 Act to act as a litigation friend on behalf of a protected party must file an official copy of the document which is their authority to act/ certificate of suitability.

##### Certificate of Suitability

Should state that LF:

- Consents to act
- Believes the party to be a child/ protected party
- Can fairly and competently conduct proceedings
- Has no adverse interest
- If for claimant, undertakes to pay their costs.

The litigation friend must serve the certificate of suitability on every person on whom the claim form should be served.

#### Cessation

| Party           | Cessation of LF appointment |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Child           | When child turns 18         |
| Protected party | Does not cease when party ceases to be protected, but continues until ended by court order (sought by any party)                            |

#### Settling Cases Against child/PP

A settlement against a child/ PP is not valid until approved by the court.

- Court must be given details about
	- Whether/ to what extend D admits liability
	- Age + occupation of child/ PP
	- That LF approves the settlement.
- In most cases, must be supported by a legal opinion on the merits of the settlement.
- Formal approval usually given publicly in open court.
- If proceedings issued solely for court approval of such a settlement, claim must be made under Part 8 CPR.
- If money recovered for child/ PP, usually paid into High Court for investment.

```ad-question
title: Is a consent judgment involving a protected party without the appointment of LF/ approval of court, where the protected party's lack of capacity unknown to everyone acting in the litigation, valid?
No, [[Dunhill (a protected party by her litigation friend Paul Tasker) v Burgin [2014] UKSC 18]]
```

#### Partnerships

- Partnerships must normally sue in the name of the firm, rather than by naming individual partners.
- Partnerships must normally be sued in the name of the firm rather than in the names of the individual partners.
- Practice Direction 7A, para 5A.3: where a partnership has a name, unless it is inappropriate to do so, claims must be brought against the partnership name at time of accrual of cause of action.
- The advantage of suing partners in their firm’s name is the ability to enforce the judgment against partnership property,
- The disadvantage is the need to seek the court’s permission to enforce a judgment against persons not identified in the proceedings as partners ([[Kommalage v Sayanthakumar [2015] EWCA Civ 1832]])

#### Sole Trader

- Sole traders should sue in their own name and not in any trading or business name.
- PD 7A, para 5C.2: sole traders carrying on business within the jurisdiction and under a name other than their own can be sued in that name.
- If the claimant does not know the name of the sole trader, the claimant may sue naming the defendant under their business name.

#### Ltd Company

A company can sue and be sued under its corporate name.

#### Unnamed Parties

Permissible to sue an unnamed D only in very limited circumstances ([[Cameron v Liverpool Victoria Insurance Co Ltd [2019] UKSC 6]]).

#### Addition and Substitution of Parties

##### Application

```ad-statute
title: 19.4(2) CPR 1998
An application for permission to remove, add or substitute a party may be made by:
(a) an existing party; or
(b) a person who wishes to become a party.
```

- The application may be made without notice and must be supported by evidence.
- Nobody may be added or substituted **as a claimant** unless they have given their consent in writing and that consent has been filed with the court.

##### When

```ad-statute
title: r 19.2 CPR
(2) The court may order a person to be added as a new party if—
- (a) it is desirable to add the new party so that the court can resolve all the matters in dispute in the proceedings; or
- (b) there is an issue involving the new party and an existing party which is connected to the matters in dispute in the proceedings, and it is desirable to add the new party so that the court can resolve that issue.

(3) The court may order any person to cease to be a party if it is not desirable for that person to be a
party to the proceedings.

(4) The court may order a new party to be substituted for an existing one if—
- (a) the existing party’s interest or liability has passed to the new party; and
- (b) it is desirable to substitute the new party so that the court can resolve the matters in dispute in the proceedings.

```

Special provisions apply where parties are to be added or substituted after the end of the  
relevant limitation period–see r 19.5 for details of the necessity test.

```ad-statute
title: r 19.5
(2) The court may add or substitute a party only if—
- (a) the relevant limitation period was current when the proceedings were started; and
- (b) the addition or substitution is necessary.

(3) The addition or substitution of a party is necessary only if the court is satisfied that—
- (a) the new party is to be substituted for a party who was named in the claim form in mistake for the new party;
- (b) the claim cannot properly be carried on by or against the original party unless the new party is added or substituted as claimant or defendant; or
- (c) the original party has died or had a bankruptcy order made against him and his interest or liability has passed to the new party.
```

#### Professional Conduct

If a solicitor acts without authority of their client, they will be personally liable for costs incurred ([[Warner v Masefield [2008] EWHC 1129]]).

## Service of Claim Form

### Methods

1. Personal service;
	- Rule 6.5(3)(a) provides that a claim form is served personally on an individual by leaving it with that individual.
	- If they will not take the claim form, they should be told what the document contains, and it should be left with them or near them ([[Tseitline v Mikhelson [2015] EWHC 3065 (Comm)]]).
2. First-class post, document exchange or other service which provides for delivery on the next business day;
	- the Rules do not allow for service by second-class post or any other postal method, such as recorded delivery, unless the alternative method provides for delivery on the next working day ([[Diriye v Bojaj [2020] EWCA Civ 1400]])
3. Leaving the claim form at a specified place;
4. Through document exchange (DX)
	- If a party has given a DX box number as its address for service then that can be used to serve the claim form (PD 6A, para 2.1)
	- Where a party or their solicitor’s headed notepaper includes a DX box number, that may be used unless the party or their solicitors have indicated in writing that they are unwilling to be served by DX/ the DX number says 'not for the purposes of service'.
5. Fax or other means of electronic communication; or
	- The party to be served, or their solicitor,s must have indicated in writing a willingness to accept service by fax and also stated the fax number to which the claim form should be sent (PD 6A, para 4).
	- A party to be served by e-mail or similar electronic method must have expressly indicated in writing the e-mail address or electronic identification to which it should be sent (PD 6A, para 4)
	- PD 6A, para 4.2 requires the party who wishes to serve the claim form by e-mail or other electronic means to clarify file format/ attachment size limits etc.
6. Service on limited companies
	- Where the party to be served is a limited company, s 1139(1) CA 2006 provides that documents may be left at or posted to the registered office of the company.

### Who to Serve

General rule: any solicitor is authorised to accept service.

```ad-statute
title: CPR r 6.7
(1) Solicitor within the jurisdiction: Subject to rule 6.5(1), where –
- (a) the defendant has given in writing the business address within the jurisdiction of a solicitor as an address at which the defendant may be served with the claim form; or
- (b) a solicitor acting for the defendant has notified the claimant in writing that the solicitor is instructed by the defendant to accept service of the claim form on behalf of the defendant at a business address within the jurisdiction,

the claim form must be served at the business address of that solicitor.
```

If parties’ solicitors have been in correspondence before litigation starts, it is usual for the  
claimant’s solicitors to ask the defendant’s solicitors if they are ‘authorised to accept service of  
proceedings’.

See also:

| Provision | Concerns                                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| r 6.11    | Contractually agreed method of service        |
| r 6.12    | Service on the agent of an overseas principal |
| r 6.15    | Service by an alternative method or at an alternative place in accordance with court order.                                              |

Under r 6.15(2), the court has power to order that an alternate method of service already taken is good service. But they are usually reluctant to do so: standards will not be lowered for a claimant in person ([[Barton v Wright Hassall LLP [2018] UKSC 12]]) and there is no duty requiring solicitors to draw attention to the mistake made by the other party in serving a claim, for which they were not responsible ([[Woodward v Phoenix Healthcare Distribution Ltd [2019] EWCA Civ 985]]).

### Where to Serve

| Nature of defendant to be served                                        | Place of service                                                                                                                                                          |

| 3. Individual being sued in the business name of a partnership          | Usual or last known residence of the individual; or principal or last known place of business of the partnership.                                                         |
| 4. Limited liability partnership                                        | Principal office of the partnership; or any place of business of the partnership within the jurisdiction which has a real connection with the claim.                      |
| 5. Corporation (other than a company) incorporated in England and Wales | Principal office of the corporation; or any place within the jurisdiction where the corporation carries on its activities and which has a real connection with the claim. |
| 6. Company registered in England and Wales                              | Principal office of the company; or any place of business of the company within the jurisdiction which has a real connection with the claim.                              |
| 7. Any other company or corporation                                     | Any place within the jurisdiction where the corporation carries on its activities; or any place of business of the company within the jurisdiction.                       |

#### Reasonable Steps

If a claimant has reason to believe that the address above is not the current address of D, they must take reasonable steps to ascertain D's address or place of business (6.9(3)).

#### Dispensing Service Requirement

In exceptional circumstances the court can dispense with service of the claim form under r 6.16(1), e.g., [[Lonestar Communications Corp LLC v Kaye & Ors [2019] EWHC 3008 (Comm)]].

### When to Serve

By r 7.5(1), a claimant who wishes to serve a claim form in the jurisdiction must complete the steps required **before 12.00 midnight on the calendar day four months after the date of issue of the claim form**.

### Deemed Service

```ad-important
Rule 6.14 introduces a simple, indisputable presumption that the claim form is deemed to have been served on the second business day after the step set out above has occurred.
```

r 6.2(b): ‘business day’ here means any day except Saturday, Sunday, a bank holiday, Good Friday or Christmas Day.

### Who Serves

Court usually serves by first class post, except for when (r 6.4(1)):

1. a rule or Practice Direction provides that the claimant must serve the claim form; or
2. the claimant notifies the court that they want to serve it; or
3. the court orders or directs otherwise.

#### Undelivered Claim

```ad-statute
title: r 6.18 CPR
(1) Where –
- (a) the court serves the claim form by post; and
- (b) the claim form is returned to the court,

the court will send notification to the claimant that the claim form has been returned.

(2) The claim form will be deemed to be served unless the address for the defendant on the claim form is not the relevant address for the purpose of rules 6.7 to 6.10.
```

#### After Service

```ad-statute
title: r 6.17(2) CPR - Certificate of service
Where the claimant serves the claim form, the claimant –
- (a) must file a certificate of service within 21 days of service of the particulars of claim, unless all the defendants to the proceedings have filed acknowledgments of service within that time; and
- (b) may not obtain judgment in default under Part 12 unless a certificate of service has been filed.
```

#### Service Out of Jurisdiction

| Type of cases                                       | Process                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cases governed by 2005 Hague Convention or contract | No special requirement to serve proceedings outside of E&W |
| All other cases                                     | Claimant must obtain permission to serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction.                                                            |

## Extending Time for Service

The court has a general discretion to extend the period in which a claimant has to serve a Claim Form, from the state of issue.

- Ideally, apply for extension before deadline
- If not, court still has discretion, but will need to be satisfied that:
	- The court has been unable to serve the claim form; **or**
	- Claimant has taken all reasonable steps to serve the claim form but has been unable to do so; **and**
	- Claimant has acted promptly in making the application.

r 2.11:

> ‘Unless these Rules or a practice direction provide otherwise or the court orders otherwise, the time specified by a rule or by the court for a person to do any act may be varied by the written agreement of the parties.’

So the parties' solicitors can enter into a written agreement to extend the time for service of the claim form.

## Service of Other Documents

Same as claim forms for how to serve, who to serve and where to serve - see rules 6.20-6.29.
