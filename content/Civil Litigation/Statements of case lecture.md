# Statements of case lecture

## Scope

Statements of case include:

- Claim forms
- Particulars of claim
- Defences
- Counterclaims
- Replies

But not witness evidence or expert evidence.

## Claim Form Formalities

![[CPR-paras.png]]

- To bring a claim at the High Court, needs to be valued at £100,000+ (lower for a personal injury claim).
- Financial complexity and public importance should also be taken into account.
- 3 subdivisions of the High Court – which is most appropriate?

For County Court, can be heard at any County Court.

D must be properly named. Wrongly naming the party can cause difficulties. D's own address goes in the claim form, not that of the solicitor.

Brief details of claim: very brief.

### Statement of Value

Value: this is an administrative exercise, really to categorise into the correct court. Depends on whether claim is specified or unspecified, and whether interest is claimed either as of right or at the discretion of the court.

- Specified claim: precise amount of money due to the claimant as of right (e.g., contractual debt claim)
- Unspecified claim: amount of money decided by the court (e.g., claim for damages).
- If mixed, treated as unspecified.

Value must be specified in bands, corresponding to the different tracks.

- Interest on a contractual debt specified in the contract is as of right.
- Interest claimed on damages is interest awarded by the court at their discretion.
- Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998: implies a term into the relevant debt agreement as to interest.

Claim can request a particular county court.

## Financial Aspects

The figure used for calculating court fees should include interest, says form EX50. But interest is at the discretion of the court? This appears to be a conflict, for which there is little official guidance. Regard as serving different purposes. Claimant must put in the box what they genuinely expect to recover.

Total amount will be indeterminate if claim is unspecified.

## Part 45: Fixed Costs

Only relevant to certain types of claim, particularly specified claims.

Fixed costs will not necessarily ever become payable, even for a specified claim. Only payable if:

- D admits liability
- V obtains summary judgment
- V obtains judgment in default.

Fixed costs payable set out in tables – all amounts fairly small.

## Particulars of Claim

Either put it on the claim form if v small, otherwise use a separate form.

Recall can have 'particulars of claim to follow' within 14 days. A copy must then be filed at the court within 7 days of such service.

## Statement of Truth

The safest option is to have the claimant sign the statement of truth.

PD 22 para 3: solicitor can sign, but the belief refers to the belief of the claimant, not the solicitor. The client must have been told of the consequences of the Statement of Truth being false.

```ad-question
title: What if the claimant is a company?


Company cannot believe! Director believes, they sign in their name. "I am duly authorised by the claimant to sign this statement" - not required but usually added for clarity. 
```

If no particulars of claim are made, technically no need to sign statement of truth… but do it anyway. Remember to include a file reference on the personal details page 4.

## Court Document Formalities

PD 5A para 2: documents drafted by a legal representative should bear their signature, or the name of the firm if employee.

PD 7A para 4.1: title of statement of case

PD 16 para 13.3: attachments to statement of case. Use sparingly.

Specific courts usually have specific guidance.

Good drafting – Make sure you always comply with the client's instructions.

### Purpose of PoC

Bare bones – material facts only.

### Structure

Most POCs have a particular structure – check details before drafting.

#### Contract

![[contract-particulars.png]]

Use the word 'purported' performance to signal this has gone wrong.

Start with a general breach. And then a 'particulars of breach' – in particular, D got this wrong.

Numbering: particulars of allegation will generally form the same number as an allegation and not be numbered as a new paragraph.

Usual to create a numbered sub-list.

Distinguish between the actual breach and the consequences of breach.

#### Negligence

![[tort-particulars.png]]

Prayer for relief: comes right at the end, not necessary but a long-standing convention to include this.

## Claiming Interest

### Unspecified Claims

Typical wording:

> The Claimant claims interest on damages under [statutory provision] at such rate and for such period as the court sees fit.

### Specified Claim

- Debt claims: amount known precisely
- Usually possible to calculate precise interest.
	- CPR requires certain pieces of information to be given. - see CPR 16.4
	- Include daily rate at which interest accrues after the date of breach.

## Defence

Must deal explicitly with every point which is denied/ evidence asked for.

Non-admission should be used for things which D has no knowledge of these matters.

Use particulars of claim as a checklist. Even trivial or uncontentious points are technically allegations. Could be more than one allegation in any given paragraph of the particulars of claim. If an allegation is not addressed it is taken to be admitted.

Silence = admission.

## Counterclaims

- D makes the case within ongoing proceedings as a counterclaim.
- For drafting purposes, this is just a claim.
- Should include counterclaim in same document as defence.
