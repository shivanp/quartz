# Crown Court

- Senior court of first instance in the **criminal** law
- Will hear '**indictable only**' (v serious) offences.
	- These can only be tried in the Crown Court, because they are too serious for the sentencing powers of the Magistrates.
	- Note that these cases still start in [[Magistrates' Court]], which decide whether to grant bail and consider other procedural issues such as reporting restrictions, before passing the case onto Crown Court for trial.
- Also hears 'either way' offences transferred from the Magistrates' Court.
- Trials in the Crown Court involve juries in almost all cases.
- The Crown Court is administered by an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice called **HM Courts and Tribunals Service**.
- It sits in ~80 locations around England and Wales, the most famous of which is the Old Bailey (Central Criminal Court)

## Functions

1. To try, convict and sentence offenders convicted of indictable-only and some either-way offences.
2. To determine questionss of bail and representation, particularly appeals by a defendant against the refusal of bail by the magistrates' court
3. To hear appeals against conviction and/or sentencing from the magistrates' court.

Proceedings are by judge and, if the case goes to trial, before a judge and jury. Most cases are heard before a Circuit Judge. Particularly high profile cases are heard before a High Court Judge.

If an appeal against sentence, the judge will sit with 2-4 magistrates.

Advocacy is predominantly done by barristers. Solicitors have very limited rights of audience, though it is possible to achieve full rights of audience.
