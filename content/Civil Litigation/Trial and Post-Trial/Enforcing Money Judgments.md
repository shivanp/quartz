# Enforcing Money Judgments

## Introduction

Once a party has obtained a judgment against their opponent, the opponent will usually pay the amount ordered without any further enforcement action necessary. If they do not, the receiving party can take enforcement action.

If the opponent is not insured, enforcement should be considered before proceedings are commenced, since it is not worth obtaining a judgment against a party who does not have means to pay.

A client may be able to claim under the terms of their own household insurance for an unsatisfied judgment in respect of personal injury, damage to property or a fatal accident claim.

### Partnership Property

Practice Direction 70, para 6A.1 provides that a judgment made against a partnership may be enforced against any property of the partnership within the jurisdiction.

A judgment against a partnership can be enforced against any partner if the partner:

- Acknowledged service of the claim form as partner
- Failed to acknowledge service of the claim form, having being served as partner
- Admitted in their statement that they were a partner at the material time
- Found by the court to have been a partner at the material time.

Proceedings can be taken against partnership property for a partner’s separate judgment  
debt (s 23 Partnership Act 1890).

## Interest on Judgment Debts

### High Court Judgments

Interest accrues on all High Court judgments from the date judgment is pronounced at 8% pa (Judgments Act 1838).

- Where judgment is entered for damages to be assessed, interest begins to run from the date when damages are finally assessed or agreed
- Interest on an order for the payment of costs runs from the date of the judgment, not from the date of the final costs certificate following a detailed assessment (so make a payment on account).

### County Court Judgments

- s 74 of the CCA 1984, interest accrues on County Court judgments of £5,000 or more, at 8% pa.
- Where payment is deferred/ by instalments, interest will not accrue until that date/ until an instalment falls due.
- Where enforcement proceedings are taken, the judgment debt ceases to carry interest unless the enforcement proceedings fail to produce any payment, in which case interest will continue to accrue on the judgment debt as if the enforcement proceedings had never been issued.
- If enforcement proceedings are taken and anything at all is recovered, the balance of the debt will become interest free.

## Tracing Other Party

Consider employing an enquiry agent to trace the other party, with a limit on the costs that may be incurred by them. Enquiries likely to be made at the outset of the case.

## Investigating Debtor's Means

To investigate the judgment debtor's assets, either:

1. Instruct an enquiry agent, or
	- Likely to be quicker but more expensive than applying to court.
2. Apply to the court for an order to obtain information from the judgment debtor.
	- Part 71
	- This is a court order requiring the judgment debtor to attend before an officer of the court to be examined on oath as to their means.
	- To make an application:
		- Judgment creditor filed form N316 (for individual debtor) or N316A (officer of company/ corporation is to be questioned).
		- PD 71 para 1 sets out matters to be contained in the application notice (name and address of debtor, judgment sought to be enforced, amount owed).
		- r 71.3 & 71.4 procedure for service of the order and for payment of the judgment debtor's travel expenses.
	- Hearing
		- County Court hearing centre near to debtor
		- Conducted by officer of court/ judge
		- Standard questions asked if officer of court; the creditor can also add some in their application notice/ ask in person.
		- Fixed costs may be awarded if solicitor attends hearing (r 45.8)
		- Judge will not use standard questions, meeting will be tape recorded, judge may make a summary assessment (r 44.6)
		- If debtor fails to attend/ take an oath/ answer questions, a committal order may be made against them.

Recall that pre-action it is usual to make bankruptcy/ company searches.

A person can be compelled for examination as a judgment debtor if the only outstanding parts of the judgment against them are costs orders for sums which have yet to be agreed or determined by the assessment ([[Nagel (a firm) v Pluczenik Diamond Company NV [2019] EWHC 3126 (QB)]]).

## Enforcement Methods

4 common methods:

1. Seizure and sale of debtor's goods
2. Charging order (charge over debtor's land/ securities)
3. Third party debt order (requiring 3rd party owing debtor money to pay it directly to the creditor)
4. Attachment of earnings order (requiring debtor's employer to make payments direct to the creditor).

### Taking Control of Goods

- Part 83: allows an enforcement agent/ officer to seize and sell the debtor's personal goods to pay the judgment debt and costs.
- Sold at public auction.
- Cannot force entry into the debtor's home, though can break into business premises.
- Choice of court
	- A party who obtained judgment in the High Court may issue a writ of control in that court.
	- Where a party has obtained judgment in the County Court, and the amount to be enforced is £5,000 or more, it must be enforced in the High Court unless the proceedings originated under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
	- Where the sum to be enforced is less than £600, it must be enforced in a County Court.
	- So for $£600 \leq P < £5,000$, judgment creditor can elect the court. If choosing High Court, the County Court judgment must first be transferred to the High Court, but this has the advantage that interest accrues on the judgment debt.
	- To enforce in the County Court, the party must apply for a warrant of control.
- Exempt items
	- Goods on hire or hire-purchase
	- Tools, books, phones, computers, vehicles and other items necessary for the debtor to use personally in their job/ trade/ profession/ study, subject to £1,350 maximum aggregate value
	- Clothing, bedding, furniture etc. reasonably required for satisfying basic domestic needs of the debtor and their family.
	- Exemptions only apply to judgment debts against individuals.
	- Usually motor vehicles can be seized, as can household items such as stereos, TVs etc.
	- Control may be taken by goods owned by the judgment debtor jointly with another person (common law).
- Controlled goods agreement
	- Usually the debtor enters into an agreement, where the enforcement officer agrees not to remove the goods at once, and the debtor agrees not to dispose of them or permit them to be moved. Gives the debtor a further opportunity to pay the sum due.

### Charging Order on Land

A judgment creditor may apply to the court for an order charging the judgment debtor's land with the amount due under a judgment. A charging order can also be made in respect of land the debtor owns jointly with another person (charge upon the debtor’s beneficial interest).

- Restrictions
	- Where there is a plan in place for the debtor to pay a sum by instalments, a charging order can be made even though there has been no default in payments.
	- The court must take the lack of default into account in deciding whether or not to make the order.
- Registration
	- When a charging order has been made, should be registered if possible (at the Land Registry).
	- Where the land is jointly owned, the debtor technically has an interest only in the proceeds of sale under the trust for sale, rather than an interest in the land itself. This should be protected by a restriction on the register.
- Notice
	- Whether or not the charging order is registered, written notice of it should be given to any prior chargee(s) to prevent any tacking of later advances.
- Order for sale
	- To obtain the money, the creditor can apply to the court for an order for sale of the land charged.
	- The judgment will then be satisfied out of the proceeds of sale.

### Charging Order of Securities

- A judgment creditor may also obtain a charging order on a judgment debtor’s beneficial interest in certain specified securities.
- The court may order that the charge extends to any dividend that is payable.
- Apply with Form N380

### Third Party Debt Orders

- Where a third party owes money to the judgment debtor, the court can make an order requiring that third party to pay the judgment creditor the whole of that debt, or such part of it as is sufficient to satisfy the judgment debt and costs.
- The debt must belong to the judgment debtor solely and beneficially. An order cannot be made against joint debts unless all the people owed the debt are joint judgment debtors.
- The third party must be within the jurisdiction.
- Choice of court
	- Generally, County Court hearing centre.
- Costs
	- Costs are fixed (Part 45) and may be retained out of money recovered from the 3rd party.

### Attachment of Earnings

An attachment of earnings order is an order which compels the judgment debtor’s employer to make regular deductions from the debtor’s earnings and pay them into court. The High Court has no power to make an attachment of earnings order. If the judgment has been obtained in the High Court, the proceedings will have to be transferred to the County Court before this method of enforcement can be used.

#### Conditions

- The amount remaining due under the judgment must be at least £50
- The debtor must be employed (not self-employed)
- Debtor must be an individual.

### Insolvency

Where the judgment debt is for £5,000 or more, the judgment creditor may decide to petition for bankruptcy of the judgment debtor. However, they will not be able to do this if they have already registered a charging order because they are then in the position of a secured creditor, and a secured creditor cannot petition for bankruptcy unless they give up their security.

If a bankruptcy order is made, all the debtor’s property vests in the trustee in bankruptcy.

### Winding up

If the judgment debtor is a company, the judgment creditor may consider winding up the company if the debt is £750 or more.
