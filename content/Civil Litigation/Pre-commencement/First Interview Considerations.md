# First Interview Considerations

## Purpose

Solicitor needs to:

- Identify client objectives
- Explain issues and options
- Agree next steps

```ad-defn
The scope of the work to be done for the client is formally known as the solicitor's "retainer".  
```

## Professional Conduct

### Duty of Confidentiality

```ad-statute
title: Para 6.3 Code for Solicitors
A solicitor is under a duty to maintain the confidentiality of their client's affairs except the client's prior authority is obtained to disclose particular information, or if the solicitor is required or permitted by law to do so. 
```

If a solicitor holds confidential information on (former) client A, they should not risk breaching confidentiality by acting, or continuing to act, for another client (B) on a matter where:

- that information might reasonably be expected to be material and
- client B has an interest adverse to client A.

See [[Professional Conduct and Regulation 1#Ch 12 LF Confidentiality]].

### Conflict of Interest

A solicitor should not act for two or more clients where this would cause a conflict of interest.

```ad-defn
A conflict of interests exists if the
solicitor owes separate duties to act in the best interests of two or more clients in relation to the same or related matters, and those duties conflict or there is a significant risk that those duties may conflict.
```

See [[Professional Conduct and Regulation 1#Ch 13 LF Conflicts of Interest]].

### Money Laundering

See [[Professional Conduct and Regulation 2#Ch 15 Money Laundering]].

```ad-question
title: A solicitor should ask: 
Who is my client and am I authorised to act?
```

### Officer of Court

The solicitor has an overriding duty not to mislead the court (para 1.4 Code for Solicitors). The solicitor must disclose all relevant legal authorities to the court, even if these are not favourable to their case.

A solicitor must be mindful of their core duties and abide by SRA principles.

## Funding

Discuss costs with the clients, including advising the client of different types of funding available.

The solicitor should explain potential costs given potential steps of litigation and agree on a ceiling figure and review dates. It is unusual for there to be a fixed fee – this can be the case for taking some specific step (e.g., attending a hearing).

If a solicitor fixes their fee too low, tough. Still obliged to complete work to the ordinary standard of care ([[Inventors Friend Ltd v Leathes Prior (a firm) [2011] EWHC 711]]).

If you don't give clients regular cost information, can be bound by original costs estimate ([[Reynolds v Stone Rowe Brewer [2008] EWHC 497]]).

### Types of Costs

The solicitor should explain the distinction between solicitor and client costs, and the costs that may be awarded between parties in litigation.

```ad-statute
title: r 44.2(2)(a) CPR 1998
As a general rule the unsuccessful party in litigation will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party.
```

If a client wins the case, they will still have to pay their own solicitor's costs, and then they will receive their costs from the opponent. But it is normal for the costs awarded to be less than the actual legal cost paid.

Even if successful, the court has the power to reduce costs to reflect any unreasonable conduct on the part of the successful party ([[Benyatov v Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd [2022] WL 00509179]]).

### Contingency Fee Arrangements

```ad-defn
title: Contingency fee arrangement
The client only pays a fee if they are successful.
```

These used to be completely illegal – solicitors could only charge clients on a time basis. Currently, only two types are legal:

- Conditional fee arrangement
- Damages-based agreement.

### Conditional Fee Arrangements

```ad-defn
title: Conditional fee arrangement (CFA)
‘An agreement with a person providing advocacy or litigation services which provides for his fees and expenses, or any part of them, to be payable only in specified circumstances’ - s 58(2)(a) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (CLSA 1990)
```

(Circumstances are winning the case).

Note they can be 'no win, no fee', but also 'no win, less fee'. Any fee payable is based on the solicitor's usual hourly charging rates, up to a maximum of 100% extra. So maximum you can charge is 200% of normal fee.  

A CFA is enforceable only if it meets the requirements of ss 58 and 58A of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. These provide that a CFA:

- (a) may be entered into in relation to any civil litigation matter, except family proceedings;
- (b) must be in writing; and
- (c) must state the percentage by which the amount of the fee that would be payable if it were not a CFA is to be increased (the success fee).

Where it is agreed that the solicitor should receive higher than normal payment if the case is won, the success fee cannot exceed 100% of the solicitor’s normal charges. This limit is set by the CFA Order 2013 (SI 2013/689), reg 3 (although note that different provisions apply to personal injury claims).

The solicitor should explain the circumstances in which the client may be liable for their own legal costs (and when the solicitor would seek payment) and their right to an assessment of those costs. Also check if the client has before-the-event legal insurance.

The CFA is usually worded, so the solicitors' firm has a right to take enforcement action in the client's name.

#### Drafting CFA

Draft carefully, including a clear definition of 'win'. Does there need to be a threshold level of damages obtained?

#### Success Fee

If the opponent is ordered to pay costs, these cannot include the success fee, which will be payable by the client. Make this crystal.

The solicitor is taking a risk here, so they should perform a thorough risk assessment (likely damages, chances of client succeeding, likely time taken etc.). This might take time and research, and the success fee should not be set arbitrarily.

```ad-question
title: Can you accept a client suggested success fee which is exorbitant?
No:
- principle 2 - upholding public trust and confidence, 
- principle 4 - acting with honesty, 
- principle 5 - acting with integrity, 
- principle 6 - acting in best interests of client,
- para 1.2 - solicitor must not abuse their position by taking unfair advantage of the client, 
- para 8.7 - ensuring clients receive the best possible information about how their matter will be priced.
```

#### Liability for Costs

If a CFA client loses their case, they will not usually have to pay their own solicitor's fees, but will be liable for their opponent's costs including disbursements. They will also have to fund disbursements such as barrister and expert witness fees.

Can mitigate by purchasing after-the-event insurance (AEI). The solicitor should discuss with the client whether this is appropriate.

### Damages-based Agreement

Key statute:

```ad-statute
title: s 58AA(3)(a) CLSA 1990
An agreement between a person providing advocacy services, litigation services or claims management services and the recipient of those services which provides that—
- (i) the recipient is to make a payment to the person providing the services if the recipient obtains a specified financial benefit in connection with the matter in relation to which the services are provided, and
- (ii) the amount of that payment is to be determined by reference to the amount of the financial benefit obtained.
```

It means that if the client receives damages, the solicitor's fee is an agreed percentage of those damages.

A DBA is only enforceable if it meets the requirements of s 58AA(4) of the CLSA 1990. These are that the agreement:

- (a) must be in writing;
- (b) must not provide for a payment above a prescribed amount or for a payment above an amount calculated in a prescribed manner;
- (c) must comply with such other requirements as to its terms and conditions as are prescribed; and
- (d) must be made only after the person providing services under the agreement has provided prescribed information.

As per Damages-Based Agreements Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/609):

- the DBA must not provide for a payment above an amount which, including VAT, is equal to 50% of the sums ultimately recovered by the client.
- This cap is inclusive of counsel fees, but not disbursements.
- Cap does not apply to any appeal proceedings.

Regulation 4 provides that the client cannot be required to pay an amount other than the agreed fee net of the following:

- (i) any costs (including fixed costs) and counsel’s fees, that have been paid or are payable by another party to the proceedings by agreement or order; and
- (ii) any expenses incurred by the solicitor after accounting for any amount which has been paid or is payable by another party to the proceedings by agreement or order. Expenses in this context would include disbursements such as experts’ fees and court fees.

The terms and conditions of a DBA must specify:

- (i) the claim or proceedings or parts of them to which the agreement relates;
- (ii) the circumstances in which the representative’s payment, expenses and costs, or part of them, are payable; and
- (iii) the reason for setting the amount of the payment at the level agreed.

```ad-question
title: Is a DBA valid if it contains a clause which provides that the client must pay the solicitors’ normal fees and disbursements if they terminate the retainer prematurely?
Yes, see [[Zuberi v Lexlaw Ltd [2021] EWCA Civ 16]]. The case is also authority for the use of so-called ‘hybrid DBAs’. For example, a law firm may receive concurrent funding via both a DBA and some other form of retainer; this might consist of the DBA in the event of the claim’s success and discounted hourly rate fees in the event of the claim’s failure. Alternatively, a DBA might comprise one or other of the methods of funding for different stages of the legal proceedings.
```

```ad-warning
Slightly different provisions for the DBA for personal injury claims/ employment matters.
```

### Insurance

The solicitor should check if the client has before-the-event (BEI) insurance, which might fund the litigation. This is commonly part of household/ motor insurance.

Discuss with the client whether litigation is covered on existing policy, or if AEI should be purchased. Often a very good option. A solicitor who fails to discuss the possibility of such insurance may be negligent and in breach of professional insurance.

### Third Party Funding

Trade union or organisational funding available? Historically, commercial funding of litigation has been unlawful, but in recent years has become accepted.

### Public Funding

There are *very* limited circumstances in which public funding (legal aid) is available for civil litigation. But this usually doesn't apply (budget cuts cri).

- Administered by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA).
- Usually not available for cases that could be financed by a CFA.
- Claims in negligence for personal injury, death or damage to property are excluded, as are claims brought or defended by sole traders.
- Only available if financially eligible and a cost-benefit analysis will be carried out.
- A contribution from income could be required towards costs. This is payable monthly for as long as the claim is funded by the LAA.

In [[David Truex, Solicitor (a firm) v Kitchin [2007] EWCA Civ 618]], the Court of Appeal held that a solicitor must from the outset of a case consider whether a client might be eligible for legal aid.

#### Statutory Charge

Where a publicly-funded client recovers money from proceedings, they may have to pay some or all of their legal costs to the LAA out of the money recovered. Known as the statutory charge, and will apply to the extent costs are not recovered from the opponent.

The same principle applies to property as well a money. A solicitor must ensure that the client understands.

## Case Analysis

Recall the need to assess viability, liability, and quantum.

### Liability

- What is the cause of action?
- Is there more than one?
- Establish legal elements for the claim to succeed.

### Limitation

A solicitor must ascertain when the limitation period began and when it will expire. Continually review this.

```ad-question
title: What if claim forms are sent to the court very close to the expiration date?
Per [[St Helens Metropolitan BC v Barnes [2006] EWCA Civ 1372]], 
> Proceedings are started when the court issues a claim form at the request of the claimant (see rule 7.2) but where the claim form as issued was received in the court office on a date earlier than the date on which it was issued by the court, the claim is ‘brought’ for the purposes of the Limitation Act 1980 and
> any other relevant statute on that earlier date.
```

The Limitation Act 1980 (LA 1980) (as amended) prescribes fixed periods of time for issuing

various types of proceedings. This is important to a client because if this period of time elapses without proceedings being issued, the case becomes ‘statute-barred’. The claimant can still commence their claim, but the defendant will have an impregnable defence. If the defendant wishes to rely on this, it must be stated specifically in their defence.

### Contractual/ Tortious Claims

- The basic rule is that the claimant has six years from the date when the cause of action accrued to commence their proceedings.
	- In contract, the cause of action accrues as soon as the breach of contract occurs.
	- With an anticipatory breach of contract, the cause of action accrues when the intention not to perform the contract is made clear, and not at the later date when performance was due to occur ([[Hochester v de la Tour (1853) 2 E & B 678]])
- In tort, the cause of action accrues when the tort is committed.
	- In negligence, the cause of action accrues only when some damage occurs (this may be a later date than the breach of duty itself – think misrepresentation claims)
- The basic rule is modified for certain claims such as personal injury.

### Latent Damage

In a non-personal injury claim based on negligence, where the damage is latent at the date when the cause of action accrued, s 14A of the LA 1980 provides that the limitation period expires either:

- (a) six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or
- (b) three years from the date of knowledge of certain material facts about the damage, if this period expires after the period mentioned in (a).

Additionally, there is a long-stop limitation period of 15 years from the date of the alleged breach of duty (LA 1980, s 14B). It may bar a cause of action at a date earlier than the claimant's knowledge, or even before a cause of action has accrued.

### Person Under Disability

```ad-defn
Either a child (under 18) or a protected party (a person of unsound mind under the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 who is incapable of managing and administering their property and affairs).
```

When the claimant is a person under disability when a right of action accrues, the limitation

period does not begin to run until the claimant ceases to be under that disability.

### Contractual Limitation

Check if any limitation period is specified in the contract.

| Type of claim | Statutory limitation period |
| :--- | :--- |
| Contract (excluding personal injury) | 6 years (LA 1980,s 5) |
| Tort (excluding personal injury and latent damage) | 6 years (LA 1980, s 2) |
| Latent damage | 6 years or 3 years from date of knowledge (LA 1980,s 14A) |

### Remedies

Different remedies available – remember contract law. The most common one is damages.

```ad-defn
title: Quantum
How much D will pay to V if liability is proved (or vice versa if not).
```

### Damages

Rule as to quantum depends on the type of claim being pursued.

### Contract

A claim for damages arises when one party to the contract has failed to perform an obligation under the contract. Purpose: to put the injured party in the position they would have been in if the contract had been performed properly.

Damages must not be too remote from the breach to be recoverable.

### Tort

Injury, loss or damage is caused to the claimant or their property. Aim is to put V, as far as possible, in the position they would have been in if the damage had not occurred.

### Duty to Mitigate

Remember claimants have a duty to try to mitigate their losses. In [[Frost v Knight (1872) LR 7 Ex 111]]

the court observed that this duty means looking at what the claimant

> ‘has done, or has had the means of doing, and, as a prudent man, ought in reason to have done, whereby his loss has been, or would have been, diminished’.

### Debt

A debt action is a particular type of contract claim. The claimant is claiming a sum which D promised to pay under the contract. Note that in debt actions, V has no duty to mitigate their loss.

```ad-example
If the buyer takes delivery for goods but fails to pay, the action is for debt.
```

### Quantum

Think about the evidence you have to prove the loss. Figures or estimates?

## Viability and Burden of Proof

### Viability

Viability of a claim depends on a number of questions.

```ad-note
title: Considerations
- Who is the prospective defendant?
- Is there more than one possible defendant?
- Where is the defendant?
- Is the defendant solvent?
- Where are the defendant’s assets?
- What are those assets worth?
- Will the defendant be able to pay any judgment?
- What can the client afford to pay?
- Does the client have any suitable BEI?
- Is the case suitable for a CFA or DBA and/or AEI cover?
- Does the client qualify for public funding or require third-party funding?
- How much time and resources will the client have to commit to investigate and deal
with the case?
- Does a cost–benefit analysis suggest the desirability of a quicker and cheaper solution
than litigation can offer?
```

### Defendants and Status

The case analysis must identify against whom each cause of action lies. Recall the general rule that all persons to be sued should be sued at the same time and in the same claim.

Must ensure that each of the prospective D's are sued in their correct capacity (personally/ as a partnership/ as a director etc.).

#### D's Solvency

… check D is solvent. Do this through a company search/ bankruptcy search, Facebook stalking etc.

#### Whereabouts

D must be traceable. An inquiry agent may be helpful.

#### The Claim

Involves balancing the merits of the claim against the overall cost of pursuing it and the prospects of a successful outcome. Tell the client about the overriding objective and r 1.3 that parties must help the court to further it.

#### Alternative Remedies

Advise the client on, e.g., alternative dispute resolution.

### Burden of Proof

- Legal burden
	- The party asserting a fact must prove it unless admitted by their component.
		- e.g., claimant alleging breach of contract must prove a contract existed, that D broke terms, and loss suffered.
		- D must prove any allegation of failure to mitigate loss or contributory negligence.
- Balance of probabilities
	- Standard of proof.

## Interest

### Specified and Unspecified Claims

A claim for a fixed amount of money is a specified amount. A specified claim is in the nature of a debt, i.e., a fixed amount of money due and payable under and by virtue of a contract.

Here, the amount known will be known and fixed, or mathematically determinable.

If the court will have to conduct an investigation to decide on the amount of money payable, the claim is best seen as being for an unspecified amount, even if the claimant puts some figures forward for the amount claimed.

If mixed, classified as unspecified.

### Entitlement to Interest

Pre-action, a prospective claimant can demand interest on a claim only if entitled to it under

any contractual provision (including any provision implied by the [Late Payments of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/20/contents)).

Where the remedy sought by the claimant is damages or the repayment of a debt, the court may award interest on the sum outstanding.

#### Breach of Contract and Debt Claims

There are 3 alternative claims to interest:

1. The contract may specify a rate of interest payable on any outstanding sum – the rate negotiated by the parties.
2. May be possible to claim under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.
3. In all other cases, the court has a discretion to award interest either under s 35A of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (SCA 1981) in respect of High Court cases, or under s 69 of the County Courts Act 1984 (CCA 1984) in respect of County Court cases. The current rate of interest payable under either statute is 8% pa in non-commercial cases and, generally, 1% or 2% pa over base rate in commercial cases.

In a debt claim, interest must be claimed precisely. Give a lump sum for accrued interest from breach of contract until date of issue of proceedings, and a daily rate thereafter. In a debt claim, where s 35A of the SCA 1981 or s 69 of the CCA 1984 applies, the convention is to claim interest from and including the day after the last day payment was due.

#### Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998

This Act (as amended by the Late Payment of Commercial Debt Regulations 2013 (SI 2013/395) and the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Amendment) Regulations 2015 (SI 2015/ 1336)) gives a statutory right to interest on commercial debts that are paid late if the contract itself does not provide for interest in the event of late payment.

##### Scope

The term ‘commercial debt’ includes debts arising from the supply of goods and services. As the Act is only concerned with commercial debt, it does not apply to unspecified claims or a specified amount owed by a consumer.

##### Details

Interest under the Act can be claimed at a rate of 8% pa above the Bank of England’s reference

rate on the date the debt became due for payment. The reference rate is the base rate applicable on 31 December and 30 June each year and will apply for the following six months.

The interest accrues from the expiry of any period of credit under the contract. If the contract does

not provide for any such period, interest can be claimed from 30 days after the latest of:

- (a) delivery of the bill;
- (b) delivery of the goods;
- (c) performance of the service.

The parties may agree to extend the period from 30 days up to a maximum of 60 days. Any further extension must not be grossly unfair to the supplier.

In addition to the debt and interest, the Act also provides for payment of a fixed sum of between £40 and £100 compensation for late payment, the amount varying according to the size of the debt. In addition, the supplier may also claim as compensation any ‘reasonable’ costs of recovering

the debt that exceed the fixed sum.

#### Tort

The court has a general discretion to award interest on damages in any negligence claim. This

power is derived from SCA 1981, s 35A in respect of High Court claims, and from CCA 1984,

s 69 in respect of County Court claims. Generally speaking, if interest has been claimed properly, the court will normally exercise its discretion to award interest for such period as it considers appropriate.

#### Specifics

Though theoretically damages can be awarded from when the cause of action first arose, in practice it is normally made from when the loss is sustained. See [[Kaines (UK) Ltd v Osterreichische [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1]].

Awards of interest are compensatory in measure. Judges are a bit fluffy about them and the circumstances of the claimant; not simply the cost of finance at the time.

In [[Tate & Lyle Food and Distribution Ltd v Greater London Council [1982] 1 WLR 149]], Forbes J said:

> One looks, therefore, not at the profit which the defendant wrongly made out of the money he withheld – this would indeed involve a scrutiny of the defendant’s financial position – but at the cost to the [claimant] of being deprived of the money which he should have had. I feel satisfied that in commercial cases, the interest is intended to reflect the rate at which the [claimant] would have had to borrow money to supply the place of that which was withheld.

```ad-defn
title: Commercial case
Generally, one where all parties are in business and the claim is based on the transaction of trade and commerce. 
```

In non-commercial cases, the courts award interest at their discretion under s 35A of the SCA 1981 or s 69 of the CCA 1984 at 8% pa. Traditionally, in commercial cases, the award of interest has been at 1% or 2% over base rate. However, in J[[aura v Ahmed [2002] EWCA Civ 210]], the Court of Appeal held that it is permissible for a judge to depart from this conventional rate if it is necessary to reflect the higher rate at which the claimant had to borrow, e.g., if the claimant was a small businessperson who could only borrow from a bank at 3% pa over base rate.

Generally, a person of the claimant's general position will be considered, but no regard will be given to the claimant's particular attributes.

Generally, simple interest rather than compound interest is awarded (unless there is a contractual term providing for this), or in exceptional cases (see [[Sempra Metals Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners [2007] UKHL 34]]).

 ![[Interest-flowchart.png]]

Key questions:

- Is the claim based on a written contract providing for interest?
- Is the claim for the payment of a commercial debt?

Remember D might be in a position to make a claim that includes interest.

## Foreign Element

In international cases, consider:

- Which countries can the claim be brought in?
- English courts can hear any proceedings if the claim form was served on D whilst they were present in England and Wales.
- D could object to the proceedings continuing in England, on the basis that a court abroad would be the most appropriate forum.

## Litigation Alternatives

### Arbitration

```ad-defn
title: Arbitration
Adjudication operating outside the normal court process, by which a third party reaches a decision binding on the parties in dispute. 
```

Many business contracts specify using arbitration rather than litigation.

Advantages:

- Speed
- Less formal
- Private
- Often more practical than the solutions a court has power to order
- Decisions binding on parties.

```ad-important
The winning party to an arbitration can apply to the High Court for permission to enforce the arbitration award as if it were a court judgment (Arbitration Act 1996, s 66).
```

Disadvantages:

- Certain remedies like injunctions not available
- Can be less in depth than a court investigation
- Not always cheaper.

### Alternative Dispute Resolution

Independent third parties helps parties reach a solution. The third party will often suggest a solution to the parties but not impose one (known as ‘non-determinative ADR’). But sometimes the third party will impose a solution (known as ‘determinative ADR’). The decision to use ADR is voluntary; the parties choose the process and either of them can withdraw at any time before a settlement is reached.

```ad-example
title: ADR examples
- mediation
- expert appraisal
- expert determination
```

Under the CPR 1998, the courts actively encourage parties to use some form of ADR.

```ad-question
title: Can a court order that parties must use an ADR method?

No, held the Court of Appeal in [[Halsey v Milton Keynes General NHS Trust [2004] EWCA Civ 576]]. 
```

Distinguish this from Early Neutral Evaluation, which the court can order parties to engage with since it is part of the court process (unlike mediation etc.).

### Trade Schemes

Some professional bodies and trade associations have their own dispute resolution schemes

### Negotiating Settlements

Negotiations should be commenced as soon as possible. Once reasonable attempts at settling have been exhausted, there may be no option but to go to court.

### Insurance

Many D's are insured. The existence of insurers does not affect the conduct of proceedings, though the majority of policies require the insured to notify the insurer of any potential claim.

$\exists$ circumstances where a judgement against an insured defendant can be enforced against the insurers. Notice of the proceedings must be served on the insurers either before or within seven days of commencing proceedings to invoke these provisions.

### Motor Insurance Bureau (MIB)

Two schemes allowing the victims of uninsured/ untraced drivers to recover losses. It is set up by insurance companies and financed by them.

### Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)

Body set up by the Government to provide the victims of criminal acts with ex gratia compensation for any personal injuries sustained as a result of those acts.

### Criminal Compensation Order

Criminal courts have powers to order compensation in respect of any personal injury, loss or damage resulting from a criminal offence when imposing a sentence at the end of criminal proceedings.
