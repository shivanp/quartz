# Early Action

- After the initial interview, a number of practical preliminary steps should be taken by the solicitor.
- Bear in mind CPR 1998 pre-action protocols if appropriate.
- If not, comply with the 'spirit' of the protocols and the Practice Direction on the Pre-action Conduct and Protocols.

## Writing to the Client

Advise client in writing. By now you should have identified the cause of action, undertaken any necessary legal research and assessed the available evidence. If a proof of evidence has been taken from the client, this should be sent to the client for approval and signature. If there are any ‘gaps’ in the case – factual issues in respect of which there is no evidence or weak evidence – you must explain this to the client and outline the options.

Either include etails of funding and costs, or put these in a separate letter. Cost advice should include:

- (a) advising the client of the basis and terms of the firm’s charges;
- (b) advising the client of likely payments to third parties (eg court fees, barristers’ fees, experts’ fees);
- (c) setting out how the client has agreed to pay; and
- (d) advising the client of their potential liability for another party’s costs.

## Interviewing Witnesses

### Proof of Evidence

Take a proof of evidence from a witness asap. The solicitor may request an interview with anyone who may have information about the case. However, there is nothing that can be done if a witness absolutely refuses to give a statement.

### Professional Conduct

It is permissible for a solicitor to interview and take a proof of evidence (statement) from a prospective witness where that witness has already been interviewed by another party.

However, there is a risk that the solicitor will be exposed to the allegation that they have improperly tampered with evidence. This can be overcome by offering to conduct the interview in the presence of a representative of the other party.

A client can through their solicitor pay reasonable expenses to a witness and reasonable compensation for their time attending court.

### Reluctant Witness

Important to persuade potential witnesses to give a statement if at all possible – otherwise at trial there is no guarantee they will say anything useful.

### Taking Proof of Evidence

Interview may be at the solicitor's office or wherever the witness prefers (e.g., their home).

- Take personal details
- Note relationship to client
- Ask open and closed questions
- Want to record the witness's own words
- Obtain relevant documents – probe about this
- Picture painting – need the witness to tell a story which is clear.
- Set witness statement out in numbered paragraphs.
- Judge credibility of witness: are there any inconsistencies? Spot and clarify these now rather than have them come up in trial.
- Pursue other lines of inquiry opened up by interview.
- Be wary of witness being 'too helpful' - better to spot weaknesses now
- Summarise what you have grasped
- Type up proof of evidence and send it to the witness for correction/ approval.

## Preserving Documents

Ask client to bring all relevant documents with them as soon as possible.

- A solicitor is under an obligation, both as a matter of professional conduct and under the CPR 1998, to ensure that the client understands the rules relating to disclosure of documents.
- Explain that documents includes digital recordings, laptops, etc.
- Explain that the duty extends to documents that the client might previously have had in their physical possession, even if they have now been, say, lost, destroyed or given to someone else.

Read documents to ensure there are no nasty surprises (e.g., limitation clauses in contracts).

## Obtaining Expert Evidence

### Instructing Expert

- Firm probably has contacts
- If counsel are involved from an early stage, they may be able to recommend suitable experts.
- Look through The Law Society, or Academy of Expert Witnesses.

Expert must:

- Have expertise
- Be able to present a convincing and easily understood report
- To perform well as a witness, particularly under cross-examination.

### Paying Expert

Clear expert's fees with the clients.

```ad-question
title: Can an expert be instructed on a conditional or contingency fee basis?
No - para 88 Guidance for the Instruction of Experts in Civil Claims. Incompatible with an expert's duty of independence and impartiality. 
```

The use of expert evidence during proceedings requires permission from the court. So the fee paid to the expert may not be recoverable from the opponent even if the client is successful in litigation.

### Expert Reports

Check the report for errors. Send to the client to do the same. Be open to returning to the expert for clarification.

### Opinion

An expert can give opinion evidence (while an ordinary witness cannot).

```ad-statute
title: Section 3(1) Civil Evidence Act 1972
Where a person is called as a witness in any civil proceedings, his opinion on any relevant matter on which he is qualified to give expert evidence shall be admissible in evidence.
```

### Restriction on Use of Expert Evidence

CPR 1998 introduced significant restrictions on the use of expert evidence.

Although a party to proceedings is free to obtain as much expert evidence as they wish, the extent to which such evidence may be used in court is strictly controlled. By r 35.1 of the CPR 1998, expert evidence is restricted to that which is reasonably required to resolve the proceedings. The court can therefore limit the number of expert witnesses who can give evidence, or order that a single joint expert be appointed, or restrict expert evidence to a written report rather than oral evidence in court.

A solicitor advising a client on whether to obtain expert evidence should always bear in mind that the costs of doing so will usually be recoverable from the opponent (assuming the case is won) only if the court gives permission for the expert evidence to be used.

## Site Visits

May be needed for the purpose of taking photographs or making plans. Though unlikely to be disputed, the person who took the photo/ made the plan may have to give evidence, so should be someone who is not the solicitor. For a formal plan, hire a surveyor. If an inspection will be expensive, obtain prior authorisation from the client.

## Instructing Counsel

### Use of Counsel

It is not necessary to instruct a barrister in every case.

```ad-bug
title:
As a highly trained lawyer, the solicitor should have confidence in their own knowledge and ability!!
```

Judicious use of counsel is sensible. If issues are difficult, sensible to instruct counsel to advise on liability. Counsel's opinion on quantum may b needed at an early stage if the case is not straightforward.

### Method

Instructing counsel requires the preparation of a formal document (called ‘Instructions to counsel’). It will bear the heading of the claim (or proposed claim) and should contain a list of the enclosures being forwarded to counsel. The enclosures will obviously vary with the case but will typically include copies of the client’s statement, any other proofs of evidence, any existing statements of case, any experts’ reports, and any relevant correspondence.

The body of the instructions to counsel will identify the client and set out briefly both sides of the case. Counsel can refer to the enclosures for detail, but the instructions should contain sufficient information to enable the barrister to identify the major issues. The solicitor should indicate their own view of the case and draw counsel’s attention to those areas on which particular advice is required. The instructions will end with a formal request to counsel to carry out the required task.

The instructions must carry a back sheet endorsed with the title of the claim, what the instructions are (eg, ‘Instructions to counsel to advise on quantum’), counsel’s name and chambers, and the solicitor’s firm’s name, address and reference.

Sometimes, counsel may not be able to proceed without a conference (the name given to a meeting with counsel) with the solicitor and the client. If a written opinion is required, this should be made clear in the instructions, but the costs of both will not be recoverable from the other side unless the court thinks it was reasonable to seek a written opinion.

Instructions are traditionally prepared using the third person. Some law firms scrap this.

### Professional Conduct

A solicitor can rely on counsel's advice, but should still exercise some judgment – if the advice is glaringly wrong, under a duty to reject it. Where a solicitor relies on the advice of counsel and subsequently both are sued by the client in negligence, the solicitor is likely to seek an indemnity or a contribution from counsel (see,

for example, [[Percy v Merriman White [2021] EWHC 22 (Ch)]]).

## Pre-action Protocols

```ad-example
title: Protocols
There are approved protocols for debt claims, personal injury, clinical disputes, construction and engineering, judicial review, media and communications, disease and illness, package travel claims, possession claims by social landlords, possession claims for mortgage arrears, housing condition cases (England); Housing Disrepair Cases (Wales), low value personal injury claims in road traffic accidents, personal injury claims below the small claims limit in road traffic accidents, dilapidations (commercial property), low value employers’ and public liability claims, and professional negligence claims.
```

### Aims

The main aim is efficiency! More specifically,

- (a) to initiate and increase pre-action contact between the parties;
- (b) to encourage better and earlier exchange of information;
- (c) to encourage better pre-action investigation by both sides;
- (d) to put the parties in a position where they may be able to settle cases fairly and early without litigation;
- (e) to enable proceedings to run to the court’s timetable and efficiently, if litigation does become necessary.

### Steps

The Practice Direction and protocols deal with matters such as notification to the defendant of a possible claim as soon as possible, the form of the letter before claim, disclosure of documents and the instruction of experts, where relevant.

```ad-statute
title: Para 3 Practice Direction
Before commencing proceedings, the court will expect parties to have exchanged sufficient information to:
- (a) understand each other’s position;
- (b) make decisions about how to proceed;
- (c) try to settle the issues without proceedings;
- (d) consider a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to assist with settlement;
- (e) support the efficient management of those proceedings; and
- (f) reduce the costs of resolving the dispute.
```

Para 8 of the Practice Direction states that the parties should consider whether some form of ADR procedure would enable them to settle their dispute without commencing proceedings. The courts take the view that litigation should be a last resort, and that claims should not be issued prematurely when a settlement is still actively being explored. Parties are warned that if this provision is not followed, then the court must have regard to such conduct when determining costs.

### Sanctions for Non-compliance

Where non-compliance has led to proceedings that might otherwise not have been commenced, or has led to unnecessary costs being incurred, the court may impose sanctions.

Includes:

- Party at fault pay some or all of opponent's costs,
- Depriving a claimant who is at fault of some or all of the interest they may be awarded on damages they recover,
- Requiring D who is at fault to pay interest on some or all of any damages that are subsequently awarded to the claimant.

The court should aim to place the innocent party in no worse a position than they would have been in had the Practice Direction or approved protocol been complied with (see [[Straker v Tudor Rose (a firm) [2007] EWCA Civ 368]]). And if proceedings occur, the party awarded costs should usually be able to recover reasonable pre-action costs.

## Pre-action Correspondence

### Letter Before Claim

Where the solicitor is satisfied that the client has a valid claim, they should advise the client and obtain instructions to send a letter to the prospective defendant setting out full details of the claim. This is called a ‘letter before claim’.

```ad-note
Called a "letter of claim" in professional negligence pre-action protocols and a "letter before claim" in PD of pre-action conduct. 
```

### Professional Conduct

The letter is normally addressed to the potential defendant in person, or to their solicitor if they already have one. If the potential defendant is likely to be insured, the solicitor should ask that the letter is passed on to the insurers.

### Practice Direction Guidance

The Practice Direction provides at para 6(a) that the claimant’s letter before claim should give  
concise details about the matter.

```ad-example
title: Suggested to include
1. state the claimant’s full name and address;
2. state the basis on which the claim is made (ie why the claimant says the defendant is liable);
3. provide a clear summary of the facts on which the claim is based;
4. state what the claimant wants from the defendant;
5. if financial loss is claimed, provide an explanation of how the amount has been calculated;
6. list the essential documents on which the claimant intends to rely;
7. set out the form of ADR (if any) that the claimant considers the most suitable and invite the defendant to agree to this;
8. state the date by which the claimant considers it reasonable for a full response to be provided by the defendant; and
9. identify and ask for copies of any relevant documents not in the claimant’s possession and which the claimant wishes to see.
```

Straightforward claim: give 14 days for acknowledgement of receipt and/ or full response. For more tricky stuff involving insurers, give a month or even three.

Also include some helpful suggestions:

1. refer the defendant to the Practice Direction and in particular draw attention to paragraph 16 concerning the court’s powers to impose sanctions for failure to comply with the Practice Direction;
2. inform the defendant that ignoring the letter before claim may lead to the claimant starting proceedings and may increase the defendant’s liability for costs;
3. warn the defendant of any claim for interest in proceedings that may be commenced; and
4. suggest that the defendant takes independent legal advice.

![[pre-action-flowchart.png]]

![[prof-neg-flowchart.png]]

### Letter of Acknowledgement

Acknowledgement should state whether an insurer is or may be involved and the date by which D/ insurer will provide a full written response.

### Letter of Response Under Practice Direction

Paragraph 6(b) of the Practice Direction provides that the defendant’s letter of response to the  
letter of claim should include:

1. confirmation as to whether the claim is accepted and, if it is not accepted, the reason why;
2. an explanation as to which facts and parts of the claim are disputed; and
3. whether the defendant is making a counterclaim and, if so, its details.

When negotiating with the other side, try to resolve the matter without needing to start proceedings. At the very least, it should be possible, as para 12 of the Practice Direction points out, to establish what issues remain outstanding so as to narrow the scope of any subsequent court proceedings, and therefore limit potential costs.

### Experts

Paragraph 7 of the Practice Direction reminds the parties that many matters can and should  
be resolved without the need for advice or evidence from an expert.

Where the parties go ahead and instruct their own expert or experts pre-action, it will be for the court to determine later if any party can rely on any particular expert’s evidence and how expert evidence should be given at a trial.

### False Statements

Paragraph 2 of the Practice Direction reminds the parties that any person who knowingly makes a false statement in a pre-action protocol letter or other document prepared in anticipation of legal proceedings may be subject to proceedings for contempt of court.

## Pre-action Disclosure

An application for disclosure of documents prior to the start of proceedings is permitted under s 33 of the SCA 1981, or s 52 of the CCA 1984. The application must be supported by evidence, and the procedure is dealt with in r 31.16(3) of the CPR 1998.

The court may make an order for disclosure only where:

- (a) the respondent is likely to be a party to subsequent proceedings;
- (b) the applicant is also likely to be a party to the proceedings;
- (c) if proceedings had started, the respondent’s duty by way of standard disclosure set out in rule 31.6, would extend to the documents or classes of documents of which the applicant seeks disclosure; and
- (d) disclosure before proceedings have started is desirable in order to–
	- (i) dispose fairly of the anticipated proceedings;
	- (ii) assist the dispute to be resolved without proceedings; or
	- (iii) save costs.

An order under this rule must specify the documents or class of documents which the

respondent must disclose, and require them, when making such disclosure, to specify any of those documents which they no longer have, or which they claim the right or duty to withhold from inspection. The order may also specify the time and place for disclosure and inspection to take place.

Common examples are in personal injury litigation and significant commercial cases. The court will not allow applications for pre-action disclosure where there is no sufficient evidence that a claim exists and the application is purely speculative (see [[Hunt v Caddick (Mill Harbour) Ltd [2019] EWHC 2933]]).

## Settlement

### Negotiations 'without Prejudice'

Any negotiations that take place as a part of a genuine attempt to settle a claim are impliedly

‘without prejudice’. However, it is preferable to mark any correspondence accordingly, or to clarify at the start of a meeting/telephone negotiation that this is the basis on which you are proceeding. If ‘without prejudice’ negotiations take place, neither party may rely upon anything said or written in the course of the negotiations for the purpose of proving liability and/or quantum at trial.

The rule exists to encourage litigants to reach a settlement. It means that all negotiations which are genuinely aimed at a settlement are excluded from being given in evidence.

#### Genuine Attempt

Although as a matter of good practice the words ‘without prejudice’ should appear on this type of correspondence, the presence or absence of the words is not conclusive. What is important is that the letter is a genuine attempt to settle the case. If there is a dispute as to whether or not a communication is protected in this way, the court can examine the document (obviously in advance of the trial by someone other than the trial judge) to see whether or not its purpose was to settle the dispute.

The court must consider the circumstances of the communications from an objective standpoint: [[Sang Kook Suh v Mace (UK) Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 4]].

#### Post-settlement

Once a settlement is concluded, any ‘without prejudice’ correspondence can be produced in court to show the terms agreed between the parties. This might be necessary if, for example, a dispute arose as to enforcement of an agreed settlement or the true terms of the agreement reached (see [[Oceanbulk Shipping & Trading SA v TMT Asia Ltd [2010] UKSC 44]]).

```ad-note
If a party wishes to reserve the right to draw the trial judge’s attention to a without prejudice offer to settle a case on the question of costs, they should mark the offer ‘without prejudice save as to costs’
```

A without prejudice or without prejudice save as to costs offer of settlement that has no time limit for acceptance can be accepted even after the trial has started; such an offer does not lapse at the commencement of the hearing (see [[MEF (A Protected Party, by his Mother and Litigation Friend, FEM) v St George's Healthcare NHS Trust [2020] EWHC 1300 (QB)]]).

### Pre-action Offers Under Part 36

Parties are encouraged to negotiate and settle the claim. Part 36 formally recognises this and lends weight to such offers.

Any party can offer to settle a monetary claim for a specific sum, or on express terms for any non-monetary claim.

- If litigation occurs and the claimant fails to obtain a judgment more advantageous than a defendant’s Part 36 offer, the claimant will usually suffer severe financial penalties.
- If a claimant makes a Part 36 offer and the judgment against the defendant is at least as advantageous to the claimant as the proposals contained in the claimant’s Part 36 offer, the defendant will usually suffer severe financial penalties.

Take care when drafting Part 36 offers to ensure that the stated terms are consistent with Part 36. Else, there is a risk that the court may not apply Part 36 financial penalties. The court may take the offer into account when exercising its general discretion with regard to costs (see [[James v James [2018] EWHC 242 (Ch)]]).

### Researching the Law

This will often not be necessary, but do double check current authorities.

For procedural points, check CPR 1998, Practice Directions and relevant case law.

### Cost-benefit Analysis

Discuss potential outcomes of any legal case with the client, including the risk of having to pay opponent's costs. Court is hella expensive – usually tens of thousands for cases that make it to the senior courts.
