# Settlement

## Pre-action Settlements

### Costs and Interest

When a settlement is reached prior to the issue of proceedings, the prospective claimant will not be entitled to recover their legal costs unless this has been agreed. Neither will they be entitled to interest on any sum agreed under s 69 of the CCA 1984, or s 35A of the SCA 1981.

There may, however, be an entitlement to interest under contract or the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, and such should be taken into account during any negotiations and as part of any settlement.

### Recording Pre-action Settlement

Record settlement terms in writing for safety. An exchange of correspondence is usually fine, but for complicated stuff sign a formal settlement agreement.

Take care to ensure that all necessary terms are included in any offer to settle ([[Evans v Trebuchet Design Ltd [2020] EWHC 3037 (IPEC)]]). Remember non-disclosure clauses, if applicable.

## Settlements After Proceedings

Preferable for the settlement to be recorded in a court order or judgment, to make enforcement easier. The date by which debt/ damages must be paid should be specified in the judgment/ order. Unless the settlement provides otherwise, interest is not payable on costs until judgment is entered.

### Consent Orders or Judgments

Where none of the parties is a litigant in person, it will often be possible to avoid an application to the court by drawing up a consent order or judgment for sealing by a court officer under r 40.6.

The court has theoretical power not to approve a proposed order, but will only be referred to a judge if it appears incorrect/ unclear.

```ad-test
title: Formalities for a consent order: r 40.6(7)
1. the order agreed by the parties must be drawn up in the terms agreed;
2. it must be expressed as being ‘By Consent’;
3. it must be signed by the legal representative acting for each of the parties to whom the order relates.
```

```ad-important
1. The terms of a consent order will be open to public inspection. 
2. The terms agreed must be within the powers of a court to order. 
```

If the parties want any terms to be confidential and/or beyond the powers of a court to order, they should use a Tomlin order.

### Tomlin Orders

A Tomlin order **stays the claim on agreed terms** that are set out in a schedule to the order, an agreement annexed to the order or a separate document.

```ad-tip
The key to drafting a Tomlin order correctly is to appreciate that certain terms must appear in the order itself, whilst others can be put in the schedule, agreement or separate document.
```

which comes from:

```ad-statute
title: PD 40B, para 3.5
Where the parties draw up a consent order in the form of a stay of proceedings on agreed terms, disposing of the proceedings, and where the terms are recorded in a schedule to the order, any direction for:
1. payment of money out of court, or
2. payment and assessment of costs

should be contained in the body of the order and not in the schedule.
```

Where one party is to pay another party’s costs and/or the parties want the amount of those costs assessed by the court (known as a *detailed assessment*), that direction must go in the order.

When assessing payment of costs, ask

- Why pays?
- For what?
- How much?
- By when?

Moreover, because there is a possibility that a party may not perform its part of the agreement, the order should include a provision that any party is at liberty to apply for the stay to be lifted so that the court can enforce the settlement. This means that it is not necessary to start new proceedings to enforce the terms ([[Trebisol Sud Ouest SAS v Berkley Finance Ltd [2021] EWHC 2494 (QB)]]).

#### Degrees of Confidentiality

Whether the terms of the settlement are recorded in a schedule to the Tomlin order, an agreement annexed to the document or a separate document depends largely on the degree of confidentiality required.

```ad-statute
Under r 5.4B and r 5.4C, parties and non-parties can apply for permission to obtain copies of documents filed with the court.
```

Therefore, the only way to ensure complete confidentiality is to **record the settlement in a separate document which is referred to in the schedule and clearly identifiable but not filed with the court**. In [[Zenith Logistics Services (UK) Ltd & Others v Coury [2020] EWHC 774 (QB)]], the court confirmed that the fact the terms were referred to but not set out in the schedule was entirely unobjectionable. The reason was to preserve confidentiality so that the terms were not accessible to third parties. And there was no breach of the ‘open justice’ principle.

#### Summary

Points to consider when drafting order/ schedule:

| Order | Schedule/Annexed Agreement/Separate Document |
|:--------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 'By Consent' | Include any agreed term that court could not order |
| Stay of proceedings | Any payment of money should include provision for interest on late payment |
| Liberty to apply |                                                                            |
| Payment of money out of court |                                                                            |
| Payment of costs |                                                                            |
| Detailed assessment of costs |                                                                            |
| Signed by the parties' solicitors | |

## Part 36

![[part36-diagram.png]]

Before litigation starts, parties can make 'without prejudice' offers to settle. If proceedings issued, continually review the case.

- r 36.7(1): a Part 36 offer may be made both before and during proceedings.
- r 44.2: the court will take into account when deciding the issue of costs any admissible offer to settle that has been made.
- r 36.16(1): a Part 36 offer will be treated as ‘without prejudice except as to costs’.

Part 36 offer has been made must not normally be communicated to the trial judge (or to any judge allocated in advance to conduct the trial) until the case has been decided.

```ad-warning
If a defendant makes a Part 36 offer and the claimant fails to obtain a judgment more advantageous than that offer, the claimant will usually suffer severe financial penalties
```

### Form and Content

r 36.5(1):

1. be in writing;
2. make clear that it is made pursuant to Part 36;
3. specify a period of not less than 21 days during which, if the offeree accepts the offer, the defendant will pay the claimant’s costs under r 36.13 (known as ‘the relevant period’);
4. state whether it relates to the whole of the claim or to part of it; and
5. state whether it takes into account any counterclaim.

But it is not part of this mandatory requirement, once the period has been specified, to state expressly that this is the period ‘within which the defendant will be liable for the claimant’s costs in accordance with rule 36.13 if the offer is accepted’. If an offeree receives a Part 36 offer and they wish to challenge the validity of the offer, they should do so without delay.

Part 36 offers are made by a claimant and/or a defendant in a monetary claim to settle the claim on payment of a lump sum. r 36.6, a Part 36 offer by a defendant to pay a sum of money in settlement of a claim must be an offer to pay a single sum of money. Under r 36.5(5), ‘a Part 36 offer to accept a sum of money may make provision for accrual of interest on such sum after the date specified in paragraph (4).

#### >1 Offer

Can make multiple offers. If none is accepted, the financial consequences of r 36.17 will be imposed on the defendant should the claimant secure a judgment that is at least as advantageous to them as the proposals contained in one of their Part 36 offers.

A Part 36 offer is not like an offer in the ordinary law of contract where an offer which is rejected, either expressly or by the making of a counter-offer, cannot subsequently be accepted. That is not true of a Part 36 offer, which may be accepted even after the offeree has put forward a different proposal.

### Offers Made Close to Trial

As the relevant period is a minimum of 21 days, can an offer be made less than 21 days before the start of a trial?

- r 36.3(g)(ii): the relevant period is the period up to the end of the trial.
- r 36.5(4)(b): such an offer is deemed inclusive of interest up to a date 21 days after the offer was made.
- If the trial starts then, by r 36.11(3)(d), the offeree will need the court’s permission to accept the Part 36 offer.

### Offer Made When Served

r 36.7(2): Part 36 offer is made when served on the offeree. If the offeree is legally represented, the offer must be served on solicitors. The usual rules of deemed service apply.

### Withdrawal or Changing Terms

r 36.10(3): possible to withdraw/ change terms only if court agrees. The offeror must serve written notice of the withdrawal or change of terms on the offeree. This can be done by letter.

Suppose a defendant wishes to decrease the amount they previously offered. They should serve a notice of variation of the original offer under r 36.9(4). This preserves the relevant period of the original offer for the purpose of costs where the offeree fails to beat the less advantageous offer.

```ad-important
By r 36.17(7), where a Part 36 offer is withdrawn or its terms made less advantageous to the offeree, and the offeree has beaten the less advantageous offer, the financial consequences of r 36.17 will not apply to it.
```

### Clarification

Where monetary and/or non-monetary remedies are sought, it is possible that an offeree may not be clear about the terms proposed. By r 36.8, an offeree may, within seven days of receiving a Part 36 offer, request clarification from the offeror. Best practice to make request in writing. 21 days minimum is given to an offeree to accept a Part 36 offer. After this, offeree may accept offer but suffer a costs penalty.

### Acceptance

- A Part 36 offer may be accepted at any time, whether or not the offeree has subsequently made a different offer, unless the offeror has served notice of withdrawal of that offer on the offeree.
- r 36.11(1): an offeree can accept a Part 36 offer by serving written notice of the acceptance on the offeror.
- No prescribed form.
- If proceedings have started, must also file with the court (PD 36 para 3.1).
- r 21.10: acceptance on behalf of a child/ protected party is not valid unless the court has approved the settlement.

#### Consequence

Where a Part 36 offer is accepted, **the claim is stayed**. This does not affect the power of the court to enforce the terms of a Part 36 offer and deal with any question of costs.

```ad-question
title: Is an agreement reached by the acceptance of a Part 36 offer void if that Part 36 offer was a clear and obvious mistake that was appreciated by the Part 36 offeree at the point of acceptance? 
Yes, and to that extent the doctrine of common law mistake can apply to a Part 36 offer ([[O’Grady v B15 Group Ltd [2022] EWHC 67 (QB)]]).
```

Where a claimant accepts a defendant’s Part 36 offer that is, or includes, an offer to pay a  
single sum of money, that sum must be paid to the claimant within **14 days** of the date of  
acceptance. If the accepted sum is not paid within 14 days, the claimant may enter judgment for the unpaid sum.

#### Costs Consequences

Where a defendant’s Part 36 offer is accepted by the claimant within the relevant period, the claimant is entitled to their costs of the proceedings up to the date on which notice of acceptance is served on the defendant.

![[part36-acceptance-consequences.png]]

Where a claimant’s Part 36 offer is accepted by the defendant within the relevant period, the claimant is entitled to their costs of the proceedings up to the date on which notice of acceptance is served on the claimant.

![[part36-2.png]]

#### Late Acceptance

If a claimant accepts D's offer 'late' (after the relevant period specified in the offer has expired) and the parties cannot agree on costs, the court will make an order.

r 36.13(5): unless the court considers it unjust to do so:

1. the defendant will be ordered to pay the claimant’s costs of the proceedings up to the date on which the relevant period expired; and
2. the claimant will be ordered to pay the defendant’s costs for the period from the date of expiry of the relevant period to the date of acceptance.

![[part36-3.png]]

For these purposes, the claimant’s costs include any costs incurred in dealing with a defendant’s counterclaim if the Part 36 offer states that it takes that into account.

The presumption is that the price of late acceptance for a claimant is to pay the defendant’s costs on the standard basis from when the relevant period expired until the date of acceptance. The court must guard against making an exception from the norm on the grounds that the regime itself is harsh or unjust, but must find something about the particular circumstances of the case which takes it out of the norm. Remember, the purpose of Part 36 is to promote compromise and avoid unnecessary expenditure of costs and court time.

- The burden is on the claimant to show injustice.
- Only in exceptional circumstances will the court not require the claimant to make the payment of costs under r 26.13(5)(b).
- Particular care should be taken when making a Part 36 offer to a litigant in person, to draw special attention to the provision.
- A claimant can also be ordered to pay D's costs incurred (indemnity basis) between expiry of the relevant period and acceptance.

### Part 36 Consequences at Trial

- If claimant at trial/ summary judgment gets a more advantageous offer, D pays amount of judgment and usually V's costs on a standard basis.
- If V fails to obtain a better judgment than that Part 36, the court will usually make a split costs order r 36.17(3).

### 'Like for Like' Comparison

To make a like-for-like comparison between the Part 36 offer and (judgment + interest + costs):

- Calculate interest that would have accrued on the sum awarded by the judge from the date it becomes payable < period $\leq$ end of relevant period (normally day 21)
- Add this to amount of judgment.

### Split Costs Order

Court must, unless unjust, order that D entitled to costs from expiry of relevant period + interests on costs (r 36.17(3)).

The usual costs order is that the losing party should pay the winning party's costs, and interest on costs is normally payable from the day of judgment.

Effects of r 36.17(3) is:

1. D pays V's costs from when those costs were first incurred until the relevant period expired (21 days, usually)
2. V pays D's costs from expiry of relevant period (day 22) until judgment. Costs should be agreed by the parties, or otherwise will be assessed on the standard basis. Also pays **interest** on these costs from when each item was incurred.

```ad-question
title: Why is the standard basis rather than the indemnity basis used as the starting point for r 36.16(3)(a)?
Indemnity costs only appropriate when conduct of a paying party is unreasonable to a high degree. So there must be something taking the case outside the norm. Ask: was there a point when the reasonable claimant would have concluded that the offer represented a better outcome than the likely outcome at trial. 
```

So the pursuit of a weak claim will not normally, on its own, justify an order for indemnity costs. But pursuit of a hopeless claim may lead to an order. Interest is not payable on costs until after judgment. This is usually at the normal commercial rate.

![[part36-4.png]]

#### Claimant Who Loses at Trial

What if the claimant fails to establish liability and so is awarded no sum of money? The normal court order would be for the claimant to pay D's costs from when these were first incurred by D to judgment. But because of the Part 36 order, D should argue that the claimant should pay interest on D's costs, from when the relevant period for acceptance of the offer expired.

![[part36-5.png]]

### Tactical Considerations

A Part 36 offer can provide a useful mechanism for pressurising the claimant to accept a reasonable settlement. The earlier a Part 36 offer is made, the greater the potential costs protection for D.

### Part 36 Consequences at Trial of Claimant Offer

If judgment against D is at least as advantageous as V's Part 36, court must order that V is entitled to:

1. Interest for some/ all of the period starting **on** the date the relevant period expired ($\leq 10\% +$ base rate)
	- Common-sense reading = day 22
	- There is a cap on the amount of interest that can be awarded on damages by the trial judge and under r 36.17(4), which is 10% over base rate.
	- Enhanced interest: Award of interest on damages under r 36.17(4)
	- The level of interest awarded must be proportionate to the circumstances of the case.
2. Costs on the indemnity basis, **from** date on which the relevant period expired
	- Starts running day 22
	- Principles from [[OMV Petrom SA v Glencore International AG [2017] EWCA Civ 195]]
		- 10% is the starting point.
		- Aim is to provide penalties and rewards to encourage reasonable settlements being made.
		- Flexible to account for different factors.
3. Interest on costs ($\leq 10\% +$ base rate)
4. Additional amount $\leq £75,000$ calculated as a prescribed percentage.
	- Note interest should be included only where it arises under contract/ court's discretionary power.
	- Interest not payable on additional sum.

| Amount awarded by the court    | Prescribed percentage                                            |
|:------------------------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\leq £500,000$                | 10% of the amount awarded;                                       |
| $£500,000 < X \leq £1,000,000$ | 10% of the first £500,000 and 5% of any amount above that figure |
| $X > £100,000$                  | $£75,000$                                                                 |

#### Tactical Considerations

D refuses V's Part 36 and V obtains a judgment the same or better than Part 36 ⇾ D is likely to pay a heavy price. Whereas the other way around, V unlikely to pay a heavy price. So Part 36 has the effect of pressurising defendants.

```ad-action
Since the penalties in r 36.17(4) are imposed as from the expiry of the relevant period, the earlier the claimant makes their offer, the greater the pressure on the defendant.
```

Note that the court retains ultimate discretion; it can choose to award some of the s 36.17(4) penalties, but not others.

### “Advantageous”

Means better in monetary terms, by no matter how small an amount.

### Unjust Orders

Recall, a well-judged offer that is not accepted will lead to an order under r 36.17(3) or (4), unless it would be unjust for the court to make that order.

```ad-statute
title: r 36.17(5)
In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including—
- (a) the terms of any Part 36 offer;
- (b) the stage in the proceedings when any Part 36 offer was made, including in particular how long before the trial started the offer was made;
- (c) the information available to the parties at the time when the Part 36 offer was made;
- (d) the conduct of the parties with regard to the giving of or refusal to give information for the purposes of enabling the offer to be made or evaluated; and
- (e) whether the offer was a genuine attempt to settle the proceedings.
```

Note these are just examples which do not constrain the creativity of the court.

```ad-warning
In determining whether or not it is unjust to make orders rr 36.17(3) & (4), the court cannot consider by how much the judgment against D was more advantageous than the Part 36 offer ([[JLE v Warrington & Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust [2019] EWHC 1582 (QB)]])
```

The test of unjustness should be separately applied to each of the four consequences.

Tactics: make a Part 36 offer for marginally less than the full sum claimed (0.3% in [[Rawbank SA v Travelex Banknotes Ltd [2020] EWHC 1619 (Ch)]]). Then if D rejects and you win the full amount, get bare costs.

### R 36.17(3) & CFA

| Scenario                                                                | Consequence                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| V rejects the offer on the basis of advice from the solicitors/ counsel | Success fee not payable on charges incurred after day 22 |
| V rejects offer against advice of solicitor/ counsel                    | Success fee payable.                                                         |

### Secrecy

Part 36 offer should not be revealed to the trial judge until all questions of liability and quantum have been decided (except in super rare cases). Part 36 offers are "without prejudice save as to costs" - this does not need to be said explicitly.

### Part 36 & Counterclaim

Rules still apply for counterclaim.

### Indemnity Vs Standard Basis

If costs are calculated on the standard basis, any ambiguity is resolved in favour of the paying party. But on the indemnity basis, ambiguities resolved in favour of the receiving party.

### Telephone hearings/ Video Conferencing

Many district registries **now have facilities to deal with interim applications by telephone conferencing**.

```ad-guid
title: General rule
At a telephone enabled court all allocation hearings, listing hearings, interim applications, case management conferences and pre-trial reviews with a time estimate of less than an hour will be conducted by telephone
```

Exceptions:

- applications made with no notice to other party
- where all parties are unrepresented
- where more than 4 parties wish to make representations at hearing
- if application is being heard by telephone then no party/party’s legal representative can attend the judge in person
	- unless every other party has agreed

PD 23A, paras 6.9 and 6.10: mechanics of telephone conference hearing

```ad-action
Applicant’s legal representative must file and serve case summary and draft order no later than 4pm 2 days before the telephone hearing if the claim has been allocated to multi-track or if the court directs.
```

### Preparing Supporting Evidence

General questions about witness statement:

1. Why should make statement?
2. What should be included?
3. How should the statement appear?
4. What about hearsay?

Don't include points of law.

### Public/ Private Hearings

See r 39.2 CPR for guidance.

- Generally, hearings are public, except if the court decides it should be private.
- Court will bear in mind freedom of expression considerations.
- When deciding on private, court considers factors including:
	- If publicity would defeat the object
	- National security
	- Confidential information (e.g., personal financial information)
	- Child/ protected party

## Interim Costs

### Costs of Applying

Any interim court application costs money. The judge may decide that one party should pay the other's costs–'pay as you go litigation'.

The normal order is that an applicant pays the respondent's costs of application, including additional costs. Expressed as 'costs of and caused by'.

### Possible Orders

For named party A, unnamed party B:

| Term                                        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| No order as to costs                        | Each party bears their own costs, whichever way the judgment goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If there is no mention of costs, the general rule is that none are payable in respect of that application.

### Summary Assessment

If costs are ordered in favour of one of the parties, the court will make a summary assessment of costs on the spot, payable within 14 days unless otherwise specified.

Parties are required, $\geq 24$ hours prior to hearing, to file and serve a statement of costs, providing a breakdown of costs.

Model form of the statement of costs (Form N260).

## Fixed Costs

The court may award fixed costs rather than making an order. Part 45 sets out the occasions on which fixed costs may be granted and specifies the amount awarded to the receiving party.

### Cost-capping Order (r 3.19)

If one or more parties does not follow relevant pre-action protocol, unnecessary costs may be incurred. Court may make an order capping the amount of costs recoverable by a party incurred after that date.

| Costs capping | Costs management order |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Caps costs, made in exceptional circumstances.     | Does not limit the costs recoverable unless varied.                        |

Most reported applications of costs capping have failed. There is specific provision for costs  
capping orders in judicial review proceedings. Governed by s 88 Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015. Provisions apply where the application for leave to bring judicial review proceedings has been granted. Test set out in s 88(6).

```ad-statute
title: s 88(6) Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015
The court may make a costs capping order only if it is satisfied that—
- (a) the proceedings are public interest proceedings,
- (b) in the absence of the order, the applicant for judicial review would withdraw the application for judicial review or cease to participate in the proceedings, and
- (c) it would be reasonable for the applicant for judicial review to do so.
```

### Making an Application

Normally it is D seeking to cap what V recovers in costs. Make claim as soon as possible.

- Evidence should set out whether the costs-capping order applies to whole litigation/ some part.
- Accompany with budget, setting out costs and disbursements.
- Court will direct that other parties file a similar budget.

### Grounds for Making Order

```ad-statute
title: r 3.19(5)
The court may at any stage of proceedings make a costs capping order against all or any of the parties, if –

(a) it is in the interests of justice to do so;

(b) there is a substantial risk that without such an order costs will be disproportionately incurred; and

(c) it is not satisfied that the risk in subparagraph (b) can be adequately controlled by –
- (i) case management directions or orders made under this Part; and
- (ii) detailed assessment of costs.
```

```ad-statute
title: r 3.19(6)
In considering whether to exercise its discretion under this rule, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including –
- (a) whether there is a substantial imbalance between the financial position of the parties;
- (b) whether the costs of determining the amount of the cap are likely to be proportionate to the overall costs of the litigation;
- (c) the stage which the proceedings have reached; and
- (d) the costs which have been incurred to date and the future costs.
```

### Effect of Order

A costs-capping order, once made, limits the costs recoverable by the party subject to the order unless that party successfully applies to vary it. Variation will only be made if there is a material and substantial change in circumstances/ some other compelling reason.

### Conditional Fee Agreements

Does not prevent costs of interim application from being summarily assessed if the court has awarded costs in favour of a party.

#### Receiving Party CFA-funded

The court **cannot** order payment unless satisfied that the receiving party is immediately liable to their solicitor for the costs of the application under the CFA terms. Summary assessment can only deal with base costs.

#### Paying Party CFA-funded

Party may not be in a position to pay interim costs if ordered to do so Court may decide to defer payment of the interim costs until the end of proceedings.

## Appeals Against Interim Orders

Set out in Part 52 CPR.

### Courts

County Court:

MERMAID1

High Court:

MERMAID2

### Factors

Permission will be granted if:

- Appeal has a real prospect of success, or
- Some other compelling reason for the appeal to be heard (r 52.3(6)).

Seek permission at original hearing/ from Appeal Court within 21 days of decision (either at the first instance, or if permission at the original hearing is refused).

### Appealing

Appeal hearing limited to a review of original decision. No new evidence admitted unless court orders otherwise (r 52.11). The appeal will be allowed if the original decision was wrong/ unjust.

## Set Aside Default Judgment (part 13)

### Mandatory Grounds

Under r 13.2, the court is obliged to set aside a default judgment that was wrongly entered  
before the defendant’s deadline for filing an acknowledgement of service or a defence (whichever is applicable) expired. The court is also obliged to set aside a default judgment  
entered after the claim was paid in full.

### Discretionary Grounds

```ad-statute
title: r 13.3(1)
(1) In any other case, the court may set aside or vary a judgment entered under Part 12 if—
- (a) the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim; or
- (b) it appears to the court that there is some other good reason why—
	- (i) the judgment should be set aside or varied; or
	- (ii) the defendant should be allowed to defend the claim.

(2) In considering whether to set aside or vary a judgment entered under Part 12, the matters to which the court must have regard include whether the person seeking to set aside the judgment made an application to do so promptly.
```

- The court will take account of the promptness of the defendant’s application to set aside
- The overriding objective expressly recognises the importance of ensuring that cases are dealt with expeditiously and fairly.

The application to the court must be on notice and must be supported by evidence. Although  
the rule states that only one of the grounds needs to be satisfied, in practice the defendant will  
usually have to show a defence with a real prospect of success at trial in order to persuade the  
court to exercise its discretion.

If the court accepts that there is a good reason for setting aside, as neither party can be said to be at fault in those circumstances, it is likely that the court will set aside the default judgment and make an order for costs in the case.

### Possible Orders

The court may:

- Set aside default judgment
- Refuse application, or
- Make a conditional order.
	- The normal condition is that the defendant pays into court the amount of the claim or such amount as they can reasonably afford.

### Costs

| Grounds                                   | Who pays costs                                                                                 |
 | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Mandatory grounds                         | Claimant at fault for entering judgment at the wrong time, so usually ordered to pay D's costs |

 | Conditional order due to late application | D pays for being at fault.                                                                                                |

## Summary Judgment (Part 24)

Aim: to enable C/D to obtain judgment at an early stage without the time and expense of a full trial.

```ad-warning
Summary judgment is not the same as default judgment.
```

### Grounds

```ad-statute
title: CPR 24.2
The court may give summary judgment against a claimant or defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if –
- (a) it considers that –
	- (i) that claimant has **no real prospect of succeeding** on the claim or issue; or
	- (ii) that defendant has **no real prospect of successfully defending** the claim or issue; and
- (b) there is **no other compelling reason** why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial.
```

(Rule 3.4 makes provision for the court to strike out a statement of case or part of a statement of case if it appears that it discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending a claim).

Either party can apply for summary judgment, or the court can schedule a hearing on its own initiative.

#### No Real Prospect of Success

The court must scrutinise how the parties have stated their respective cases and examine the essence of the way in which the case or issue is put at the hearing, but no more than that ([[Barks v Instant Access Properties Ltd (In Liquidation) [2013] EWHC 114]]).

To defeat an application for summary judgment, the respondent must have a case which has a “real, as opposed to a fanciful, chance of winning” ([[Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91]]).

```ad-statute
title: PD 24 para 1.3
An application for summary judgment under rule 24.2 may be based on:
1. a point of law (including a question of construction of a document),
2. the evidence which can reasonably be expected to be available at trial or the lack of it, or
3. a combination of these.
```

#### No Other Compelling Reason

Compelling reasons include:

- Need to investigate ([[Celador Productions Limited v Melville [2004] EWHC 2362 (Ch)]])
- Where one party holds all of the factual cards ([[Harrison v Bottenheim (1878) 26 WR 362]])
- Questionable conduct by the applicant ([[Miles v Bull [1969] 1 QB 258]])
- The case is particularly complex ([[Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No 3) [2001] UKHL 16]])
- The case is on a novel point of law for which there is little authority ([[Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91]])

### Procedure

- C **may not** apply for summary judgment **until D has filed an acknowledgement of service or a defence**, unless the court gives permission.
	- If D fails to file acknowledgement of service/ defence, C can enter default judgment without having to make an application for summary judgment.
	- If C files for summary judgment before D files a defence, D need not file a defence until the application has been heard.
- D **may** apply for summary judgment **at any time**.
- Application should be made without delay, usually before filing of direction questionnaires.
- Application notice and evidence should be served on the opponent $\geq 14$ days' before the hearing, unless varied by a practice direction or the court (CPR 24.4(3)).
	- The application notice should
		- State that it is an application for summary judgment
		- Identify concisely any point of law/ provision on which the applicant relies (PD 24 para 2(3))
		- State that it is made because the applicant believes on the evidence that the respondent has no real prospect of succeeding/ successfully defending (PD 24 para 2(3))
		- Inform the other party of their right to file and serve written evidence in reply.
- Respondent should file and serve evidence $\geq 7$ days before the hearing (CPR 24.5(1))
- If the applicant wishes to respond to the respondent's evidence, he should do so $\geq 3$ days before the hearing (CPR 24.5(2)).

### Orders a Court May Make

```ad-statute
title: PD 24 para 5.1
The orders the court may make on an application under Part 24 include:
1. judgment on the claim,
2. the striking out or dismissal of the claim,
3. the dismissal of the application,
4. a conditional order.
```

```ad-important
The claims only go one way. So if C is the applicant, the only possible orders which the court can make are:
1. Granting summary judgment
2. Dismissing the application and allowing the case to proceed to trial.

If D, in addition to opposing the application for summary judgment, wants to apply for an order striking out the (OG) claim, D must make their own application for summary judgment. 
```

If there are credible witnesses both saying opposite things and there is no conclusive circumstantial evidence, the application will be dismissed ([[Hussain v Woods and Another [2001] Lloyd's Rep PN 134]]).

```ad-statute
title: PD 24 para 5.2
A conditional order is an order which requires a party:
1. to pay a sum of money into court, or
2. to take a specified step in relation to his claim or defence, as the case may be, and provides that that party’s claim will be dismissed or his statement of case will be struck out if he does not comply.
```

A conditional order will be granted where it is likely but improbable that a claim/ defence will succeed – where a statement of case is “shadowy and unsatisfactory” ([[Bates v Microstar Ltd]]) or where D has a weak claim and has behaved dishonestly ([[Kooh Veisin Trading Co v Parsai]]).

If the claim might possibly succeed but is unlikely to do so, C will have to pay 75-80% of costs D could reasonably expect to recover if the claim was fully contested ([[Sweetman v Shepherd]]).

### Costs

- Where C is successful in obtaining summary judgment
	- The court will award fixed costs in straightforward cases.
		- £175 if judgment $£25 < P \leq £5,000$
		- £210 if judgment $P > £5,000$
	- Open to C to ask for costs to be summarily assessed.  
		- Court will award C costs of making application (claimant's costs)
		- Fix a date to assess quantum and deal with the costs of the claim (disposal hearing)
- Where D secures summary judgment (claim struck out)
	- D awarded costs of claim (including pre-action), subject to summary assessment.
- Conditional order
	- Costs in the case.

![[summary-judgment-costs.png]]

## Interim Payments Orders

```ad-defn
An interim payment is an advance payment on account of any damages, debt or other sum (excluding costs) which a defendant may be held liable to pay.
```

This gives a claimant with a strong case some money before the case has concluded, to avoid financial hardship. Before applying, the claimant should try to negotiate with D/ D's insurance to obtain a voluntary interim payment.

Cannot be made before the time for acknowledging service has expired.

### Procedure

Application must be supported by evidence and served $\geq 14$ days before hearing date. Evidence required includes (PD 25B para 2.1):

- Amount of interim payment sought
- Items or matters wrt which interim payment sought
- Likely amount of final judgment
- Reasons for application.

**Respondent's** evidence must be served $\geq 7$ days before hearing date. **Applicant's** evidence in response should be served $\geq 3$ days before hearing.

### Grounds

```ad-statute
title: r 25.7(1) CPR 1998
The court may only make an order for an interim payment where any of the following conditions are satisfied –

(a) the defendant against whom the order is sought has admitted liability to pay damages or some other sum of money to the claimant;

(b) the claimant has obtained judgment against that defendant for damages to be assessed or for a sum of money (other than costs) to be assessed;

(c) it is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against the defendant from whom he is seeking an order for an interim payment whether or not that defendant is the only defendant or one of a number of defendants to the claim;

(d) the following conditions are satisfied –
- (i) the claimant is seeking an order for possession of land (whether or not any other order is also sought); and
- (ii) the court is satisfied that, if the case went to trial, the defendant would be held liable (even if the claim for possession fails) to pay the claimant a sum of money for the defendant’s occupation and use of the land while the claim for possession was pending; or

(e) in a claim in which there are two or more defendants and the order is sought against any one or more of those defendants, the following conditions are satisfied –

- (i) the court is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against at least one of the defendants (but the court cannot determine which); and

- (ii) all the defendants are either –

	- (a) a defendant that is insured in respect of the claim;
	
	- (b) a defendant whose liability will be met by an insurer under section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 or an insurer acting under the Motor Insurers Bureau Agreement, or the Motor Insurers Bureau where it is acting itself; or
	
	- (c) a defendant that is a public body.
```

No obligation on applicant to show their need for interim payment, though this would help persuade the court if the delay in assessing damages is unlikely to be substantial.

#### Financial Position

If the respondent wants the court to take into account their financial situation, they should disclose this in their evidence in reply to the application.

#### Standard of Proof

The applicant must prove the grounds of application relied upon up to the civil standard on the balance of probabilities, though in practice this is interpreted as the court being convinced that the applicant **will** succeed, not just it being likely ([[British and Commonwealth Holdings plc v Quadrex Holdings Inc [1989] 3 WLR 723]]).

#### Summary Judgment

Applications for interim payments and summary judgments often combined.

If the applicant can establish an entitlement to an interim payment, the court then has a  
discretion as to:

1. Whether to make an application, and
	- May be inappropriate if issues are complicated.
	- Inappropriate if significant causation issues remain.
2. If so, the amount.
	- The court must not make an interim payment of more than a 'reasonable proportion of the likely amount of the final judgment'
	- Take into account [[Contributory negligence]] and any counter-claim.

### Consequences of Interim Payment Order

If D has made an interim payment that exceeds their total liability under the final judgment, the court will invariably order repayment of the excess ([[Wakefield v NJS [2021] EWHC 3452 (QB)]]) and may award interest on the overpaid amount from the date of the interim payment.

## Security for Costs

```ad-statute
title: r 25.12 - Security for Costs

(1) A defendant to any claim may apply under this Section of this Part for security for his costs of the proceedings.

(Part 3 provides for the court to order payment of sums into court in other circumstances. Rule 20.3 provides for this Section of this Part to apply to Part 20 claims)

(2) An application for security for costs must be supported by written evidence.

(3) Where the court makes an order for security for costs, it will –
- (a) determine the amount of security; and
- (b) direct –
	- (i) the manner in which; and
	- (ii) the time within which

the security must be given.
```

```ad-statute
title: r 25.13 - Conditions to be satisfied
(1) The court may make an order for security for costs under rule 25.12 if –
- (a) it is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order; and
- (b)
	- (i) one or more of the conditions in paragraph (2) applies, or
	- (ii) an enactment permits the court to require security for costs.

(2) The conditions are –
- (a) the claimant is –
	- (i) resident out of the jurisdiction; but
	- (ii) not resident in a State bound by the 2005 Hague Convention, as defined in section 1(3) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 7;
- (c) the claimant is a company or other body (whether incorporated inside or outside Great Britain) and there is reason to believe that it will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if ordered to do so;
- (d) the claimant has changed his address since the claim was commenced with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation;
- (e) the claimant failed to give his address in the claim form, or gave an incorrect address in that form;
- (f) the claimant is acting as a nominal claimant, other than as a representative claimant under Part 19, and there is reason to believe that he will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if ordered to do so;
- (g) the claimant has taken steps in relation to his assets that would make it difficult to enforce an order for costs against him.

(Rule 3.4 allows the court to strike out a statement of case and Part 24 for it to give summary judgment)
```

### Purpose

Allows for a redistribution of costs, which can rack up very quickly. Better than being in a position where D has spent all their money on legal costs and does not have the funds to pay the final ordered damages.  

r 25.12(1): D may apply for security for their costs of the proceedings (note this includes a claimant defending a counterclaim).

### Discretionary Power

r 25.13(1): the court may make an order for security for costs if:

1. Considering all the circumstances, making such an order is just, and
2. At least one of Part 25 conditions are met (set out in rr 25.13 & 25.14). These include:
	1. Claimant resident outside of a 2005 Hague Convention State
		- Resident means where an individual claimant usually lives
			- Construed according to its ordinary and natural meaning
			- Includes, e.g., full-time education ([[R v Barnet LBC Ex p. Shah (Nilish) [1983] 2 A.C. 309]])
		- For a company, where the company's central management is located.
		- Where some claimants are resident out of the jurisdiction, but others are not, the court has jurisdiction to order security for costs based on all the circumstances of the case.
	2. Claimant in an impecunious company unlikely to be able to pay D's costs
		- D will produce evidence of poor credit ratings etc.
		- Court can make presumptions against a company which does not disclose its assets where there is no publicly available data.
		- D does not have to show on a balance of probabilities that claimant company will be unable to pay, but does need to give the court reason to believe company will be unable to pay ([[Jirehouse Capital v Beller [2008] EWCA Civ 908; [2009] 1 W.L.R. 751 ]])
		- Note, this is 'will be unable', rather than 'might be unable' ([[Re Unisoft Group (No.2) [1993] B.C.L.C. 532]])
		- A liquidator or receiver bringing proceedings in the name of an insolvent company is not under any duty to ensure that the company has sufficient funds to pay any costs awarded to the defendant.
	3. Claimant has taken steps to make enforcement difficult
		- See [[Ackerman v Ackerman [2012] 3 Costs LO 303]]
		- Objective test: what steps have the claimant taken in relation to their assets
		- No time limit for when steps were taken; could be before the commencement of proceedings.
		- But motive/ intention/ time of taking steps all relevant factors.
	4. Statutory provisions
		- s 70(6) of the Arbitration Act 1996 enables the court to grant security in relation to various applications to challenge an arbitration award or appeal on a point of law.

### Relevant Factors

1. Strength of claim and defence.
	- Any open admission or offer of settlement and any Part 36 offer made by the defendant will tend to undermine the application.
	- The true strength of each party’s case may not be easy to assess, and a detailed consideration of the merits is discouraged.
	- Merits of the case only relevant where it can be demonstrated that the party relying on merits could show a very high probability that the party would succeed ([[Porzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd [1987] 1 W.L.R. 420]])
2. Claimant's ability to provide security.
	- The court must strike a balance between the right of the claimant to pursue a genuine claim and the unfairness to the defendant of allowing the claimant to do so without providing security.
	- If the effect of an order for security would be to prevent the respondent to application from continuing its claim, then security should not be ordered.
		- Making an order which the claimant cannot meet could breach their right to a fair trial (Art 6(1) ECHR).
		- Burden of proving that an order for security will **stifle** the claim lies on the claimant on a balance of probabilities ([[Al-Koronky v Time Life Entertainment Group Ltd [2005] EWHC 1688 (QB)]])
	- Cost of providing securities of different types is relevant.
	- D unlikely to be able to persuade the court to order security where the claimant is funding litigation by a CFA.
3. Causes of impecuniosity
	- V may be able to persuade the court that shortage of money is caused by D's behaviour.
4. Property within jurisdiction
	- If C has substantial property of a permanent or fixed nature within the jurisdiction, unlikely that a security will be granted, since the property should be adequate security.
	- The court will not infer the existence of a real risk that assets within this country will be dissipated or shipped abroad to avoid their being available to satisfy a judgment for costs unless there is reason to question the probity of the claimant.
5. Timing of application
	- As soon as practicable.
	- Allowing a very late claim for security of costs could be disproportionate under Art 6 ECHR.
6. Counter-claim
	- The court may refuse to order security for costs in respect of a claim where the same issues arise on a counterclaim in the same proceedings ([_BJ Crabtree (Insulation) Ltd v GPT Communications Systems (1990) 59 B.L.R. 43, CA_](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1993253243&pubNum=4667&originatingDoc=I32D50AF055AF11E797D3B1B628A5D84C&refType=UC&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&ppcid=8dad670bb95640e991013ba44df97305&contextData=(sc.Category))).
	- Undesirability of one-sided litigation.
	- Where a claim and counterclaim both have independent vitality and each side can establish grounds for security against the other, the court will normally make orders for security against both sides or neither side.

### Procedure

- Make application for security as soon as facts justifying application are apparent
- For other applications, applicant encouraged to indicate they intend to apply on directions questionnaire.
- D should write to claimant and ask for voluntary security, before going ahead with a court order.
- Application must be supported by written evidence.
- D usually applies in relation to costs already incurred and estimated future costs.

### Form and Effect of Order

Order will specify:

- Amount of security
- Date by which claimant must provide it
- Form it must take.
	- Most commonly, C required to make a payment into court.
	- Security held by D's solicitor
	- Banker's draft or guarantee.
	- Charge over C's property ([[Xhosa Office Rentals Ltd v Multi High Tec PCB Ltd]])
	- Suitable undertaking to the court.

```ad-question
title: What if C fails to provide the security by the date ordered?
No CPR rule, but court will usually order that the claim is struck out and D entitled to apply for judgment to be entered and costs assessed. 
```

### Security Under R 3.1(5)

The court has the **discretionary power** under r 3.1(5) to order a party to **make a payment into court** if that party has, without good reason, failed to comply with a rule, Practice Direction or pre-action protocol.

The court will have regard to:

- Amount in dispute
- Costs the parties have incurred or may incur in future (r 3.1(6))
- Ability of the party to apply for relief under r 3.

Such orders are rare, and tends to be in cases of repeated breaches/ bad faith.

# Case Management

## Court's Powers

The court has a duty to manage cases actively:

```ad-statute
title: r 1.4 CPR 1998
(1) The court must further the overriding objective by actively managing cases.

(2) Active case management includes —
- (a) encouraging the parties to co-operate with each other in the conduct of the proceedings;
- (b) identifying the issues at an early stage;
- (c) deciding promptly which issues need full investigation and trial and accordingly disposing summarily of the others;
- (d) deciding the order in which issues are to be resolved;
- (e) encouraging the parties to use an alternative dispute resolution(GL) procedure if the court considers that appropriate and facilitating the use of such procedure;
- (f) helping the parties to settle the whole or part of the case;
- (g) fixing timetables or otherwise controlling the progress of the case;
- (h) considering whether the likely benefits of taking a particular step justify the cost of taking it;
- (i) dealing with as many aspects of the case as it can on the same occasion;
- (j) dealing with the case without the parties needing to attend at court;
- (k) making use of technology; and
- (l) giving directions to ensure that the trial of a case proceeds quickly and efficiently.
```

r 3.1(2): lists many of the court's powers. The court can make any order subject to conditions and can specify the consequence of non-compliance.

Under r 3.1(5) the court may make an order that a party pay a sum of money into court pending the outcome of proceedings if that party has failed to comply with a rule/ PD/ pre-action protocol without good reason. The court must have regard to both the amount in dispute and the costs the parties have/ will incur.

### Striking Out Statement of Case

```ad-statute
title: r 3.4(2) CPR 1998
The court may strike out a statement of case if it appears to the court –
- (a) that the statement of case discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending the claim;
- (b) that the statement of case is an abuse of the court’s process or is otherwise likely to obstruct the just disposal of the proceedings; or
- (c) that there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order.
```

This is frequently used when a statement of case is vague/ incoherent, or where the facts disclosed do not disclose any legally recognisable claim. If a statement of case is salvageable through amendment, the court may give a part the opportunity to do this.

The court may make such an order on its own volition/ following an application to court by the other party. If D did not comply with the order, then the claimant would be able to obtain judgment simply by filing a request for judgment (stating that the right to enter judgment has arisen because the court's order has not been obeyed). D could then apply to court under r 3.6 for the judgment to be set aside, not after 14 days after judgment served. r 3.9 sets out relief from sanctions.

### Non-compliance with rule/ PD/ Court Order

Valid grounds for striking out a statement of case. But other sanctions also available. So which sanction should be used when?

- Starting point: there are less drastic but equally effective ways of dealing with a failure to comply with CPR/ court orders ([[Biguzzi v Rank Leisure plc [1999] 1 WLR 1926]], which in many cases would produce a more just result.
- All circumstances are considered, particularly factors relevant to r 3.9.
- Overriding objective and duty to ensure fairness, a central consideration in the exercise of the court's discretion.
- Striking out a case because of procedural irregularities may violate Article 6(1) ECHR right to a fair trial.
- So striking out used where default is so bad it amounts to abuse of court/ where it is no longer possible to have a fair trial.

### Other Sanctions

| Sanction       | Details                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Costs          | Require the party in default to pay the other party's costs occasioned by the delay on an indemnity basis. |
| Interest       | Court may make orders affecting the interest payable on any damages subsequently awarded to C.             |
| Limited issues | Limiting the issues which are allowed to proceed to trial.                                                 |

### Unless Order

```ad-question
title: A party has not taken a step in proceedings according to a court order, what should the other party do?
1. Chase up the defaulting party in correspondence. 
2. Apply to the court for an unless order. 
	- Do this promptly
	- First warn the other party of intention to do so.
```

PD 28 para 5.1:

> [w]here a party has failed to comply with a direction given by the court, any other party may apply for an order to enforce compliance or for a sanction to be imposed or both of these.

If the other party cannot make the deadline set by an unless order, should apply to the court to have it extended, since the strike out takes effect without any other order.

## Relief From Sanctions

### Timing

If a Rule/ PD/ court order requires a party to do something in a specific time, this time can be extended by up to 28 days by agreement between the parties, unless explicitly prohibited by the court/ risks breaking hearing date (r 3.8(4)).

### Relevant Factors

By r 3.9(1), where a party applies for relief from any sanction for failure to comply with any  
rule, practice direction or court order, the court will consider all the circumstances of the  
case, so as to enable it to deal justly with the application, including the need:

1. for litigation to be conducted efficiently and at proportionate cost; and
2. to enforce compliance with rules, practice directions and orders.

### Denton

```ad-test
title: Denton test
The test was established in [[Denton v TH White Ltd [2014] EWCA Civ 906]] as follows:
1. Identify and assess the seriousness or significance of the relevant failure. If a breach was not serious or significant, relief would usually be granted and there would be no need to spend much time on the second and third stages.
2. Consider why the failure or default occurred.
3. Evaluate ‘all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable [the court] to deal justly with the application’.
```

- The court normally considers as one of the relevant circumstances of the case the defaulter’s previous conduct in the litigation, including any non-compliance with court orders.
- A party might be penalised if they sought to take advantage of a mistake by an opponent where the failure was neither serious nor significant. Opposing an application for relief would be viewed as a breach of r 1.3, which requires parties to help the court to further the **overriding objective**.
- Breaches which affect the effective timetabling of cases are likely to be considered significant.
- Lack of promptness in applying for relief may often be a critical factor.

## Directions Questionnaire

Allocation is dealt with by Part 26 CPR 1998. Timeline:

- Defence served
- Court serves on each party a notice of the proposed allocation (Form 149A/ N149B/ N149C for small claims/ fast-track/ multi-track).
- Parties file and serve answers to 'directions questionnaire' (form N181, or N180 if small claims track provisionally allocated).
	- Directions questionnaire available online, legal representatives should download and fill this in unprompted.
- If multi-track provisionally allocated, also send:
	- Case summary (if case management conference)
	- Disclosure report
	- Costs budget
	- Budget discussion report.

### Completing Questionnaire

Form N181 must be completed by each party and filed by the set date. Parties should consult one another and cooperate in completing the questionnaire.

r 26.3(6A): the date for filing **cannot** be varied by agreement between the parties. Divided into 10 sections.

| Directions questionnaire section   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Part A Settlement                  | Parties reminded that they should try to settle a case, and that answers will impact costs decision. Parties must indicate if they want to try to settle (one month stay of proceedings). Or court can order a stay on its own initiative. Parties can request the court to arrange a mediation appointment. |
| Part B Court                       | Asks parties whether there is any reason to be heard in a particular court, along with reasons. Special provisions if claim issued at Central Office of Royal Courts of Justice (RCJ).                                                                                                                       |
| Part C Pre-action protocols        | Have parties complied with pre-action protocols, if not then why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Part D Case management information | Asks parties if they have made an application to the court. Relevant to allocating a track: the largest of the claims/ counterclaims will determine the track which the case is placed on. More questions if multi-track allocation (e.g., about disclosure of electronic documents).                        |
| Part E Experts                     | Parties should indicate if they wis hto rely on expert evidence at trial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Part F Witnesses                   | Parties name witnesses of fact they intend to call at trial, and identify facts each witness will address. But not obliged to 'name names', can just say number of witnesses. Court can limit numbers.                                                                                                       |
| Part G Trial                       | Parties give a realistic estimate of how long the trial will last.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Part H Costs                       | If multi-track, legal advisers should file and serve a costs budged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Transfer of Money Claims

r 26.2: automatic transfer of High Court proceedings where:

- The claim is for a specified amount of money,
- D an individual
- Claim commenced in a court other than D's home court.

When a defence is filed, the claim will be sent to D's home court.

r 26.2A: transfer of money claims within the County Court–similar provisions.

If proceedings are transferred, the court in which the proceedings commenced will serve the notice of proposed allocation before the proceedings are transferred and will not transfer proceedings until all parties have complied with the notice/ time for doing so expired.

### Failure to File Directions Questionnaire

#### [[County Court]] Money Claim

If r 26.2A applies, and any party does not comply with notice of proposed allocation, the court will serve a further notice, requiring compliance within 7 days. If they still don't comply, the party's statement of case is struck out automatically without a further court order.

#### Other Claims

If a party fails to comply with the notice of proposed allocation, the court makes an order it considers appropriate. This may include: (i) an order for directions; (ii) an order striking out the claim; (iii) an order striking out the defence and entering judgment; or (iv) listing the case for a case management conference.

#### Exchanging Questionnaires

Parties must exchange questionnaires–check for any new info.

## Allocation of Track

Most important factor is the value of the claim. But the court also takes into account other factors (r 26.8(1)).

MERMAID3

```ad-statute
title: r 16.8(1) CPR 1998
When deciding the track for a claim, the matters to which the court shall have regard include –
- (a) the financial value, if any, of the claim;
- (b) the nature of the remedy sought;
- (c) the likely complexity of the facts, law or evidence;
- (d) the number of parties or likely parties;
- (e) the value of any counterclaim or other Part 20 claim and the complexity of any matters relating to it;
- (f) the amount of oral evidence which may be required;
- (g) the importance of the claim to persons who are not parties to the proceedings;
- (h) the views expressed by the parties; and
- (i) the circumstances of the parties.
```

```ad-statute
title: r 26.8(2)
It is for the court to assess the financial value of a claim and in doing so it will disregard –
- (a) any amount not in dispute;
- (b) any claim for interest;
- (c) costs; and
- (d) any contributory negligence.
```

The fast track is the normal track for claims with a value exceeding £10,000, but not £25,000, only if the trial is likely to last for no longer than one day; oral expert evidence at trial will be limited to no more than one expert per party in relation to any expert field and there will be expert evidence in no more than two expert fields.

PD 26, para 8.1(2): the court may allocate a claim to the small claims track even if it exceeds £10,000.

If a party is dissatisfied, may appeal/ apply to the court for reallocation of the claim (PD 26 para 11).

### Part 27: Small Claims Track

Aims are to process claims quickly at minimal cost.

```ad-statute
title: PD 26 para 8(1)
- (a) The small claims track is intended to provide a proportionate procedure by which most straightforward claims with a financial value of not more than £10,000 can be decided, without the need for substantial pre-hearing preparation and the formalities of a traditional trial, and without incurring large legal costs.
- (b) The procedures laid down in Part 27 for the preparation of the case and the conduct of the hearing are designed to make it possible for a litigant to conduct their own case without legal representation if they wish.
- (c) Cases generally suitable for the small claims track will include consumer disputes, accident claims, disputes about the ownership of goods, and most disputes between a landlord and tenant other than those for possession.
- (d) A case involving a disputed allegation of dishonesty will not usually be suitable for the small claims track.
```

All claims other than road traffic accidents, personal injury or housing disrepair will be  
referred to the Small Claims Mediation Service if all parties consent to referral in their  
directions' questionnaire. If the claim is settled, proceeds automatically stayed (r 26.4A(5)).

In most cases, the court will order standard direction s and fix a date for the final hearing. Rare for there to be a preliminary hearing. By r 27.2(3), the court may of its own initiative order a party to provide further information. Under r 27.14, the costs which can be recovered by a successful party are extremely limited.

Standard directions which a court gives set out in PD 27 appendices. The hearing will be informal, and if all parties agree, the court can deal with the claim without a hearing (i.e., just based on the statements of case).

r 27.14: generally, the only costs recoverable are the fixed costs attributable to issuing the claim, any court fees paid and sums to represent travelling expenses and loss of earnings or leave.

### Part 28: Fast Track

Generally, the court will allocate a case to this track without a hearing and order standard directions.

General timetable:

| Event                                                     | Period from date of allocation |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Disclosure                                                | 4 weeks                        |
| Exchange of witness statements                            | 10 weeks                       |
| Exchange of experts' reports                              | 14 weeks                       |
| Court sends pre-trial checklist, listing questionnaires   | 20 weeks                       |
| Parties file pre-trial checklists, listing questionnaires | 22 weeks                       |
| Hearing                                                   | 30 weeks                               |

#### Varying Directions

- To vary certain directions, an application must be made to the court (r 28.4):
	- The return of a pre-trial checklist
	- Trial
	- Trial period.
- Also, parties cannot agree to vary any matter which would alter these dates.
- Apply ASAP (PD 28 para 4.2(1))–and at least within 14 days (para 4.2(2)).

#### Variation by Consent

If agreement relates to an act which does not need the court's consent, parties need not file written agreement to vary. Else, apply to court for an order by consent. File a draft of the order sought and agreed statement of the reasons why.

#### Failure to Comply

PD 28 para 5: if a party fails to comply with a direction, another party may apply for an order enforcing compliance/ for sanctions.

This will only exceptionally lead to a postponement of the trial date (para 5.4(1)). Court may order that the trial continue for issues which can be resolved.

```ad-tip
The trial date is sacrosanct. 
```

#### Exchange of Witness Statements & Reports

Usually exchanged simultaneously. The court will not make a direction giving permission for an expert to give oral evidence unless it believes that it is necessary in the interests of justice to do so (PD 28, para 7.2(4)(b) and r 35.5(2)). Usual provision is expert evidence by written reports. Often a single joint expert is appointed.

#### Pre-trial Checklist (PD 28 Para 6)

```ad-guid
title: Purpose
To check that directions have been complied with so the court can fix a date for trial.
```

The court will specify when to return the pre-trial checklist ( $\geq 8$ weeks before trial). Form N170 used. Parties encouraged to exchange before filing.

#### Listing Directions (PD 28 Para 7)

The court will confirm or fix the date, length and place of the trial. Normally $\geq 3$ weeks notice of trial. Parties should try to agree directions, including

- (a) evidence;
- (b) a trial timetable and time estimate;
- (c) preparation of a trial bundle.
	- Should be lodged with court $3\leq \text{days} \leq 7$ before trial.
	- Should include 250 word case summary, agreed by parties if possible.

The court may fix a listing hearing on three days’ notice if either:

- (a) a party has failed to file the pre-trial checklist; or
- (b) a party has filed an incomplete pre-trial checklist; or
- (c) a hearing is needed to decide what directions for trial are appropriate.

### Part 29: Multi-track

#### Directions

Court will either:

- Give directions and set a timetable
	- PD 29 para 410
	- General approach is to give directions and maximise reconciliation.
- Fix a case management conference/ pre-trial review, and give directions it sees fit.

No deadline for the trial date.

The starting point for drafting case management directions will be relevant model standard directions. It is usual for the last direction to require the parties to ‘inform the court immediately if the claim is settled, whether or not it is then possible to file a draft consent order to give effect to their agreement’.

#### Case Management Conference

```ad-statute
title: PD 29 para 5.1
The court will at any case management conference:

(1) review the steps which the parties have taken in the preparation of the case, and in particular their compliance with any directions that the court may have given,

(2) decide and give directions about the steps which are to be taken to secure the progress of the claim in accordance with the overriding objective, and

(3) ensure as far as it can that all agreements that can be reached between the parties about the matters in issue and the conduct of the claim are made and recorded.
```

Court will consider (PD 29 para 5.3):

- Whether each party has clearly stated their case
- Whether any amendments to any documents needed
- Necessary disclosure of documents
- Expert evidence reasonably required
- Factual evidence to disclose
- Arrangements about further info/ questioning experts
- Whether to order a split trial on one or more issue.

##### Who Should Attend

- r 29.3(2): representative familiar with the case must attend the case management conference.
- PD 29, para 5.2(2): the representative should be someone who is personally involved in the conduct of the case, and who has both the authority and information available to deal with any matter that may reasonably be expected to be dealt with.
- PD 29 para 5.2(3): where the inadequacy of the person attending, or of their instructions, leads to the adjournment of a hearing, the court will expect to make a wasted costs order.
- May also be SRA implications: principle 7 (client's best interest), principle 1 (proper administration of justice) .

##### Expert Evidence

```ad-statute
title: PD 29 para 5.5
1. The court will not at this stage give permission to use expert evidence unless it can identify each expert by name or field in its order and say whether his evidence is to be given orally or by the use of his report.
2. A party who obtains expert evidence before obtaining a direction about it does so at his own risk as to costs, except where he obtained the evidence in compliance with a pre-action protocol.
```

##### Preparing

```ad-statute
title: PD 29 para 5.6
To assist the court, the parties and their legal advisers should:
1. ensure that all documents that the court is likely to ask to see (including witness statements and experts’ reports) are brought to the hearing,
2. consider whether the parties should attend,
3. consider whether a case summary will be useful, and
4. consider what orders each wishes to be made and give notice of them to the other parties.
```

##### Case Summary

```ad-statute
title: PD 29 para 5.7
(1) A case summary:
- (a) should be designed to assist the court to understand and deal with the questions before it,
- (b) should set out a brief chronology of the claim, the issues of fact which are agreed or in dispute and the evidence needed to decide them,
- (c) should not normally exceed 500 words in length, and
- (d) should be prepared by the claimant and agreed with the other parties if possible.
```

The case summary is meant to assist the judge to identify issues in dispute. In the case summary, parties can name witnesses, or just say how many will likely be used and fields of expertise.

#### Variation of Directions

A party must apply to the court if they wish to vary the date which the court has fixed for:

- (a) a case management conference;
- (b) a pre-trial review;
- (c) the return of a pre-trial checklist under r 29.6;
- (d) the trial; or
- (e) the trial period.

A party wishing to vary a direction must apply asap. There is an appeals process - the court will give all parties 3 days' notice of any associated hearing.

#### Non-compliance with Directions (PD 29 Para 7)

The other party can apply for an order for compliance/ sanctions.

#### Pre-trial Checklist (PD 29 Para 8)

Again, deadline $\geq 8$ weeks before trial, and parties given $\geq 14$ days to complete pre-trial checklist. Parties encouraged to exchange copies.

On receipt of pre-trial checklists, the court may decide to hold a pre-trial review (with $\geq 7$ days notice). Standard practice in complex cases.

As soon as practicable after pre-trial checklists/ listing hearing/ pre-trial review, court will set a timetable and notify parties.

## Costs Management

### Costs Budgets

Parties provide budgets in a prescribed form of their own future costs. These are updated regularly and submitted for agreement to the party, and then to the court for adjudication in case of dispute.

Courts make a **costs management order** to ensure **future** costs are reasonable and do not become disproportionate. Not possible to incur costs and then put them in a budget.

#### Scope

- r 3.12(1) limits costs management to all multi-track cases where the amount of money claimed is less than £10 million.
- A litigant in person does not have to prepare a budget or file a budget discussion report.

#### Timing

The court will set a date for filling costs budget.

| Size of claim      | Deadline for filing costs budget       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Claims $< £50,000$ | When directions questionnaire is filed |
| Other claims       | 21 days before first case management conference.                                        |

#### Contents

- Details of costs already incurred
- Estimate of future costs
- Assumptions on which future costs are based
- Any ADR or settlement discussions.

The above are known as 'phases'. Budget must be verified by a statement of truth by a senior lawyer. The Statement of Truth to be completed for a budget should read: "This budget is a fair and accurate statement of incurred and estimated costs which it would be reasonable and proportionate for my client to incur in this litigation." See Appendix A(9) for Precedent H.

#### Budget Discussion Report

Parties should complete a budget discussion report (Precedent R), filed $\geq 7$ days before first case management conference. Sets out:

- Figures agreed for each phase
- Figures not agreed
- Summary of grounds of dispute.

The court will review this if there are entire phases not agreed upon.

#### Subsequent Changes in Figures

Difficult to persuade a court to rectify a costs budget. Budget must be revised if there is a "significant development". Significance must be decided upon in light of all the circumstances.

- Starting point: last approved budget.
- The court can challenge.
- Amended budget must use Precedent T.

#### Failure to File Budget

r 3.14: unless the court orders otherwise, any party who fails to file a budget despite  
being required to do so, will be treated as having filed a budget comprising only the applicable court fees: in effect, only the court fees incurred by the defaulting party may potentially be recoverable under a costs order in the future. This can subsequently be eased.

#### Costs of Preparing Budget

Recoverable costs cannot exceed £1,000/ 1% of approved budget. All budgeting and costs management costs cannot exceed 2% of approved budget.

### Judicial Approach

Parties encouraged to agree budgets when possible. "Reasonable and proportionate" construed loosely - lawyers are hella expensive. The court may not approve costs incurred before the date of any budget.

### Practical Points

- After a budget has been approved, party must re-file and re-serve the budget.
- r 3.18: A costs management order will affect a party who secures a standard basis costs order in the litigation, since standard basis costs are assessed with reference to the submitted budget. Cannot be departed from unless there is good reason. Costs outside the phases will be subject to detailed assessment.
- If no costs management order has been made, and there is a difference of $\geq 20\%$ between the costs claimed by a receiving party /costs shown in a budget, then the receiving party must provide reasons for the difference. If the court thinks this is unreasonable, they can choose the recoverable costs.
