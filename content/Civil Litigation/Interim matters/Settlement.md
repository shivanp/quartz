## Pre-action Settlements

### Costs and Interest

When a settlement is reached prior to the issue of proceedings, the prospective claimant will not be entitled to recover their legal costs unless this has been agreed. Neither will they be entitled to interest on any sum agreed under s 69 of the CCA 1984, or s 35A of the SCA 1981.

There may, however, be an entitlement to interest under contract or the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, and such should be taken into account during any negotiations and as part of any settlement.

### Recording Pre-action Settlement

Record settlement terms in writing for safety. An exchange of correspondence is usually fine, but for complicated stuff sign a formal settlement agreement.

Take care to ensure that all necessary terms are included in any offer to settle ([[Evans v Trebuchet Design Ltd [2020] EWHC 3037 (IPEC)]]). Remember non-disclosure clauses, if applicable.

## Settlements After Proceedings

Preferable for the settlement to be recorded in a court order or judgment, to make enforcement easier. The date by which debt/ damages must be paid should be specified in the judgment/ order. Unless the settlement provides otherwise, interest is not payable on costs until judgment is entered.

### Consent Orders or Judgments

Where none of the parties is a litigant in person, it will often be possible to avoid an application to the court by drawing up a consent order or judgment for sealing by a court officer under r 40.6.

The court has theoretical power not to approve a proposed order, but will only be referred to a judge if it appears incorrect/ unclear.

```ad-test
title: Formalities for a consent order: r 40.6(7)
1. the order agreed by the parties must be drawn up in the terms agreed;
2. it must be expressed as being ‘By Consent’;
3. it must be signed by the legal representative acting for each of the parties to whom the order relates.
```

```ad-important
1. The terms of a consent order will be open to public inspection. 
2. The terms agreed must be within the powers of a court to order. 
```

If the parties want any terms to be confidential and/or beyond the powers of a court to order, they should use a Tomlin order.

### Tomlin Orders

A Tomlin order **stays the claim on agreed terms** that are set out in a schedule to the order, an agreement annexed to the order or a separate document.

```ad-tip
The key to drafting a Tomlin order correctly is to appreciate that certain terms must appear in the order itself, whilst others can be put in the schedule, agreement or separate document.
```

which comes from:

```ad-statute
title: PD 40B, para 3.5
Where the parties draw up a consent order in the form of a stay of proceedings on agreed terms, disposing of the proceedings, and where the terms are recorded in a schedule to the order, any direction for:
1. payment of money out of court, or
2. payment and assessment of costs

should be contained in the body of the order and not in the schedule.
```

Where one party is to pay another party’s costs and/or the parties want the amount of those costs assessed by the court (known as a *detailed assessment*), that direction must go in the order.

When assessing payment of costs, ask

- Why pays?
- For what?
- How much?
- By when?

Moreover, because there is a possibility that a party may not perform its part of the agreement, the order should include a provision that any party is at liberty to apply for the stay to be lifted so that the court can enforce the settlement. This means that it is not necessary to start new proceedings to enforce the terms ([[Trebisol Sud Ouest SAS v Berkley Finance Ltd [2021] EWHC 2494 (QB)]]).

#### Degrees of Confidentiality

Whether the terms of the settlement are recorded in a schedule to the Tomlin order, an agreement annexed to the document or a separate document depends largely on the degree of confidentiality required.

```ad-statute
Under r 5.4B and r 5.4C, parties and non-parties can apply for permission to obtain copies of documents filed with the court.
```

Therefore, the only way to ensure complete confidentiality is to **record the settlement in a separate document which is referred to in the schedule and clearly identifiable but not filed with the court**. In [[Zenith Logistics Services (UK) Ltd & Others v Coury [2020] EWHC 774 (QB)]], the court confirmed that the fact the terms were referred to but not set out in the schedule was entirely unobjectionable. The reason was to preserve confidentiality so that the terms were not accessible to third parties. And there was no breach of the ‘open justice’ principle.

#### Summary

Points to consider when drafting order/ schedule:

| Order | Schedule/Annexed Agreement/Separate Document |
|:--------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 'By Consent' | Include any agreed term that court could not order |
| Stay of proceedings | Any payment of money should include provision for interest on late payment |
| Liberty to apply |                                                                            |
| Payment of money out of court |                                                                            |
| Payment of costs |                                                                            |
| Detailed assessment of costs |                                                                            |
| Signed by the parties' solicitors | |

## Part 36

![[part36-diagram.png]]

Before litigation starts, parties can make 'without prejudice' offers to settle. If proceedings issued, continually review the case.

- r 36.7(1): a Part 36 offer may be made both before and during proceedings.
- r 44.2: the court will take into account when deciding the issue of costs any admissible offer to settle that has been made.
- r 36.16(1): a Part 36 offer will be treated as ‘without prejudice except as to costs’.

Part 36 offer has been made must not normally be communicated to the trial judge (or to any judge allocated in advance to conduct the trial) until the case has been decided.

```ad-warning
If a defendant makes a Part 36 offer and the claimant fails to obtain a judgment more advantageous than that offer, the claimant will usually suffer severe financial penalties
```

### Form and Content

r 36.5(1):

1. be in writing;
2. make clear that it is made pursuant to Part 36;
3. specify a period of not less than 21 days during which, if the offeree accepts the offer, the defendant will pay the claimant’s costs under r 36.13 (known as ‘the relevant period’);
4. state whether it relates to the whole of the claim or to part of it; and
5. state whether it takes into account any counterclaim.

But it is not part of this mandatory requirement, once the period has been specified, to state expressly that this is the period ‘within which the defendant will be liable for the claimant’s costs in accordance with rule 36.13 if the offer is accepted’. If an offeree receives a Part 36 offer and they wish to challenge the validity of the offer, they should do so without delay.

Part 36 offers are made by a claimant and/or a defendant in a monetary claim to settle the claim on payment of a lump sum. r 36.6, a Part 36 offer by a defendant to pay a sum of money in settlement of a claim must be an offer to pay a single sum of money. Under r 36.5(5), ‘a Part 36 offer to accept a sum of money may make provision for accrual of interest on such sum after the date specified in paragraph (4).

#### >1 Offer

Can make multiple offers. If none is accepted, the financial consequences of r 36.17 will be imposed on the defendant should the claimant secure a judgment that is at least as advantageous to them as the proposals contained in one of their Part 36 offers.

A Part 36 offer is not like an offer in the ordinary law of contract where an offer which is rejected, either expressly or by the making of a counter-offer, cannot subsequently be accepted. That is not true of a Part 36 offer, which may be accepted even after the offeree has put forward a different proposal.

### Offers Made Close to Trial

As the relevant period is a minimum of 21 days, can an offer be made less than 21 days before the start of a trial?

- r 36.3(g)(ii): the relevant period is the period up to the end of the trial.
- r 36.5(4)(b): such an offer is deemed inclusive of interest up to a date 21 days after the offer was made.
- If the trial starts then, by r 36.11(3)(d), the offeree will need the court’s permission to accept the Part 36 offer.

### Offer Made When Served

r 36.7(2): Part 36 offer is made when served on the offeree. If the offeree is legally represented, the offer must be served on solicitors. The usual rules of deemed service apply.

### Withdrawal or Changing Terms

r 36.10(3): possible to withdraw/ change terms only if court agrees. The offeror must serve written notice of the withdrawal or change of terms on the offeree. This can be done by letter.

Suppose a defendant wishes to decrease the amount they previously offered. They should serve a notice of variation of the original offer under r 36.9(4). This preserves the relevant period of the original offer for the purpose of costs where the offeree fails to beat the less advantageous offer.

```ad-important
By r 36.17(7), where a Part 36 offer is withdrawn or its terms made less advantageous to the offeree, and the offeree has beaten the less advantageous offer, the financial consequences of r 36.17 will not apply to it.
```

### Clarification

Where monetary and/or non-monetary remedies are sought, it is possible that an offeree may not be clear about the terms proposed. By r 36.8, an offeree may, within seven days of receiving a Part 36 offer, request clarification from the offeror. Best practice to make request in writing. 21 days minimum is given to an offeree to accept a Part 36 offer. After this, offeree may accept offer but suffer a costs penalty.

### Acceptance

- A Part 36 offer may be accepted at any time, whether or not the offeree has subsequently made a different offer, unless the offeror has served notice of withdrawal of that offer on the offeree.
- r 36.11(1): an offeree can accept a Part 36 offer by serving written notice of the acceptance on the offeror.
- No prescribed form.
- If proceedings have started, must also file with the court (PD 36 para 3.1).
- r 21.10: acceptance on behalf of a child/ protected party is not valid unless the court has approved the settlement.

#### Consequence

Where a Part 36 offer is accepted, **the claim is stayed**. This does not affect the power of the court to enforce the terms of a Part 36 offer and deal with any question of costs.

```ad-question
title: Is an agreement reached by the acceptance of a Part 36 offer void if that Part 36 offer was a clear and obvious mistake that was appreciated by the Part 36 offeree at the point of acceptance? 
Yes, and to that extent the doctrine of common law mistake can apply to a Part 36 offer ([[O’Grady v B15 Group Ltd [2022] EWHC 67 (QB)]]).
```

Where a claimant accepts a defendant’s Part 36 offer that is, or includes, an offer to pay a  
single sum of money, that sum must be paid to the claimant within **14 days** of the date of  
acceptance. If the accepted sum is not paid within 14 days, the claimant may enter judgment for the unpaid sum.

#### Costs Consequences

Where a defendant’s Part 36 offer is accepted by the claimant within the relevant period, the claimant is entitled to their costs of the proceedings up to the date on which notice of acceptance is served on the defendant.

![[part36-acceptance-consequences.png]]

Where a claimant’s Part 36 offer is accepted by the defendant within the relevant period, the claimant is entitled to their costs of the proceedings up to the date on which notice of acceptance is served on the claimant.

![[part36-2.png]]

#### Late Acceptance

If a claimant accepts D's offer 'late' (after the relevant period specified in the offer has expired) and the parties cannot agree on costs, the court will make an order.

r 36.13(5): unless the court considers it unjust to do so:

1. the defendant will be ordered to pay the claimant’s costs of the proceedings up to the date on which the relevant period expired; and
2. the claimant will be ordered to pay the defendant’s costs for the period from the date of expiry of the relevant period to the date of acceptance.

![[part36-3.png]]

For these purposes, the claimant’s costs include any costs incurred in dealing with a defendant’s counterclaim if the Part 36 offer states that it takes that into account.

The presumption is that the price of late acceptance for a claimant is to pay the defendant’s costs on the standard basis from when the relevant period expired until the date of acceptance. The court must guard against making an exception from the norm on the grounds that the regime itself is harsh or unjust, but must find something about the particular circumstances of the case which takes it out of the norm. Remember, the purpose of Part 36 is to promote compromise and avoid unnecessary expenditure of costs and court time.

- The burden is on the claimant to show injustice.
- Only in exceptional circumstances will the court not require the claimant to make the payment of costs under r 26.13(5)(b).
- Particular care should be taken when making a Part 36 offer to a litigant in person, to draw special attention to the provision.
- A claimant can also be ordered to pay D's costs incurred (indemnity basis) between expiry of the relevant period and acceptance.

### Part 36 Consequences at Trial

- If claimant at trial/ summary judgment gets a more advantageous offer, D pays amount of judgment and usually V's costs on a standard basis.
- If V fails to obtain a better judgment than that Part 36, the court will usually make a split costs order r 36.17(3).

### 'Like for Like' Comparison

To make a like-for-like comparison between the Part 36 offer and (judgment + interest + costs):

- Calculate interest that would have accrued on the sum awarded by the judge from the date it becomes payable < period $\leq$ end of relevant period (normally day 21)
- Add this to amount of judgment.

### Split Costs Order

Court must, unless unjust, order that D entitled to costs from expiry of relevant period + interests on costs (r 36.17(3)).

The usual costs order is that the losing party should pay the winning party's costs, and interest on costs is normally payable from the day of judgment.

Effects of r 36.17(3) is:

1. D pays V's costs from when those costs were first incurred until the relevant period expired (21 days, usually)
2. V pays D's costs from expiry of relevant period (day 22) until judgment. Costs should be agreed by the parties, or otherwise will be assessed on the standard basis. Also pays **interest** on these costs from when each item was incurred.

```ad-question
title: Why is the standard basis rather than the indemnity basis used as the starting point for r 36.16(3)(a)?
Indemnity costs only appropriate when conduct of a paying party is unreasonable to a high degree. So there must be something taking the case outside the norm. Ask: was there a point when the reasonable claimant would have concluded that the offer represented a better outcome than the likely outcome at trial. 
```

So the pursuit of a weak claim will not normally, on its own, justify an order for indemnity costs. But pursuit of a hopeless claim may lead to an order. Interest is not payable on costs until after judgment. This is usually at the normal commercial rate.

![[part36-4.png]]

#### Claimant Who Loses at Trial

What if the claimant fails to establish liability and so is awarded no sum of money? The normal court order would be for the claimant to pay D's costs from when these were first incurred by D to judgment. But because of the Part 36 order, D should argue that the claimant should pay interest on D's costs, from when the relevant period for acceptance of the offer expired.

![[part36-5.png]]

### Tactical Considerations

A Part 36 offer can provide a useful mechanism for pressurising the claimant to accept a reasonable settlement. The earlier a Part 36 offer is made, the greater the potential costs protection for D.

### Part 36 Consequences at Trial of Claimant Offer

If judgment against D is at least as advantageous as V's Part 36, court must order that V is entitled to:

1. Interest for some/ all of the period starting **on** the date the relevant period expired ($\leq 10\% +$ base rate)
	- Common-sense reading = day 22
	- There is a cap on the amount of interest that can be awarded on damages by the trial judge and under r 36.17(4), which is 10% over base rate.
	- Enhanced interest: Award of interest on damages under r 36.17(4)
	- The level of interest awarded must be proportionate to the circumstances of the case.
2. Costs on the indemnity basis, **from** date on which the relevant period expired
	- Starts running day 22
	- Principles from [[OMV Petrom SA v Glencore International AG [2017] EWCA Civ 195]]
		- 10% is the starting point.
		- Aim is to provide penalties and rewards to encourage reasonable settlements being made.
		- Flexible to account for different factors.
3. Interest on costs ($\leq 10\% +$ base rate)
4. Additional amount $\leq £75,000$ calculated as a prescribed percentage.
	- Note interest should be included only where it arises under contract/ court's discretionary power.
	- Interest not payable on additional sum.

| Amount awarded by the court    | Prescribed percentage                                            |
|:------------------------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\leq £500,000$                | 10% of the amount awarded;                                       |
| $£500,000 < X \leq £1,000,000$ | 10% of the first £500,000 and 5% of any amount above that figure |
| $X > £100,000$                  | $£75,000$                                                                 |

#### Tactical Considerations

D refuses V's Part 36 and V obtains a judgment the same or better than Part 36 ⇾ D is likely to pay a heavy price. Whereas the other way around, V unlikely to pay a heavy price. So Part 36 has the effect of pressurising defendants.

```ad-action
Since the penalties in r 36.17(4) are imposed as from the expiry of the relevant period, the earlier the claimant makes their offer, the greater the pressure on the defendant.
```

Note that the court retains ultimate discretion; it can choose to award some of the s 36.17(4) penalties, but not others.

### “Advantageous”

Means better in monetary terms, by no matter how small an amount.

### Unjust Orders

Recall, a well-judged offer that is not accepted will lead to an order under r 36.17(3) or (4), unless it would be unjust for the court to make that order.

```ad-statute
title: r 36.17(5)
In considering whether it would be unjust to make the orders referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4), the court must take into account all the circumstances of the case including—
- (a) the terms of any Part 36 offer;
- (b) the stage in the proceedings when any Part 36 offer was made, including in particular how long before the trial started the offer was made;
- (c) the information available to the parties at the time when the Part 36 offer was made;
- (d) the conduct of the parties with regard to the giving of or refusal to give information for the purposes of enabling the offer to be made or evaluated; and
- (e) whether the offer was a genuine attempt to settle the proceedings.
```

Note these are just examples which do not constrain the creativity of the court.

```ad-warning
In determining whether or not it is unjust to make orders rr 36.17(3) & (4), the court cannot consider by how much the judgment against D was more advantageous than the Part 36 offer ([[JLE v Warrington & Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust [2019] EWHC 1582 (QB)]])
```

The test of unjustness should be separately applied to each of the four consequences.

Tactics: make a Part 36 offer for marginally less than the full sum claimed (0.3% in [[Rawbank SA v Travelex Banknotes Ltd [2020] EWHC 1619 (Ch)]]). Then if D rejects and you win the full amount, get bare costs.

### R 36.17(3) & CFA

| Scenario                                                                | Consequence                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| V rejects the offer on the basis of advice from the solicitors/ counsel | Success fee not payable on charges incurred after day 22 |
| V rejects offer against advice of solicitor/ counsel                    | Success fee payable.                                                         |

### Secrecy

Part 36 offer should not be revealed to the trial judge until all questions of liability and quantum have been decided (except in super rare cases). Part 36 offers are "without prejudice save as to costs" - this does not need to be said explicitly.

### Part 36 & Counterclaim

Rules still apply for counterclaim.

### Indemnity Vs Standard Basis

If costs are calculated on the standard basis, any ambiguity is resolved in favour of the paying party. But on the indemnity basis, ambiguities resolved in favour of the receiving party.
