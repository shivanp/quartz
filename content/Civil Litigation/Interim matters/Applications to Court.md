```toc
```

## General

General rules set out in Part 23 CPR 1998:

- Application to set aside default judgment (part 13)
- Application for summary judgment (part 24)
- Application for an interim injunction (part 25.1)
- Application for an interim payment on account of damages (part 25.6)
- Security for costs order (r 25.12)

### N244

**An application to the court is made by an application notice**: Form N244 should be used

_The person making the application is the applicant, and the party whom the order is sought is the respondent._

| Aspect                     | Rule            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Consent orders             |                 | If the parties have reached agreement on the order they wish the court to make, they can apply for an order to be made by consent without the need for attendance by the parties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Application without notice | PD 23A para 3   | Most applications must be made on notice.

When an order is made on an application without notice to the respondent, a copy of the order must be served on the respondent, together with a copy of the application notice and the supporting evidence. The respondent may then apply to set aside or vary the order within seven days of service of the order on them. |

### Telephone hearings/ Video Conferencing

Many district registries **now have facilities to deal with interim applications by telephone conferencing**.

> [!guid] General rule
> At a telephone enabled court all allocation hearings, listing hearings, interim applications, case management conferences and pre-trial reviews with a time estimate of less than an hour will be conducted by telephone

Exceptions:

- applications made with no notice to other party
- where all parties are unrepresented
- where more than 4 parties wish to make representations at hearing
- if application is being heard by telephone then no party/party’s legal representative can attend the judge in person
	- unless every other party has agreed

PD 23A, paras 6.9 and 6.10: mechanics of telephone conference hearing

> [!action]
> Applicant’s legal representative must file and serve case summary and draft order no later than 4pm 2 days before the telephone hearing if the claim has been allocated to multi-track or if the court directs.

### Preparing Supporting Evidence

General questions about witness statement:

1. Why should make statement?
2. What should be included?
3. How should the statement appear?
4. What about hearsay?

Don't include points of law.

### Public/ Private Hearings

See r 39.2 CPR for guidance.

- Generally, hearings are public, except if the court decides it should be private.
- Court will bear in mind freedom of expression considerations.
- When deciding on private, court considers factors including:
	- If publicity would defeat the object
	- National security
	- Confidential information (e.g., personal financial information)
	- Child/ protected party

## Interim Costs

### Costs of Applying

Any interim court application costs money. The judge may decide that one party should pay the other's costs–'pay as you go litigation'.

The normal order is that an applicant pays the respondent's costs of application, including additional costs. Expressed as 'costs of and caused by'.

### Possible Orders

For named party A, unnamed party B:

| Term                                        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A's costs/ A's costs in any event           | A entitled to costs wrt part of proceedings to which the order relates. Summarily assessed and ordered to pay within 14 days.                                                                                                                      |
| Costs in the case/ costs in the application | No party is named, no party is able to recover costs of interim hearing. Outcome will determine costs.                                                                                                                                             |
| A's costs in case                           | If A awarded costs at the end of proceedings, they are entitled to their costs of the part of proceedings to which the order relates. B is never entitled to recover the interim costs. A recovers interim costs only if awarded costs at the end. |
| A's costs thrown away                       | Where a judgment/ order against B set aside, B entitled to costs incurred and A cannot recover.                                                                                                                                                    |
| A's costs of and caused by                  | Court makes order on an application, A gets costs and any consequential costs                                                                                                                                                                      |
| No order as to costs                        | Each party bears their own costs, whichever way the judgment goes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

See [Costs orders commonly made: checklist, Practical Law](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/Idfa75d80e25211e398db8b09b4f043e0/View/FullText.html?navigationPath=Search%2Fv1%2Fresults%2Fnavigation%2Fi0ad7401100000182351e1646a78eccc7%3Fppcid%3Dc0a980e2f5064b068470b2d9a1d8da35%26Nav%3DKNOWHOW_UK%26fragmentIdentifier%3DIdfa75d80e25211e398db8b09b4f043e0%26parentRank%3D0%26startIndex%3D1%26contextData%3D%2528sc.Search%2529%26transitionType%3DSearchItem&listSource=Search&listPageSource=44bcbc1c4ad1b703331d2ac9478bb7c7&list=KNOWHOW_UK&rank=4&sessionScopeId=41ee73cb61e521307cbc865612f79b4a57e9843873b7cea25b7a1d4abfd584fc&ppcid=c0a980e2f5064b068470b2d9a1d8da35&originationContext=Search%20Result&transitionType=SearchItem&contextData=(sc.Search)&comp=pluk).

If there is no mention of costs, the general rule is that none are payable in respect of that application.

### Summary Assessment

If costs are ordered in favour of one of the parties, the court will make a summary assessment of costs on the spot, payable within 14 days unless otherwise specified.

Parties are required, $\geq 24$ hours prior to hearing, to file and serve a statement of costs, providing a breakdown of costs.

Model form of the statement of costs (Form N260).

## Fixed Costs

The court may award fixed costs rather than making an order. Part 45 sets out the occasions on which fixed costs may be granted and specifies the amount awarded to the receiving party.

### Cost-capping Order (r 3.19)

If one or more parties does not follow relevant pre-action protocol, unnecessary costs may be incurred. Court may make an order capping the amount of costs recoverable by a party incurred after that date.

| Costs capping | Costs management order |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Caps costs, made in exceptional circumstances.     | Does not limit the costs recoverable unless varied.                        |

Most reported applications of costs capping have failed. There is specific provision for costs  
capping orders in judicial review proceedings. Governed by s 88 Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015. Provisions apply where the application for leave to bring judicial review proceedings has been granted. Test set out in s 88(6).

> [!statute] s 88(6) Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015
> The court may make a costs capping order only if it is satisfied that—
> - (a) the proceedings are public interest proceedings,
> - (b) in the absence of the order, the applicant for judicial review would withdraw the application for judicial review or cease to participate in the proceedings, and
> - (c) it would be reasonable for the applicant for judicial review to do so.

### Making an Application

Normally it is D seeking to cap what V recovers in costs. Make claim as soon as possible.

- Evidence should set out whether the costs-capping order applies to whole litigation/ some part.
- Accompany with budget, setting out costs and disbursements.
- Court will direct that other parties file a similar budget.

### Grounds for Making Order

> [!statute] r 3.19(5)
> The court may at any stage of proceedings make a costs capping order against all or any of the parties, if –
> 
> (a) it is in the interests of justice to do so;
> 
> (b) there is a substantial risk that without such an order costs will be disproportionately incurred; and
> 
> (c) it is not satisfied that the risk in subparagraph (b) can be adequately controlled by –
> - (i) case management directions or orders made under this Part; and
> - (ii) detailed assessment of costs.

> [!statute] r 3.19(6)
> In considering whether to exercise its discretion under this rule, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, including –
> - (a) whether there is a substantial imbalance between the financial position of the parties;
> - (b) whether the costs of determining the amount of the cap are likely to be proportionate to the overall costs of the litigation;
> - (c) the stage which the proceedings have reached; and
> - (d) the costs which have been incurred to date and the future costs.

### Effect of Order

A costs-capping order, once made, limits the costs recoverable by the party subject to the order unless that party successfully applies to vary it. Variation will only be made if there is a material and substantial change in circumstances/ some other compelling reason.

### Conditional Fee Agreements

Does not prevent costs of interim application from being summarily assessed if the court has awarded costs in favour of a party.

#### Receiving Party CFA-funded

The court **cannot** order payment unless satisfied that the receiving party is immediately liable to their solicitor for the costs of the application under the CFA terms. Summary assessment can only deal with base costs.

#### Paying Party CFA-funded

Party may not be in a position to pay interim costs if ordered to do so Court may decide to defer payment of the interim costs until the end of proceedings.

## Appeals Against Interim Orders

Set out in Part 52 CPR.

### Courts

County Court:

```mermaid
graph LR
id1(District judge) --> id2(Circuit judge)
```

High Court:

```mermaid
graph LR

id1(Master/ district judge) --> id2(High Court judge)
```

### Factors

Permission will be granted if:

- Appeal has a real prospect of success, or
- Some other compelling reason for the appeal to be heard (r 52.3(6)).

Seek permission at original hearing/ from Appeal Court within 21 days of decision (either at the first instance, or if permission at the original hearing is refused).

### Appealing

Appeal hearing limited to a review of original decision. No new evidence admitted unless court orders otherwise (r 52.11). The appeal will be allowed if the original decision was wrong/ unjust.

## Set Aside Default Judgment (part 13)

### Mandatory Grounds

Under r 13.2, the court is obliged to set aside a default judgment that was wrongly entered  
before the defendant’s deadline for filing an acknowledgement of service or a defence (whichever is applicable) expired. The court is also obliged to set aside a default judgment  
entered after the claim was paid in full.

### Discretionary Grounds

> [!statute] r 13.3(1)
> (1) In any other case, the court may set aside or vary a judgment entered under Part 12 if—
> - (a) the defendant has a real prospect of successfully defending the claim; or
> - (b) it appears to the court that there is some other good reason why—
> 	- (i) the judgment should be set aside or varied; or
> 	- (ii) the defendant should be allowed to defend the claim.
> 
> (2) In considering whether to set aside or vary a judgment entered under Part 12, the matters to which the court must have regard include whether the person seeking to set aside the judgment made an application to do so promptly.

- The court will take account of the promptness of the defendant’s application to set aside
- The overriding objective expressly recognises the importance of ensuring that cases are dealt with expeditiously and fairly.

The application to the court must be on notice and must be supported by evidence. Although  
the rule states that only one of the grounds needs to be satisfied, in practice the defendant will  
usually have to show a defence with a real prospect of success at trial in order to persuade the  
court to exercise its discretion.

If the court accepts that there is a good reason for setting aside, as neither party can be said to be at fault in those circumstances, it is likely that the court will set aside the default judgment and make an order for costs in the case.

### Possible Orders

The court may:

- Set aside default judgment
- Refuse application, or
- Make a conditional order.
	- The normal condition is that the defendant pays into court the amount of the claim or such amount as they can reasonably afford.

### Costs

| Grounds                                   | Who pays costs                                                                                 |
 | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Mandatory grounds                         | Claimant at fault for entering judgment at the wrong time, so usually ordered to pay D's costs |
 | Discretionary grounds                     | Neither side at fault, more likely D pays depending on particulars                             |
 | Conditional order due to late application | D pays for being at fault.                                                                                                |

![[costs-application.png]]

## Summary Judgment (Part 24)

Aim: to enable C/D to obtain judgment at an early stage without the time and expense of a full trial.

> [!warning]
> Summary judgment is not the same as default judgment.

### Grounds

> [!statute] CPR 24.2
> The court may give summary judgment against a claimant or defendant on the whole of a claim or on a particular issue if –
> - (a) it considers that –
> 	- (i) that claimant has **no real prospect of succeeding** on the claim or issue; or
> 	- (ii) that defendant has **no real prospect of successfully defending** the claim or issue; and
> - (b) there is **no other compelling reason** why the case or issue should be disposed of at a trial.

(Rule 3.4 makes provision for the court to strike out a statement of case or part of a statement of case if it appears that it discloses no reasonable grounds for bringing or defending a claim).

Either party can apply for summary judgment, or the court can schedule a hearing on its own initiative.

#### No Real Prospect of Success

The court must scrutinise how the parties have stated their respective cases and examine the essence of the way in which the case or issue is put at the hearing, but no more than that ([[Barks v Instant Access Properties Ltd (In Liquidation) [2013] EWHC 114]]).

To defeat an application for summary judgment, the respondent must have a case which has a “real, as opposed to a fanciful, chance of winning” ([[Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91]]).

> [!statute] PD 24 para 1.3
> An application for summary judgment under rule 24.2 may be based on:
> 1. a point of law (including a question of construction of a document),
> 2. the evidence which can reasonably be expected to be available at trial or the lack of it, or
> 3. a combination of these.

#### No Other Compelling Reason

Compelling reasons include:

- Need to investigate ([[Celador Productions Limited v Melville [2004] EWHC 2362 (Ch)]])
- Where one party holds all of the factual cards ([[Harrison v Bottenheim (1878) 26 WR 362]])
- Questionable conduct by the applicant ([[Miles v Bull [1969] 1 QB 258]])
- The case is particularly complex ([[Three Rivers DC v Bank of England (No 3) [2001] UKHL 16]])
- The case is on a novel point of law for which there is little authority ([[Swain v Hillman [2001] 1 All ER 91]])

### Procedure

- C **may not** apply for summary judgment **until D has filed an acknowledgement of service or a defence**, unless the court gives permission.
	- If D fails to file acknowledgement of service/ defence, C can enter default judgment without having to make an application for summary judgment.
	- If C files for summary judgment before D files a defence, D need not file a defence until the application has been heard.
- D **may** apply for summary judgment **at any time**.
- Application should be made without delay, usually before filing of direction questionnaires.
- Application notice and evidence should be served on the opponent $\geq 14$ days' before the hearing, unless varied by a practice direction or the court (CPR 24.4(3)).
	- The application notice should
		- State that it is an application for summary judgment
		- Identify concisely any point of law/ provision on which the applicant relies (PD 24 para 2(3))
		- State that it is made because the applicant believes on the evidence that the respondent has no real prospect of succeeding/ successfully defending (PD 24 para 2(3))
		- Inform the other party of their right to file and serve written evidence in reply.
- Respondent should file and serve evidence $\geq 7$ days before the hearing (CPR 24.5(1))
- If the applicant wishes to respond to the respondent's evidence, he should do so $\geq 3$ days before the hearing (CPR 24.5(2)).

### Orders a Court May Make

> [!statute] PD 24 para 5.1
> The orders the court may make on an application under Part 24 include:
> 1. judgment on the claim,
> 2. the striking out or dismissal of the claim,
> 3. the dismissal of the application,
> 4. a conditional order.

> [!important]
> The claims only go one way. So if C is the applicant, the only possible orders which the court can make are:
> 1. Granting summary judgment
> 2. Dismissing the application and allowing the case to proceed to trial.
> 
> If D, in addition to opposing the application for summary judgment, wants to apply for an order striking out the (OG) claim, D must make their own application for summary judgment. 

If there are credible witnesses both saying opposite things and there is no conclusive circumstantial evidence, the application will be dismissed ([[Hussain v Woods and Another [2001] Lloyd's Rep PN 134]]).

> [!statute] PD 24 para 5.2
> A conditional order is an order which requires a party:
> 1. to pay a sum of money into court, or
> 2. to take a specified step in relation to his claim or defence, as the case may be, and provides that that party’s claim will be dismissed or his statement of case will be struck out if he does not comply.

A conditional order will be granted where it is likely but improbable that a claim/ defence will succeed – where a statement of case is “shadowy and unsatisfactory” ([[Bates v Microstar Ltd]]) or where D has a weak claim and has behaved dishonestly ([[Kooh Veisin Trading Co v Parsai]]).

If the claim might possibly succeed but is unlikely to do so, C will have to pay 75-80% of costs D could reasonably expect to recover if the claim was fully contested ([[Sweetman v Shepherd]]).

### Costs

- Where C is successful in obtaining summary judgment
	- The court will award fixed costs in straightforward cases.
		- £175 if judgment $£25 < P \leq £5,000$
		- £210 if judgment $P > £5,000$
	- Open to C to ask for costs to be summarily assessed.  
		- Court will award C costs of making application (claimant's costs)
		- Fix a date to assess quantum and deal with the costs of the claim (disposal hearing)
- Where D secures summary judgment (claim struck out)
	- D awarded costs of claim (including pre-action), subject to summary assessment.
- Conditional order
	- Costs in the case.

## Interim Payments Orders

> [!defn]
> An interim payment is an advance payment on account of any damages, debt or other sum (excluding costs) which a defendant may be held liable to pay.

This gives a claimant with a strong case some money before the case has concluded, to avoid financial hardship. Before applying, the claimant should try to negotiate with D/ D's insurance to obtain a voluntary interim payment.

Cannot be made before the time for acknowledging service has expired.

### Procedure

Application must be supported by evidence and served $\geq 14$ days before hearing date. Evidence required includes (PD 25B para 2.1):

- Amount of interim payment sought
- Items or matters wrt which interim payment sought
- Likely amount of final judgment
- Reasons for application.

**Respondent's** evidence must be served $\geq 7$ days before hearing date. **Applicant's** evidence in response should be served $\geq 3$ days before hearing.

### Grounds

> [!statute] r 25.7(1) CPR 1998
> The court may only make an order for an interim payment where any of the following conditions are satisfied –
> 
> (a) the defendant against whom the order is sought has admitted liability to pay damages or some other sum of money to the claimant;
> 
> (b) the claimant has obtained judgment against that defendant for damages to be assessed or for a sum of money (other than costs) to be assessed;
> 
> (c) it is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against the defendant from whom he is seeking an order for an interim payment whether or not that defendant is the only defendant or one of a number of defendants to the claim;
> 
> (d) the following conditions are satisfied –
> - (i) the claimant is seeking an order for possession of land (whether or not any other order is also sought); and
> - (ii) the court is satisfied that, if the case went to trial, the defendant would be held liable (even if the claim for possession fails) to pay the claimant a sum of money for the defendant’s occupation and use of the land while the claim for possession was pending; or
> 
> (e) in a claim in which there are two or more defendants and the order is sought against any one or more of those defendants, the following conditions are satisfied –
> 
> - (i) the court is satisfied that, if the claim went to trial, the claimant would obtain judgment for a substantial amount of money (other than costs) against at least one of the defendants (but the court cannot determine which); and
> 
> - (ii) all the defendants are either –
> 
> 	- (a) a defendant that is insured in respect of the claim;
> 	
> 	- (b) a defendant whose liability will be met by an insurer under section 151 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 or an insurer acting under the Motor Insurers Bureau Agreement, or the Motor Insurers Bureau where it is acting itself; or
> 	
> 	- (c) a defendant that is a public body.

No obligation on applicant to show their need for interim payment, though this would help persuade the court if the delay in assessing damages is unlikely to be substantial.

#### Financial Position

If the respondent wants the court to take into account their financial situation, they should disclose this in their evidence in reply to the application.

#### Standard of Proof

The applicant must prove the grounds of application relied upon up to the civil standard on the balance of probabilities, though in practice this is interpreted as the court being convinced that the applicant **will** succeed, not just it being likely ([[British and Commonwealth Holdings plc v Quadrex Holdings Inc [1989] 3 WLR 723]]).

#### Summary Judgment

Applications for interim payments and summary judgments often combined.

If the applicant can establish an entitlement to an interim payment, the court then has a  
discretion as to:

1. Whether to make an application, and
	- May be inappropriate if issues are complicated.
	- Inappropriate if significant causation issues remain.
2. If so, the amount.
	- The court must not make an interim payment of more than a 'reasonable proportion of the likely amount of the final judgment'
	- Take into account [[Contributory negligence]] and any counter-claim.

### Consequences of Interim Payment Order

If D has made an interim payment that exceeds their total liability under the final judgment, the court will invariably order repayment of the excess ([[Wakefield v NJS [2021] EWHC 3452 (QB)]]) and may award interest on the overpaid amount from the date of the interim payment.

## Security for Costs

> [!statute] r 25.12 - Security for Costs
> 
> (1) A defendant to any claim may apply under this Section of this Part for security for his costs of the proceedings.
> 
> (Part 3 provides for the court to order payment of sums into court in other circumstances. Rule 20.3 provides for this Section of this Part to apply to Part 20 claims)
> 
> (2) An application for security for costs must be supported by written evidence.
> 
> (3) Where the court makes an order for security for costs, it will –
> - (a) determine the amount of security; and
> - (b) direct –
> 	- (i) the manner in which; and
> 	- (ii) the time within which
> 
> the security must be given.

> [!statute] r 25.13 - Conditions to be satisfied
> (1) The court may make an order for security for costs under rule 25.12 if –
> - (a) it is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that it is just to make such an order; and
> - (b)
> 	- (i) one or more of the conditions in paragraph (2) applies, or
> 	- (ii) an enactment permits the court to require security for costs.
> 
> (2) The conditions are –
> - (a) the claimant is –
> 	- (i) resident out of the jurisdiction; but
> 	- (ii) not resident in a State bound by the 2005 Hague Convention, as defined in section 1(3) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 7;
> - (c) the claimant is a company or other body (whether incorporated inside or outside Great Britain) and there is reason to believe that it will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if ordered to do so;
> - (d) the claimant has changed his address since the claim was commenced with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation;
> - (e) the claimant failed to give his address in the claim form, or gave an incorrect address in that form;
> - (f) the claimant is acting as a nominal claimant, other than as a representative claimant under Part 19, and there is reason to believe that he will be unable to pay the defendant’s costs if ordered to do so;
> - (g) the claimant has taken steps in relation to his assets that would make it difficult to enforce an order for costs against him.
> 
> (Rule 3.4 allows the court to strike out a statement of case and Part 24 for it to give summary judgment)

### Purpose

Allows for a redistribution of costs, which can rack up very quickly. Better than being in a position where D has spent all their money on legal costs and does not have the funds to pay the final ordered damages.  

r 25.12(1): D may apply for security for their costs of the proceedings (note this includes a claimant defending a counterclaim).

### Discretionary Power

r 25.13(1): the court may make an order for security for costs if:

1. Considering all the circumstances, making such an order is just, and
2. At least one of Part 25 conditions are met (set out in rr 25.13 & 25.14). These include:
	1. Claimant resident outside of a 2005 Hague Convention State
		- Resident means where an individual claimant usually lives
			- Construed according to its ordinary and natural meaning
			- Includes, e.g., full-time education ([[R v Barnet LBC Ex p. Shah (Nilish) [1983] 2 A.C. 309]])
		- For a company, where the company's central management is located.
		- Where some claimants are resident out of the jurisdiction, but others are not, the court has jurisdiction to order security for costs based on all the circumstances of the case.
	2. Claimant in an impecunious company unlikely to be able to pay D's costs
		- D will produce evidence of poor credit ratings etc.
		- Court can make presumptions against a company which does not disclose its assets where there is no publicly available data.
		- D does not have to show on a balance of probabilities that claimant company will be unable to pay, but does need to give the court reason to believe company will be unable to pay ([[Jirehouse Capital v Beller [2008] EWCA Civ 908; [2009] 1 W.L.R. 751 ]])
		- Note, this is 'will be unable', rather than 'might be unable' ([[Re Unisoft Group (No.2) [1993] B.C.L.C. 532]])
		- A liquidator or receiver bringing proceedings in the name of an insolvent company is not under any duty to ensure that the company has sufficient funds to pay any costs awarded to the defendant.
	3. Claimant has taken steps to make enforcement difficult
		- See [[Ackerman v Ackerman [2012] 3 Costs LO 303]]
		- Objective test: what steps have the claimant taken in relation to their assets
		- No time limit for when steps were taken; could be before the commencement of proceedings.
		- But motive/ intention/ time of taking steps all relevant factors.
	4. Statutory provisions
		- s 70(6) of the Arbitration Act 1996 enables the court to grant security in relation to various applications to challenge an arbitration award or appeal on a point of law.

### Relevant Factors

1. Strength of claim and defence.
	- Any open admission or offer of settlement and any Part 36 offer made by the defendant will tend to undermine the application.
	- The true strength of each party’s case may not be easy to assess, and a detailed consideration of the merits is discouraged.
	- Merits of the case only relevant where it can be demonstrated that the party relying on merits could show a very high probability that the party would succeed ([[Porzelack KG v Porzelack (UK) Ltd [1987] 1 W.L.R. 420]])
2. Claimant's ability to provide security.
	- The court must strike a balance between the right of the claimant to pursue a genuine claim and the unfairness to the defendant of allowing the claimant to do so without providing security.
	- If the effect of an order for security would be to prevent the respondent to application from continuing its claim, then security should not be ordered.
		- Making an order which the claimant cannot meet could breach their right to a fair trial (Art 6(1) ECHR).
		- Burden of proving that an order for security will **stifle** the claim lies on the claimant on a balance of probabilities ([[Al-Koronky v Time Life Entertainment Group Ltd [2005] EWHC 1688 (QB)]])
	- Cost of providing securities of different types is relevant.
	- D unlikely to be able to persuade the court to order security where the claimant is funding litigation by a CFA.
3. Causes of impecuniosity
	- V may be able to persuade the court that shortage of money is caused by D's behaviour.
4. Property within jurisdiction
	- If C has substantial property of a permanent or fixed nature within the jurisdiction, unlikely that a security will be granted, since the property should be adequate security.
	- The court will not infer the existence of a real risk that assets within this country will be dissipated or shipped abroad to avoid their being available to satisfy a judgment for costs unless there is reason to question the probity of the claimant.
5. Timing of application
	- As soon as practicable.
	- Allowing a very late claim for security of costs could be disproportionate under Art 6 ECHR.
6. Counter-claim
	- The court may refuse to order security for costs in respect of a claim where the same issues arise on a counterclaim in the same proceedings ([_BJ Crabtree (Insulation) Ltd v GPT Communications Systems (1990) 59 B.L.R. 43, CA_](https://uk.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&serNum=1993253243&pubNum=4667&originatingDoc=I32D50AF055AF11E797D3B1B628A5D84C&refType=UC&originationContext=document&transitionType=CommentaryUKLink&ppcid=8dad670bb95640e991013ba44df97305&contextData=(sc.Category))).
	- Undesirability of one-sided litigation.
	- Where a claim and counterclaim both have independent vitality and each side can establish grounds for security against the other, the court will normally make orders for security against both sides or neither side.

### Procedure

- Make application for security as soon as facts justifying application are apparent
- For other applications, applicant encouraged to indicate they intend to apply on directions questionnaire.
- D should write to claimant and ask for voluntary security, before going ahead with a court order.
- Application must be supported by written evidence.
- D usually applies in relation to costs already incurred and estimated future costs.

### Form and Effect of Order

Order will specify:

- Amount of security
- Date by which claimant must provide it
- Form it must take.
	- Most commonly, C required to make a payment into court.
	- Security held by D's solicitor
	- Banker's draft or guarantee.
	- Charge over C's property ([[Xhosa Office Rentals Ltd v Multi High Tec PCB Ltd]])
	- Suitable undertaking to the court.

> [!question] What if C fails to provide the security by the date ordered?
> No CPR rule, but court will usually order that the claim is struck out and D entitled to apply for judgment to be entered and costs assessed. 

### Security Under R 3.1(5)

The court has the **discretionary power** under r 3.1(5) to order a party to **make a payment into court** if that party has, without good reason, failed to comply with a rule, Practice Direction or pre-action protocol.

The court will have regard to:

- Amount in dispute
- Costs the parties have incurred or may incur in future (r 3.1(6))
- Ability of the party to apply for relief under r 3.

Such orders are rare, and tends to be in cases of repeated breaches/ bad faith.
