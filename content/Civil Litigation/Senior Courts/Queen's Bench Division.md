# Queen's Bench Division

Predominantly civil court, with some criminal jurisdiction (through the [[Administrative Court]]). Mostly deals with contract disputes and tort claims (e.g., defamation, trespass, [[negligence]], nuisance). Deals with professional negligence.

QBD judges also preside over more specialist matters, such as applications for judicial review. High Court Judges also hear criminal cases in the Crown Court, including in its various regional centres.
