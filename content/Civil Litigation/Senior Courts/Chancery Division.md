# Chancery Division

Based in the Rolls Building in London and in eight principal regional trial centres, the Chancery Division is now the largest unit for handling business and property cases in the country.

The head of the Chancery Division is the Chancellor of the High Court. There are currently 18 High Court judges attached to the Division. In addition, in London, there are six judges who are referred to as Masters (one of whom is the Chief Master), and six Insolvency and Companies Court Judges (one of whom is the Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge). There are also a number of Specialist Circuit Judges and District Judges who sit outside London and (in the case of the Circuit Judges) occasionally in London.

The Chancery Division incorporates the Insolvency and Companies Court, the Patents Court and the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court (IPEC).

The remainder of the work of the Division is referred to as 'general Chancery' work. This is the area of practice where the law of equity is most significant.
