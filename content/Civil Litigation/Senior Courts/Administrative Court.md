# Administrative Court

- Part of the Queen's Bench Division
- Responsible for the administrative law jurisdiction of England and Wales.
- Work directed at lawfulness of actions of central and local Govt, regulatory and disciplinary bodies, inferior courts and tribunals, and other public bodies, and officials exercising public functions.
- Civil and criminal jurisdiction (notably appeals 'by way of case stated' from the [[Magistrates' Court]]).
- Not all judicial review proceedings are dealt with by the Administrative Court:
	- Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber), 'UTIAC', has JR powers in relation to most immigration decisions
- Some cases in the Administrative Court will be heard by a Divisional Court â€“ a court consisting of two or more judges. Happens in criminal cases like tricky extraditions.
- Most of the 71 High Court judges assigned to the Queen's Bench Division regularly sit in the Administrative Court, as do some judges in the Chancery and Family Division.
