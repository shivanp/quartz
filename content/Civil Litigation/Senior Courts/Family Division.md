# Family Division

Judges who sit in the High Court can hear all cases relating to children and have an exclusive jurisdiction in wardship â€“ a type of court order which gives custody of a minor (under 18) child to the court, with day-to-day care carried out by an individual(s) or local authority.

Judges in the High Court also hear appeals from the Family Court, which is the main court of first instance for both public and private family matters (at an equivalent level to the county courts). Briefly, public family law concerns the safety and protection of children and related issues, and private family law concerns divorce and ancillary financial arrangements.
