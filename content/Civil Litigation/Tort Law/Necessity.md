# Necessity

>Applicable where the defendant acted to save life, limb, or property.

N.B. not actually on the BPP syllabus.

Rare for defendant to rely on this defence and unclear whether it applies to negligence.

Defendant must prove:

1. They were acting in an emergency to prevent harm to claimant, third party and/ or defendant themselves
	- Subjective test: what the defendant believed at the time of the negligence
	- e.g. [[North v TNT Express (UK) Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 853]]
2. Were not at fault in causing the emergency
	- Defendant cannot rely on this defence if emergency arose out of defendant's negligence.
	- Defendant must show they acted reasonably, and necessity to act arose without their negligence
	- e.g. [[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Southport Corp [1956] A.C. 218]]

Note necessity is a complete defence.
