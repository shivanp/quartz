# Liability for omissions

## General Rule

Law of tort only imposes liability on those who cause injury or damage to another. No such duty is imposed on a mere failure to act (an 'omission'): established with [[Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987] AC 241]].

There are exceptions. Some obvious (a solicitor agreeing with client to issue proceedings at court by a certain date and then not). Others are more subtle/ need to be developed as not covered by precedent. Consider particularly [[proximity]] between parties, especially when considering exceptions.

Lord Hoffman, in [[Stovin v Wise [1996] A.C. 923]], laid out the principles behind the distinction between acts and omissions:

> There are sound reasons why omissions require different treatment from positive conduct. It is one thing for the law to say that a person who undertakes some activity shall take reasonable care not to cause damage to others. It is another thing for the law to require that a person who is doing nothing in particular shall take steps to prevent another from suffering harm from the acts of third parties or natural causes.

So in [[East Suffolk Rivers Catchment Board v Kent [1941] A.C. 74]], the catchment board's negligence in failing to repair a sea wall sooner than it did, did not make them subject to a duty to the defendant, whose field had remained flooded longer than it otherwise would have done. The damage had been caused by the flooding, which was not the board's fault.

## Exceptions

1. Where there is a statutory duty (e.g. [[Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957]] - occupier must ensure premises safe, [Section 4 Defective Premises Act 1972](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I153F0C90E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=78f54be21ac941bfac975587e4d18d32&contextData=(sc.Search)) imposes a duty on landlords to take reasonable care to see that persons who might reasonably be expected to be affected by defects to the premises are reasonably safe from personal injury or damage to their property.).
2. Where there is a contractual duty ([[Stansbie v Troman [1948] 2 KB 48]])
3. Where defendant has sufficient control over claimant (e.g. parent saving drowning child, or [[Reeves v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [1999] 3 All ER 897]])
4. Where defendant assumes responsibility for claimant - but note this is not construed widely ([[Barrett v Ministry of Defence [1995] 1 WLR 1217]])
5. Where defendant creates the risk, even if entirely without fault ([[Goldman v Hargrave [1967] 1 AC 645]])

Note: Often these exceptions overlap and it is a combination of factors, which influences the decision reached by the court.

If there is no precedent, the courts will consider whether a duty should be imposed by analogy with existing case law. The drawing of an analogy depends on identifying the legally significant features of the earlier authorities (the exceptions) – these significant features tend to be linked to foreseeability of harm, proximity and whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty (the ‘test’ from _Caparo v Dickman_). The exceptions to the general rule (i.e. circumstances in which the courts might impose a duty for an omission) can be discussed under ‘proximity’.

## Emergency Services

- Ambulance service owe a duty of care to respond to 999 call within reasonable time ([[Kent v Griffiths & Others [2000] 2 All ER 474]])
- The fire brigade owes **no** duty of care to attend a fire. But if they do attend a fire, owe a duty not to make the situation worse through a positive act ([[Capital and Counties plc v Hampshire County Council [1997] QB 1004]])
- Police owe **no** duty of care to respond to emergency calls ([[Alexandrou v Oxford [1993] 4 All ER 328]])
