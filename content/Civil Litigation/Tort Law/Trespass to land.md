# Trespass to land

Trespass is a fourth land-based tort also concerned with the protection of property rights.

It involves unlawful presence on somebody else's land. This interference must be intentional and direct, and an action of trespass to land is actionable per se (i.e., without proof of damage).

## Who Can Sue?

The claimant must have a legal interest in the land (possessionary or proprietary interest). In situations where a trespasser possesses demised land, the claimant would be the tenant or licensee in possession. The landowner would only have a right to sue in trespass to land where there would be damage to their interest beyond the terms of the licence/ lease.

Note, trespass to land is actionable *per se*. In cases where there is no actual damage, the harm compensated will be the unjustifiable interference with the claimant's land by the defendant.

## Elements

Two elements:

1. Direct and physical interference
2. Intention

### Direct and Physical Interference

Trespass to land is concerned with direct interference with the claimant's land. Land in this context includes anything under the land, built on the land, and the airspace above it.

Physical interference can be divided into 4 categories:

1. Entering the claimant's land
2. Remaining on the claimants land when permission has been revoked (e.g., tenant staying on after lease expiry)
3. Doing something that is not permitted on the claimant's land (entering a staff only area, damaging anything)
4. Placing objects on the claimant's land without permission (e.g., fly-tipping)

### Intention

The defendant must intend the direct action that results in the trespass, but need not intend to trespass.

e.g., voluntarily walking over a private field accidentally, or hitting a cricket ball into a neighbour's garden accidentally.

Key case: [[League Against Cruel Sports v Scott [1986] Q.B. 240]], an intention to trespass was implied.

## Defences

Three main defences to trespass to land:

1. Permission (consent)
2. Legal authority
3. Necessity

### Permission

Where the defendant has express or implied permission (or a licence) to enter or remain on the land. To be a valid defence, the defendant must not exceed the boundaries of their permission.

### Legal Authority

Under statute, the police have the authority to enter premises and carry out arrests. If they commit a wrongful act on the premises, then their original entry becomes a trespass (*trespass ad initio*).

### Necessity

Necessity applies where the trespass was necessary to protect a public/ private interest:

- [[Dewey v White [1827] 2 WLUK 115]]
- [[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Southport Corp [1956] A.C. 218]]

## Remedies

- Damages
- Injunctions
- Re-entry (a self-help remedy)
- Recovery of land (a court order for the defendant to be removed)
- Mesne profits (where defendants have made a profit or saved expenditure whilst wrongfully occupying the land)

Damages and/or injunctions are the primary remedies in trespass to land. Damages cover the costs of harm already suffered by the direct interference. Injunctions may be awarded where there is a continuing trespass or where a trespasser threatens to repeat the trespass, but for the latter, the trespass must be serious in nature.

The self-help remedy of re-entry might be available where the owner/occupier has been excluded from the land. Only reasonable force can be used to re-enter.

Alternatively, the owner/occupier can seek a court order for the defendant to be removed.

The claimant might bring an action for mesne profits to claim money from a defendant who wrongfully occupied the land and made a profit or saved expenditure in doing so, e.g., where a tenant fails to leave at the end of their tenancy and stops paying rent.

A claim in trespass to land must be brought within six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (s 2 [Limitation Act 1980](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/contents)).

## Examples of Trespass to Land

### Airspace

- [[Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co [1957] 2 Q.B. 334]]: advertising airspace trespass
- [[Laiqat v Majid [2005] EWHC 1305 (QB)]]: protruding extractor fan

Note that under s 76 [Civil Aviation Act 1982](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1982/16/contents), flying an aircraft at a reasonable height above someone’s property, does not constitute a trespass. In [[Lord Bernstein v Skyviews and General Ltd [1978] QB 479]], a claimant’s claim in trespass to land was rejected whereby the defendant used a light aircraft to take aerial photographs of the claimant’s property. The activity took place above the height as is necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of the claimant’s land and the structures upon it.

### Underground

- [[Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK Onshore Ltd [2010] UKSC 35]]

Following this case, the [Infrastructure Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/7/contents/enacted) has been passed. This allows oil, gas and geothermal companies an automatic right of access to land 300 m or lower for the purposes of exploiting petroleum or deep geothermal energy and the surface landowners are unable to object. The companies still have to obtain other permissions, such as planning and environmental permits.
