# Darby v National Trust [2001] EWCA Civ 189

There was an inconspicuous sign in a car park saying there should be no bathing in the pond. The car park was not next to the pond and there was a lot of other information on the sign. The court held that the defendant had not done enough to turn the claimant into a trespasser.

## Summary

N appealed against a decision that it had been negligent and in breach of the duty of care owed under the Occupiers Liability Act 1957 s.2 to D, who had drowned whilst swimming in a pond in the grounds of a stately home under the control of N.

It had been found that N had failed to prevent swimming or to erect adequate warning notices. N argued that it was under no duty to warn against the obvious danger of drowning. D submitted that bathers might have failed to appreciate the less obvious risk that a normally competent swimmer might experience difficulties in cold water.

The court held that  
(1) N had been under no duty to warn against swimming as the risk of drowning was obvious, and  
(2) the risks from Weils disease and drowning were fundamentally different. Accordingly, a breach of duty to protect against Weils disease could not support a claim for damages resulting from a different cause.

## Abstract

N appealed against a finding that it had been negligent and in breach of its duty of care owed under the [Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B605520E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=daed7749cf004dfcaa15f47052e7fff5&contextData=(sc.Default)) to KD, who had drowned whilst swimming in a pond in the grounds of a stately home under the control of N. It was found that N had failed to prevent visitors from swimming in the pond and had failed to erect adequate warning notices. N submitted that it was under no duty to warn against the obvious danger of swimming, given that the relevant pond was no more hazardous than any other.

D, the widow of KD, submitted that  
(1) the risk of drowning was reasonably foreseeable as the pond was often used by bathers. Further, that bathers might have failed to appreciate the less obvious risk that a normally competent swimmer might experience difficulties in cold water, and  
(2) given that evidence showed there was a danger of contracting Weils disease from swimming in the pond, had there been a notice warning of that danger D would not have swum in the pond.

Held, allowing the appeal, that  
(1) in the absence of a relative causative risk that was not obvious, there was no duty on the occupier of land to warn against an obvious danger, _[Staples v West Dorset DC 93 L.G.R. 536, [1995] 4 WLUK 58](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBE45EF50E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=daed7749cf004dfcaa15f47052e7fff5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. In the instant case, the risk of drowning was clearly obvious, and  
(2) the risk of contracting Weils disease and the risk of drowning were fundamentally different. A breach of duty to protect against Weils disease could not support a claim for damages attributable to a different cause, _[South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd [1997] A.C. 191, [1996] 6 WLUK 227](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB6F1DDE0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=daed7749cf004dfcaa15f47052e7fff5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. Since the risks were intrinsically different, so were any dependent duties.
