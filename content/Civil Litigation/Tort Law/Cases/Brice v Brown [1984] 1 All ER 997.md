# Brice v Brown [1984] 1 All ER 997

## Abstract

If nervous shock is a reasonably foreseeable result of a tortfeasor's breach of his duty of care, it makes no difference that the extent of the injury was unforeseeable. P, a woman aged 42, had suffered from a hysterical personality disorder since childhood. She was, however, able to lead a normal life with her husband and family, punctuated by bouts of depression, hysteria and illness. Due to D's negligence in driving, P's daughter suffered what seemed to be very serious injury. This had a severely detrimental effect on P's mental stability, leading to violent displays of temper, attempts at suicide and admission to hospital. Her condition subsequently stabilised to some extent, but remained severely abnormal, leaving her needing constant supervision. D contended that to be held liable for nervous shock, the extent of the shock must have been foreseeable.

Held, that if nervous shock was a reasonably foreseeable result of a tortfeasor's breach of his duty of care, it made no difference that the extent of the injury was unforeseeable, and P was entitled to damages for her condition (dicta of Lord Parker C.J. in _[Smith v Leech Brain & Co [1962] 2 Q.B. 405, [1961] 11 WLUK 63](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IAF33E710E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c09bd35afb63433b9e3d6565afef9654&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied and of Lord Wilberforce, Lord Russell and Lord Bridge in _[McLoughlin v O'Brian [1983] 1 A.C. 410, [1982] 5 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7E61740E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c09bd35afb63433b9e3d6565afef9654&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Bourhill v Young [1943] A.C. 92, [1942] 8 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I77000B40E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c09bd35afb63433b9e3d6565afef9654&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished).
