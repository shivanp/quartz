# Haley v London Electricity Board [1965] AC 778

## Facts

Some workmen were digging a trench in a pavement. They went off to lunch. They had nothing to fence of the trench so they left a shovel and pick at one end and a punner at the other end to warn pedestrians. The claimant, a blind man, tripped on the punner and fell hitting his head. As a result of the fall he became deaf. The defendant argued they had done all that was necessary to warn an ordinary person of the danger and there was no need to take extra precautions for blind persons as it was not foreseeable that a blind person would be walking unaided down that street.  

  

## Held

  

The defendant was in breach of duty. It was foreseeable that a blind person might walk down the street and they should be given appropriate protection.
