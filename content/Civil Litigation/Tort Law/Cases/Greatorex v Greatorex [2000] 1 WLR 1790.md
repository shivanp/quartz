# Greatorex v Greatorex [2000] 1 WLR 1790

The defendant injured himself in a road accident due to his own negligence. It was held that he did not owe a duty of care to the claimant fire officer (his father) who arrived at the scene and subsequently suffered psychiatric damage on seeing the injuries to his son.

---

## Facts

The defendant, John Greatorex (D), had been drinking with his friend H. With H’s permission, D proceeded to drive H’s car, with H himself as a passenger. D was responsible for a serious collision with an oncoming vehicle. H did not suffer any serious injuries, but D was left trapped inside the car, unconscious and with a severe head injury.

The emergency services were called and soon arrived on the scene. Amongst them was the claimant, Christopher Greatorex (C), a fire officer and the father of D. Having to attend to his son in such circumstances caused C to develop long-term post-traumatic stress disorder, and as a result C brought an action against D for negligence.

## Issues

The principal issue in this case was whether, and in what circumstances, a person could be liable in negligence to a close family member for any self-inflicted harm that, having been witnessed by said family member, had caused them to suffer lasting psychiatric damage.

## Decision/Outcome

The court, finding in favour of C, rejected the claim on policy grounds. Whilst it was correct that C fell within the definition of a ‘secondary victim’, meeting the criteria set out in _Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire_, a primary victim could not be liable in negligence to a family member as a result of their own self-inflicted injuries; no duty of care was owed in such circumstances, as to hold otherwise would place an inexcusable fetter on personal autonomy. Moreover, to permit litigation for purely psychiatric damage in such cases might exacerbate the underlying problem, for instance if the primary victim were themselves suffering from a psychiatric disorder, and “would be potentially productive of acute family strife.”
