# Taylor v Glasgow City Council [1922] 1 AC 44

 A child of seven died after eating poisonous berries from a bush on the defendant's premises. Liability was established â€” the defendant knew the berries were poisonous but took no action to warn children of the danger nor to prevent children from picking them. The court held that the bush was an allurement to children, and as such should have been fenced off. Of course, the standard of care would have been lower if the visitor had been an adult, as an adult should be aware of the dangers of red berries and as such the defendant would not have been in breach of duty.
