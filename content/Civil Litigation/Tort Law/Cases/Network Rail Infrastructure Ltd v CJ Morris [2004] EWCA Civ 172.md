# Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd v CJ Morris [2004] EWCA Civ 172

The claimant argued that a signalling system installed by the defendant (Network Rail), interfered with electric guitars being used in the claimantâ€™s recording studio. The defendant argued that the use of the studio was abnormally sensitive, in that the claimant was involved in an extraordinary commercial activity.

The court doubted whether the concept of abnormal sensitivity still existed and thought such cases should be viewed in terms of foreseeability instead. If something or someone is abnormally sensitive, then arguably the loss is not foreseeable to the defendant. An activity on land can only be a nuisance if the defendant could reasonably foresee that it might be a nuisance to someone else. It was recognised that the use of electronic equipment was now a feature of modern life, but it was not reasonable to expect the defendant to foresee the interference caused to the electric guitars. The defendant was not liable.
