# Bradford v Robinson Rentals [1967] 1 All ER 267

The defendant employer knew the fan heater in the claimantâ€™s van was not working which required the claimant to keep the window down on a 20-hour journey! The claimant suffered from frostbite. The defendant argued frostbite was not reasonably foreseeable (very rare in the UK).

**Held:** it was reasonably foreseeable that if the employer did not maintain their vehicles the employee could get some kind of **cold related injury** (ie the type of harm that had to be foreseeable was defined broadly). Frostbite fell within this type of injury.
