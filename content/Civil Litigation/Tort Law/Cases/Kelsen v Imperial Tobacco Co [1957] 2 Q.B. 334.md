# Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co [1957] 2 Q.B. 334

The claimant rented a shop, and sought an injunction requiring the defendant to remove an advertisement sign that projected eight inches into the airspace above his shop. The court held that the invasion of the airspace above the claimantâ€™s shop by the advertisement sign amounted to trespass to land as it was over the boundary line of the properties.
