# Ready Mixed Concrete v Minister of Pensions [1968] 2 QB 497

#key-case

**FACTS:** the court had to consider the status of X who drove a lorry carrying a concrete mixer. X was responsible for hiring, insuring and running the lorry and was paid by the company on the basis of his mileage. He had no set hours, no instructions on routes or set breaks and was defined in the contract as an independent contractor. However, the company exercised control over uniform and colours of the lorry (he could not use the lorry for another business).

**HELD:** The driver was an independent contractor. The driver was in business on his own account: 'he who owns the assets and bears the risk is unlikely to be a servant' (i.e. unlikely to be an employee: some older cases use the language of 'master' and 'servant' instead of 'employer' and 'employee').
