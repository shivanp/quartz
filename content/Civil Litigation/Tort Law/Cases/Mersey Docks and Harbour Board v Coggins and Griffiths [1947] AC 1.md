# Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffiths [1947] AC 1

 In _Mersey Docks_ a crane driver (A) and his crane were hired to Y. Y could instruct him as to the work to be done on a day-to-day basis, but they did not tell him how to operate his crane. The House of Lords found that A was still the employee of X; X had authority to tell A the manner in which his work should be done (A was using X's crane), X paid A's wages, had the power to dismiss A and the duration of the post was temporary.
