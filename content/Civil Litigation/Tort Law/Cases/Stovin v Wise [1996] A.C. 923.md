# Stovin v Wise [1996] A.C. 923

## Abstract

N, in its capacity as highway authority, appealed from a finding that, in failing to propose the expeditious removal of a dangerous obstruction near a road it was in breach of a common law duty of care to road users. N had become aware of a visibility problem caused by a bank of land at a road junction where three accidents had previously occurred in the past 12 years. The matter had been discussed with the land owners, and it had been agreed that N would carry out the necessary work. However, no action had been taken to remove the obstruction by the date on which S was seriously injured as a result of a collision with a car driven by W, who joined N as second defendant to S's claim for damages.

Held, allowing the appeal, that under the [Highways Act 1980 s.79](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IEFE133F0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=150de8d897014439b388c4e97d7e4024&contextData=(sc.DocLink)) a highway authority had discretionary powers to require the removal of such obstructions. However, a statutory power did not give rise to a common law duty of care and N had not acted unreasonably in failing to proceed under that power. Even if the work ought to have been carried out, it could not be found that a public law duty gave rise to an obligation to compensate those suffering loss due to its nonperformance. The creation of a duty of care in the circumstances posed an unacceptable risk to local authority budgetary decision making in an area where road users themselves were subject to compulsory insurance requirements.
