# Stennett v Hancock [1939] 2 All ER 578

The owner of a motor lorry took the wheel of the lorry, the flange of which had come off, to a motor repairer, with instructions to reassemble it. The repairer’s assistants reassembled it and replaced it on the lorry, and the lorry owner’s servant drove the lorry away. An hour or two later, the flange came off while the lorry was being driven on the highway by the lorry owner’s servant, and, bowling along the road, it mounted the pavement and hit female plaintiff, injuring her. There was no evidence that anything had happened between the time when the lorry was taken out of the garage and the time of the accident which might have caused the wheel to become dislodged:
