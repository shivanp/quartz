# Cassidy v Ministry of Health [1951] 2 KB 343

## Facts

The claimant was a patient at a hospital run by the defendant who required routine treatment to set the bones in his wrist. Due to negligence on the part of one of the doctors, the operation caused his fingers to become stiff. The claimant sued the defendant in the tort of negligence on the basis of [[Vicarious liability]].

## Issue

If negligence is proven against a primary tortfeasor, it is sometimes possible to hold their employer liable under the doctrine of [[Vicarious liability]]. This doctrine holds that an employer is legally responsible for torts committed by their ‘servants’ in the course of their employment. The equivalent term under modern law would be ‘employee’. At the time, the dominant test for determining whether the primary tortfeasor was a servant was whether the defendant had control over how they performed their services.

The defendant argued that the doctor responsible for the negligence was not one of their servants, as they had no control over how he performed his job.

The issue was the meaning of ‘servant’ in the context of [[Vicarious liability]].

## Held

The [[Court of Appeal]] held that the defendant was vicariously liable.

The fact that the worker engages in specialised and technical work for which he is specially qualified does not mean that he is necessarily not a servant. The Court held that a person is a servant of the defendant if he was chosen for the job by the defendant and is fully integrated into the defendant’s organisation.

In this case, the doctors were appointed to the hospital by the defendant and not chosen by the patient, and were fully integrated into the hospital. They were therefore the defendant’s servants.

## Case Digest

The following principles emerge from the authorities as regards the liability of a hospital for negligence in the treatment of the patients in the hospital:

1. The principle of respondent superior is not ousted by the fact that a "servant" has to do work of a skilful or technical character, for which the servant has special qualifications.
2. When hospital authorities undertake to treat a patient and themselves select and appoint and employ the professional men and women who are to give the treatment, they are responsible for the negligence of those persons in failing to give proper treatment, no matter whether they are doctors, surgeons, nurses, or anyone else.
3. There is no reason why the hospital authorities should not also be responsible for the house surgeons and resident medical officers on their permanent staff.
4. If the patient is treated by someone who is a visiting or consulting surgeon or physician, he is being treated by someone who is not a servant of the hospital.
5. Nurses remain the servants of the hospital authorities even when they are under the direction of the surgeon in the operating theatre.
6. If the patient's injury is caused by the negligence on the part of anyone employed by the hospital authorities responsibility falls in the first instance on the hospital authorities and it is not necessary for the patient to pick on any particular employee and to prove that he was negligent in a case in which all those concerned were employees of the hospital authority.

Per Denning, L.J.:

> "It has been said … that the liability for doctors on the permanent staff depends on whether there is a contract of service, and that must depend on the facts of any particular case. I venture to take a different view. I think it depends on this: Who employs the doctor or surgeon? Is it the patient or the hospital authorities? If the patient himself selects and employs the doctor or surgeon, … the hospital authorities are, of course, not liable for his negligence, because he is not employed by them. Where, however, the doctor or surgeon, be he a consultant or not, is employed and paid, not by the patient, but by the hospital authorities, I am of opinion that the hospital authorities are liable for his negligence in treating the patient. It does not depend on whether the contract under which he was employed was a contract of service or a contract for services".

The plaintiff underwent an operation in respect of a contraction of his third and fourth fingers in a hospital taken over by the defendants under the [National Health Service Act 1946](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC4687D30F1DF11E38619EB509A93FC7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7129655490a445918b43ddbd89de0ce5&contextData=(sc.Default)). After the operation the plaintiff's hand was kept rigid in a splint for fourteen days, and on being released from the splint it was found to be practically useless by reason of too tight and too prolonged bandaging and immobilisation in the splint. The hand had been examined during those fourteen days by an assistant medical officer in the whole-time employment of the defendants, who was in receipt of a sum in lieu of residential emoluments. It had also been examined by a house surgeon working under him.

Held, the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of negligence against the defendants which had not been displaced; as those responsible for the post-operational treatment were all full-time employees of the defendants it was not necessary for the plaintiff to establish precisely which employee was negligent.
