# Cox v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10

Mrs Cox was the catering manager, injured when a prisoner who worked for her in the kitchens, negligently dropped a sack of rice onto her back as she was leaning forwards. It was accepted that the prisoner had been negligent.

The prisoner was paid a small amount of money, but in all other ways it was clear that he did not satisfy the requirements of an employment relationship nor was he carrying out an independent business. There was no contract, and the purpose of his work was for rehabilitation. The court focused on criteria (b) to (d) above and held that the defendant should be liable: the tortfeasor was carrying out an activity on behalf of the defendant that was integral to the defendant's business (feeding prisoners) and by doing so the defendant had created the risk of the tort being committed. It was therefore fair, just and reasonable to hold the defendant vicariously liable.
