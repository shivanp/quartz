# Andreae v Selfridge and Co Ltd [1938] Ch 1 (CA)

The defendant was undertaking extensive building work next to the claimant’s hotel, causing the claimant loss of custom due to noise and dust. The claimant was successful.

The court held that there will always be some disturbance when one party is undertaking building works next to another. Provided these works are reasonably carried on, and all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that no undue inconvenience is caused to the neighbours, whether from noise, dust or other reasons, the neighbours must put up with it. However, the defendant had not exercised reasonable care; its attitude was to work until someone complained, and its own convenience prevailed over the neighbours’ convenience.
