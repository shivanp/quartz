# Trevett v Lee [1955] I WLR 113

The defendant's house was not connected with a water main and in times of drought, the defendant would lay a garden hosepipe across the road to enable water to be brought by a water supply on the other side of the road to their premises. The claimant saw the pipe, but failed to step over it, caught her heel in it, fell and injured her back. The court held that there was no nuisance. However, if the court had found a nuisance, they confirmed that the defendant would have been able to argue the defence of contributory negligence. Note that this case concerned public nuisance, but the same principle applies to private nuisance.
