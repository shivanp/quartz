# Bowater v Rowley Regis Corporation [1944] KB 476

**Facts**:

The claimant, a carter, was an employee of the defendants and collected road sweepings for them. He was ordered to take out a horse which had run away on previous occasions before. Both, the employee and the employers were aware of the fact. Carter protested but eventually followed the order. Several weeks later, the horse ran away and the carter got injured as a result. Therefore, he brought an action against his employer for negligence and claimed damages.

**Issues**:

Could the defendants avid liability in negligence by relying upon the defence of volenti non fit injuria?

**Held**:

The Court of Appeal found for the claimant. The Court held that the corporation negligently breached their duty to provide safe horse for their employee. It was further found that the defence of volenti non fit injuria was not applicable to the case.

As per Goddard LJ:

>’in a case of master and servant the maxim “volenti non fit injuria” must be applied with extreme caution.

As per Scott LJ:

> ‘for the purpose of the rule, if it be a rule, a man cannot be said to be truly “willing” unless he is in a position to choose freely, and freedom of choice predicates, not only full knowledge of the circumstances on which the exercise of choice is conditioned, so that he may be able to choose wisely, but the absence from his mind of any feeling of constraint so that nothing shall interfere with the freedom of his will.’
