# Bocardo SA v Star Energy UK Onshore Ltd [2010] UKSC 35

#key-case

Part of an oilfield lay under the claimant’s land. The defendant had a licence from the Crown to obtain petrol from the oilfield on neighbouring land. Without acquiring a licence from the claimant, the defendant drilled wells under the claimant’s land at depths of between 800ft to 2,900ft. The claimant suffered no physical harm to their land nor any interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. The court considered how much of the substrata (land beneath the ground) was owned by the freeholder.

The Supreme Court held that the wells constituted a trespass. There had to be some stopping point, where one reached the point at which physical features such as pressure and temperature rendered the concept of the strata belonging to anybody absurd. But the wells in this case were far from being so deep as to reach the point of absurdity; the fact that the strata could be worked upon at the depths in question pointed to the opposite conclusion. The claimant was awarded £1,000 in damages.
