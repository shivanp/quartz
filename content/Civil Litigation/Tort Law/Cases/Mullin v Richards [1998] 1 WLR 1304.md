### Abstract

In February 1988 M and R, two 15 year old schoolgirls, were play fighting with plastic rulers during a class when one of the rulers snapped and a fragment of plastic entered M's right eye causing her to lose all sight in that eye. M commenced proceedings in negligence against R and the education authority.

The claim was dismissed against the education authority and upheld against R on the basis that she must have appreciated that what she was doing was dangerous, that she had used excessive violence and that it was readily foreseeable that her conduct might cause an eye injury to M. A 50 per cent reduction was made for contributory negligence. R appealed against the finding of negligence against her contending, inter alia, that there was not sufficient evidence for the finding that it was readily foreseeable that R's conduct might cause an injury of the type that M suffered.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the test of foreseeability in this context is whether an ordinarily prudent and reasonable 15 year old schoolgirl in R's situation would have realised that her actions gave rise to a risk of injury, McHale v Watson (1966) 115 C.L.R. 199, [1965] C.L.Y. 3987 followed, and _[Gough v Thorne [1966] 1 W.L.R. 1387, [1966] 6 WLUK 98](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB2DCC040E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b5efebb755214515a0bff244158f5095&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. A mere possibility of injury was not enough, _[Bolton v Stone [1951] A.C. 850, [1951] 5 WLUK 44](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7666FF90E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b5efebb755214515a0bff244158f5095&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.

The question of foreseeability must be judged against the evidential background concerning the prevalence of the practice of fencing with plastic rulers, the absence of prohibition, the absence of warning against it or of its dangers and the absence of any evidence of any previous injury. Further there was no evidence to support the judge's finding that M and R were guilty of using misdirected and dangerous force over and above that which was inherent in play fencing. Accordingly, the judge erred in finding negligence against R without there being material on which he could properly do so.
