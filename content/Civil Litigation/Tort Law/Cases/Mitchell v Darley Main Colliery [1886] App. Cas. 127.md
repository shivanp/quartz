# Mitchell v Darley Main Colliery [1886] App. Cas. 127

The owner of land whose land was affected by subsidence in 1868 and who received compensation from those who had worked coal and caused the subsidence, was able, in 1882 when further subsidence took place causing further injury, to bring a fresh action for compensation.

No action could be brought in respect of a withdrawal of support until physical damage had occurred. That was then a fresh action.

> ‘A man slandered or libelled by words actionable in themselves must sue, if at all, for all his damage in one action.’
>
> ‘No one will think of disputing the proposition that for one cause of action you must recover all damages incident to it by law once and for ever. A house that has received a shock may not at once show all the damage done to it, but it is damaged nonetheless [then] to the extent that it is damaged, and the fact that the damage only manifests itself later on by stages does not alter the fact that the damage is there; and so of the more complex mechanism of the human frame, the damage is done in a railway accident, the whole machinery is injured, though it may escape the eye or even the consciousness of the sufferer at the time, the later stages of suffering are but the manifestations of the [original] damage done, and consequent upon the injury originally sustained.’
