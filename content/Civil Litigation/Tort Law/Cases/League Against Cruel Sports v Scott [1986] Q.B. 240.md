# League Against Cruel Sports v Scott [1986] Q.B. 240

#key-case

The claimant owned unfenced areas of Exmoor on which there were wild deer sanctuaries. On seven occasions, over 1982 and 1983, hunting dogs (hounds) strayed onto the claimant’s land. There was no actual intention by the defendant to allow the dogs onto the claimant’s land.

The court held that there was an implied intention to trespass because the defendant knew that there was a real risk of the dogs entering the claimant’s land. By persistently hunting close to prohibited land (where hunting was not allowed) in circumstances where it was impossible to prevent trespass by the dogs, this amounted to an intention to trespass.
