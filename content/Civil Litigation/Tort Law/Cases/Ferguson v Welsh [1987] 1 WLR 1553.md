# Ferguson v Welsh [1987] 1 WLR 1553

A council contracted with Mr Spence to demolish a building. The contract contained a clause prohibiting subcontracting without the councilâ€™s consent. Without consent, Mr Spence subcontracted the work to the Welsh brothers. They, in turn, offered the claimant a job. Whilst carrying out the work, the claimant sustained serious injuries. He sued Mr Spence, the Welsh brothers and the council. The House of Lords held that the claimant was a lawful visitor in relation to Mr Spence but a trespasser in relation to the Council.
