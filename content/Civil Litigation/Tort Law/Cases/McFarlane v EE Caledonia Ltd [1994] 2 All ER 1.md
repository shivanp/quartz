# McFarlane v EE Caledonia Ltd [1994] 2 All ER 1

The Court of Appeal considered liability for psychiatric harm (PTSD) suffered by the claimant after an oil rig disaster (Piper Alpha). During the disaster, the claimant was aboard a rescue vessel which remained in the area, but at a safe distance, collecting other survivors. The court rejected the claimant's claim as a primary victim for psychiatric harm, because they did not feel that the claimant was in fact in reasonable fear for his physical safety at the time.

The Court of Appeal also rejected his claim as a rescuer, stating that recovery was limited to those actively involved in the rescue, not mere bystanders. He was thus treated as a secondary victim and failed to establish the more stringent _Alcock_ requirements, as discussed later.
