# Baker v T.E. Hopkins & Son Ltd [1959] 3 All ER 225

  

## Facts

Mr Ward and Mr Wileman were employed by the defendant, Hopkins. They had been called to clean out a well. The well was 50ft deep and 6ft wide. Hopkins tested the atmosphere in the well by putting a lighted candle down the well. The candle returned still lighted and thus he concluded the atmosphere was fine. He and Ward then took a petrol motored pump down the well started it up and left the well leaving the engine running on its own. The motor ran for 1 1/2 hours before it stopped of its own accord. Before leaving the site Mr Hopkins told Mr Ward and Mr Wileman not to go down the well until the fumes have cleared. The following morning Hopkins again told the two not to go down the well until he had arrived on the site. In breach of these orders Mr. Ward went down the well and was overcome by fumes. Mr Wileman called for assistance and went down the well after him. The claimant, Dr Baker, then arrived on the scene. He too went into the well to seek to rescue the two. Unfortunately all three died of carbon monoxide poisoning. The defendant contended that the act of the doctor acted as a _novus actus interveniens_ and sought to invoke _volenti non fit injuria_.  

  

## Held

  

The doctors actions were not a novus actus interveniens. It was foreseeable that if a defendant by his negligence places another in peril that someone may come to his rescue and the doctor's actions were not unreasonable in the circumstances. The Claimant's action was not defeated by _volenti non fit injuria_. He was and as such his actions did not count as freely and voluntarily accepting the risk.

Morris LJ:

> It was said that Dr. Baker had been "unreasonably" brave. If a rescuer acts with a wanton disregard of his own safety it might be that in some circumstances it might be held that any injury to him was not the result of the negligence that caused the situation of danger. Such a contention cannot be here asserted. Dr. Baker tied a strong rope round his body and arranged for the rope to be held by those on the surface, and arranged to maintain oral communication with them. It must be remembered also that the chances of success of his attempt would diminish moment by moment if he tarried. He in no way acted recklessly or negligently. In my judgment, the learned Judge came to a correct conclusion in regard to the claim made by his executors.

### Abstract

Per Morris L.J.:

> "If … A by negligence places B in peril in such circumstances that it is a foreseeable result that someone will try to rescue B and if C does so try - ought C in any appropriate sense to be described as a 'volunteer'? In my judgment the answer is No … C would not have agreed to run the risk that A might be negligent, for C would only play his part after A had been negligent. C's intervention comes at the moment when there is some situation of peril and the cause of or the responsibility for the creation of the peril may be quite unknown to C. If C, actuated by an impulsive desire to save life, acts bravely and promptly and subjugates any timorous over-concern for his own well-being or comfort, I cannot think that it would be either rational or seemly to say that he freely and voluntarily agreed to incur the risks of the situation which had been created by A's negligence."

The defendants were a firm of contractors who had been employed to clean out a well. H., the managing director of the firm, caused a petrol engine to be installed in the well, about 30 feet below the level of the ground. After the engine had been working for a few minutes H. realised that the fumes were dangerous. He warned his employees not to go down the well the following day until the fumes had cleared; and on the following day he repeated his warning. The employees, however, went down the well, and were overcome by the fumes. A doctor attempted to rescue the employees, but in so doing was himself overcome by the fumes. All three men died.

Held, the defendants were liable not only in respect of the death of the employees but also in respect of the death of the doctor: it was a natural and probable consequence of the defendants' negligence towards the employees that someone would attempt to rescue them; the defences of novus actus interveniens and volenti non fit injuria could not be successfully relied upon against the doctor's dependants. _[Haynes v Harwood [1935] 1 K.B. 146, [1934] 10 WLUK 52](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBBCA8480E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d39ff29e3b6149549e738a3768dc15ee&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied.
