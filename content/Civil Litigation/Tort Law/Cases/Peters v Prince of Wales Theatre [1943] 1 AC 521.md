# Peters v Prince of Wales Theatre [1943] 1 AC 521

 The claimant leased a shop from the defendant, the owner of the theatre next door. The claimant’s shop flooded when pipes from the theatre’s sprinkler system burst. The defendant was not liable. The sprinkler system was equally for the benefit of the claimant and the claimant was deemed to have consented to the use of the sprinkler system since it had been installed prior to him obtaining the lease.
