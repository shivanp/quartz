# Bank St Petersburg PJSC v Arkhangelsky [2018] EWHC 1077 (Ch)

 the claimant individual (actually a counter-claimant, but I will call them claimant for simplicity) alleged that the defendant bank had used the claimant's company's cash-flow difficulties to implement a fraudulent scheme to take control of the company's real estate projects, with the bank allegedly giving much less money for those assets than they were worth. But the defendant argued that those projects, allegedly taken by the bank, maintained their value only because the claimant had bribed certain officials whose support was needed for the projects. The bribery was the alleged illegality, and the defendant said that that illegality tainted the claim.

 

 Judge:

 >“I must admit to some anxiety about the apparent breadth of the discretion conferred upon the Court in determining whether an illegal act is of a quality and closeness to the claim that a person should be deprived of his legal rights”

The defendant argued that bribery is seriously wrongful, constituting a crime and a civil wrong in both England and Russia, and is morally reprehensible: an “evil practice which threatens the foundations of any civilised society”. So presumably the point is that the underlying purpose of the prohibition is one of great importance. The claimant on the other hand said that there is no or no substantial connection between the illegality and the claim, and when the illegal conduct cannot be said to have caused or given rise to the loss, recovery should not be denied by reason of the illegality — so the purpose of the prohibition on bribery would not really be affected by the claim, because the two were sufficiently disconnected.

The defendant argued that there was no relevant public policy which would be adversely affected by denying the claim, and, to quote, “certainly not one which trumps the prohibition on bribery”. The claimant however argued that its claim was one of fraud against the defendant, and there is a strong countervailing public interest in holding defendants who have committed fraud to account. This purpose would be frustrated if the claim was prevented.

The defendant argued that "The English Court can never have encountered so brazen a litigant" as the claimant, who had come to court seeking relief despite bribing an official in the sum of 160 million USD. The claimant argued that it was disproportionate to deprive the claimant of the entirety of the damages to which it was allegedly entitled on account of bribes that are wholly unconnected with the Defendant's dealings with the Claimant. Ultimately, the court decided that the defence of illegality was not made out: in the judge's words,

> “To warrant the Court “drawing up its skirts and refusing all assistance”[…] the illegal conduct would […] have to be not only serious but also central: the springboard for the claim sought to be pursued.”

That was not established on these facts.
