# Jolley v Sutton LBC [2000] 1 WLR 1082

A boat was left abandoned for over two years on land owned by the defendant council. The boat appeared sound but was completely rotten. The claimant, then aged 14, started to repair the boat, using a car jack and some wood to prop it up. While they were working on the boat it fell off the prop, crushing the claimant, who suffered serious spinal injuries resulting in paraplegia. He brought an action against the council for damages in breach of statutory duty under the OLA 1957.

The court held the council liable — the boat was an allurement to children. If it is reasonably foreseeable to an occupier that a child may be attracted to an object on their premises that could be dangerous if meddled with (meaning the child’s actions and injuries are foreseeable), it is reasonable to expect the occupier to take reasonable steps to ensure the premises are safe.

## Summary

J was rendered paraplegic in an accident involving an abandoned derelict boat and SLBC were found to have been in breach of their duty as occupiers pursuant to the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 s.2(2). J appealed against the subsequent reversal of the decision, contending that the Court of Appeal had wrongly concluded that the nature and circumstances of the accident were not reasonably foreseeable. The court held that it was reasonably foreseeable that play, particularly that of teenagers, would involve some mimicry of adult behaviour and there was no distinction between normal play and the boys' endeavours to repair the boat.

## Abstract

J, aged 14, was rendered paraplegic in 1990 when a boat which had been abandoned in 1987, on an area of grass outside a block of flats owned by SLBC, fell upon him as he attempted to effect repairs to the structure. The boat had previously been jacked up by J and another boy, W, aged 13. J commenced proceedings against SLBC alleging breach of the [Occupiers Liability Act 1957 s.2(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B605520E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a3a14c06f23f4ce7884ba2762e863851&contextData=(sc.Default)). At first instance the court gave judgment for J subject to a 25 per cent reduction for contributory negligence, the judge finding that the boat was a trap or allurement to children and the accident reasonably foreseeable. The decision was reversed on appeal to the Court of Appeal, the court holding that the accident was not reasonably foreseeable since the actions of the boys in lifting and propping up the boat were very different activities to normal children's play and that the only foreseeable risk was of injury caused by children climbing on the boat and falling through the rotten wood. J appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the actions of the boys were not so far removed from normal play so as to render them unforeseeable. The judge at first instance had been perceptive in his comment that children's play could include the mimicry of adult behaviour. The Court of Appeal was justified by disturbing the judge's findings of fact on that issue, _[Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963] A.C. 837, [1963] 2 WLUK 78](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC4760FA0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a3a14c06f23f4ce7884ba2762e863851&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock & Engineering Co (The Wagon Mound) [1961] A.C. 388, [1961] 1 WLUK 865](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I14EB2330E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a3a14c06f23f4ce7884ba2762e863851&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.
