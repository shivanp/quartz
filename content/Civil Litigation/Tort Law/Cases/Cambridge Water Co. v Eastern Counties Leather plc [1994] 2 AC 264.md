# Cambridge Water Co. v Eastern Counties Leather plc [1994] 2 AC 264

#key-case

The defendant operated a leather manufacturing business. Over the course of many years, a chemical that the defendant used, seeped through the concrete floor, into the soil below, from where it travelled to the claimant's borehole 1.3 miles away polluting the water. The claimant was forced to relocate its pumping station costing over £1million.

The claim failed: pollution to water in a borehole 1.3 miles away was not reasonably foreseeable. It was not foreseeable that chemicals spilt on a concrete floor could cause damage to the claimant’s water.

## Abstract

Foreseeability of harm of the relevant type by the defendant is a prerequisite of the recovery of damages both in nuisance and under the rule in Rylands. D used and stored a chlorinated solvent at its tannery, situated just over a mile from P's borehole, where water was abstracted for domestic use. The water became unfit for human consumption, having been contaminated by the solvent which had seeped into the ground below D's premises and been conveyed in percolating water towards the borehole. P claimed damages on three alternate grounds, negligence, nuisance and the rule in Rylands. The actions in negligence and nuisance were dismissed by the trial judge on the ground that D could not reasonably have foreseen the damage that occurred, and the claim based on the rule in Rylands was dismissed on the ground that the storage and use of the solvent was, in the circumstances, a natural use of D's land. On P's appeal against the dismissal of the third cause of action, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, but declined to determine it on the basis of the rule in Rylands, holding instead that there was a parallel rule of strict liability in nuisance. D appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) foreseeability of harm of the relevant type by the defendant was a prerequisite of the recovery of damages both in nuisance and under the rule in Rylands ;

(2) accordingly, and notwithstanding that the storage of the solvent constituted a non-natural use of D's land, since P could not establish that the pollution which occurred was in the circumstances foreseeable, the action failed (_[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Miller Steamship Co Pty Ltd [1967] 1 A.C. 617, [1966] 5 WLUK 92](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I14EA38D0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a8a7f011ec9443796858818828ae7d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Rylands v Fletcher (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 330, [1868] 7 WLUK 83](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I913A6901E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a8a7f011ec9443796858818828ae7d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[West v Bristol Tramways Co [1908] 2 K.B. 14, [1908] 3 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7E49B30E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a8a7f011ec9443796858818828ae7d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Rickards v Lothian [1913] A.C. 263, [1913] 2 WLUK 35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I880E6340E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a8a7f011ec9443796858818828ae7d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Rainham Chemical Works Ltd (In Liquidation) v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd [1921] 2 A.C. 465, [1921] 7 WLUK 211](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I80482F10E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a8a7f011ec9443796858818828ae7d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ , _[Read v J Lyons & Co Ltd [1947] A.C. 156, [1946] 10 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I84B65EA0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6a8a7f011ec9443796858818828ae7d3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered; _[Ballard v Tomlinson (1885) 29 Ch.
