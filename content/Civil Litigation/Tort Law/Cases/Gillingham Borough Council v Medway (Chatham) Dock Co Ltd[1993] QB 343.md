# Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd[1993] QB 343

A predominately residential area became a commercial port following planning permission, which resulted in heavy traffic, noise and fumes on residential roads. At one point, it was recorded that a lorry passed every 1.5 minutes in the early morning. Residents complained of interrupted sleep and general disturbance. The claim failed as planning permission had changed the nature of the locality to a wholly commercial area which was benefiting the community. The court considered the locality as it was after the planning permission was granted.
