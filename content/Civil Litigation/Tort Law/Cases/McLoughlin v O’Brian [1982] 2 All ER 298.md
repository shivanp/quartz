## Abstract

The House of Lords extended liability for nervous shock to all cases where it was reasonably foreseeable that the plaintiff would suffer such injury, irrespective of any limitations of time and space. One of M's children was killed and her husband and other two children were severely injured in a road accident. The incident was reported to M while she was at her home, some two miles from the scene. At the hospital, M saw the extent of the injuries to her family and heard of the death of her daughter, as a result of which she suffered severe and persisting nervous shock, for which she claimed damages.

Held, that the test of liability for nervous shock is the ordinary test of reasonable foreseeability. If it was reasonably foreseeable that M would suffer nervous shock, even though nowhere near the scene of the accident, she was entitled to recover. In considering the question of reasonable foreseeability there are no legal limitations of time, space, distance, nature of injuries, or the relationship of victim to plaintiff, although these are all factors to be considered (_[Bourhill v Young [1943] A.C. 92, [1942] 8 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I77000B40E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8ecb835c52f48d686a72631c66046d0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Hambrook v Stokes Bros [1925] 1 K.B. 141, [1924] 11 WLUK 35](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB92729E0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8ecb835c52f48d686a72631c66046d0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[King v Phillips [1953] 1 Q.B. 429, [1953] 2 WLUK 83](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID43743A0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c8ecb835c52f48d686a72631c66046d0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ dictum approved).
