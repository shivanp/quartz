# White v Blackmore [1972] 2 QB 651

The claimant spectator was at a car rally. Notices on the site stated that there was danger. When standing behind the rope barrier, a wheel from one of the vehicles caught the rope, released it and catapulted the claimant 20 yards thereby killing him. Volenti did not apply as the claimant **was not fully aware of the particular risk** caused by the inadequate barrier.
