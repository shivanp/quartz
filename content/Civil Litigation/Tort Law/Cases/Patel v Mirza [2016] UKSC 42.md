# Patel v Mirza [2016] UKSC 42

Patel paid a large sum of money for Mr Mirza to bet on the changes in share prices. Mr Mirza expected to receive 'inside information' about the shares concerned. The parties were therefore pursuing 'insider dealing' and this made the agreement between them illegal. The bet did not actually go ahead because the inside information was not received, and Mr Patel sought the return of the money. Mr Mirza defended this claim on the basis of illegality — that Mr Patel was involved in an illegal transaction and the court should not, therefore, allow Mr Patel's claim.

The Supreme Court applied the three considerations from the test, and the defence was unsuccessful. Mr Patel recovered his money.

(1) What was the underlying purpose of the prohibition transgressed and would that purpose be enhanced by denying the claim? The court found that the offence of insider trading aims to prevent market abuse by the exploitation of insider information. In this case, no such activity had actually occurred, and so denying the claim seemed unnecessary.

(2) Other relevant public policy which may be rendered ineffective or less effective by denial of the claim: no policies were identified in this case, but arguably allowing Mr Mirza to raise this defence would allow him to unfairly profit from the arrangement; and

(3) Whether denying the claim would be a proportionate response to the illegality. In seeking the return of the money, Mr Patel was not seeking to make a benefit from his wrongdoing — the illegality was not central to the claim. He was simply trying to 'unwind' what would have been an illegal transaction. To prevent him from recovering the money which was never in fact used for the purpose for which it was paid would not have been just and proportionate, remembering that the purpose of civil law is not to punish Mr Patel. In addition, Mr Mirza was equally culpable.
