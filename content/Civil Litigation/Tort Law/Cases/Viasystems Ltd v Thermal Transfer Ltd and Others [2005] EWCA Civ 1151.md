# Viasystems Ltd v Thermal Transfer Ltd and Others [2005] EWCA Civ 1151

## Summary

Two separate employers could both be vicariously liable for the negligence of a single employee.

## Abstract

The appellant (D3) appealed against the decision that it was vicariously liable for the negligence of a fitter's mate who had caused a flood at a factory.

The claimant (C) had engaged the first defendant (D1) to install air conditioning in C's factory. D1 had subcontracted ducting work to the second defendant (D2) and D2 had contracted with D3 to provide fitters and fitters' mates on a labour only basis. A fitter's mate supplied by D3, who was working with a fitter supplied by D3, both under the supervision of a fitter contracted to D2, negligently caused a flood. The judge determined that D3 and not D2 was vicariously liable for the negligence of the fitter's mate. The issue on appeal was whether both D2 and D3, rather than only one of them, could be vicariously liable for the negligence of the fitter's mate. D3 submitted that dual vicarious liability was not a legal possibility and that D2 alone should be liable. D2 submitted that D3 alone should be liable but that dual vicarious liability was a legal possibility.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) correctly formulated, **the question to determine vicarious liability was who was entitled to exercise control over the relevant act or operation** of the fitter's mate. To look for a transfer of a contract of employment was distracting and misleading. The fitter's mate's employment was not transferred. The inquiry should concentrate on the relevant negligent act and then ask whose responsibility it was to prevent it: who was entitled and obliged to give orders as to how the work should or should not be done. Entire and absolute control was not a necessary precondition of vicarious liability, _[Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) Ltd [1947] A.C. 1, [1946] 7 WLUK 56](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF950F1E1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f693c868439145d59d79f5d520a60a22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Denham v Midland Employers Mutual Assurance [1955] 2 Q.B. 437, [1955] 5 WLUK 89](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I966FAE90E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f693c868439145d59d79f5d520a60a22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.

(2) On the facts of the instant case both D2's fitter and D3's fitter had been entitled, and if they had had the opportunity obliged, to prevent the mate's negligence.

(3) It had been assumed since the early 19th century to be the law that where an employee who was lent by one employer to work for another was negligent, liability had to rest on one employer or the other, but not both. But the foundation on which that rested was a slender one and the contrary had never been properly argued. There was no authority binding the court to hold that dual vicarious liability was legally impossible, _[Donovan v Laing Wharton and Down Construction Syndicate Ltd [1893] 1 Q.B. 629, [1893] 3 WLUK 4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9A0160D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f693c868439145d59d79f5d520a60a22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Hall Russell & Co Ltd (The Esso Bernicia) [1989] A.C. 643, [1988] 10 WLUK 61](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA212A7C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f693c868439145d59d79f5d520a60a22&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered.

(4) Dual vicarious liability was legally possible and both D2 and D3 were vicariously liable for the mate's negligence.

(5) If the relevant relationships led to the conclusion of dual control over the employee, it was likely that the measure of control was equal. That was so in the instant case and, applying the [Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I603C8C20E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f693c868439145d59d79f5d520a60a22&contextData=(sc.Default)) , the just and equitable division of responsibility between D2 and D3 was equal. D2 and D3 should contribute 50 per cent of their several liabilities to C.
