# Giles v Walker (1890) 24 QBD 656

Seeds from some thistles on the defendant’s land blew into neighbouring land owned by the claimant and damaged his crops. The defendant was not liable as he had not brought the thistles onto his land and there can not be liability under _[Rylands v Fletcher](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/cases/Rylands-v-Fletcher.php)_ for a thing which naturally accumulates on land.

NB This point of law was doubted in _[Leakey v National Trust](http://www.e-lawresources.co.uk/cases/Leakey-v-National-Trust.php)_
