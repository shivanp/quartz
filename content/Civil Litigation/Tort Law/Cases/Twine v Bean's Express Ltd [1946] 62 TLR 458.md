# Twine v Bean's Express Ltd [1946] 62 TLR 458

Despite express instructions not to do so, the lorry driver (an employee) picked up a hitchhiker, who was subsequently injured as a result of the driver's negligent driving. The Court of Appeal found that the hitchhiker was a trespasser and the employee was not acting within the scope of employment as he was doing something expressly prohibited. A consideration of policy is probably helpful in squaring the decisions made. In **_Rose_** Denning LJ distinguished the facts from those of **_Twine_** on the basis that in **_Rose_** the prohibited act was being done for the purpose of the employer's business (the boy was helping the milkman to deliver milk), but this was not the case in **_Twine_.**

A driver was engaged to drive his employers’ van, his employers having a contract with the Post Office. When so doing, he gave Mr. Twine a lift from A to B, both offices of the Post Office. The driver had been expressly forbidden to give lifts.  

Held: The express prohibition upon giving lifts was not only a prohibition but was also a limiting factor on the scope of the employment. The driver was not acting in the course of his employment. Lord Greene said: ‘The other thing which he was doing simultaneously was something totally outside the scope of his employment – namely, giving a lift to a person who had no right whatsoever to be there.’
