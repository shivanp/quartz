# Ratcliff v McConnell and Harper Adams College [1997] EWCA Civ 2

A drunk student climbed over a locked gate to access the college’s swimming pool. There was a notice at the entrance stating that the pool would be locked, and use was prohibited from 10pm to 6.30am. There was a notice at the shallow end in red on a white background saying, ‘shallow end’. He dived in, broke his neck and was paralysed.

No duty was owed and even if one existed, the defendants discharged this duty. The only incidence of trespass in the four years prior to the claimant’s injury related to students from a visiting college, and therefore there was no reason for the college to suspect the students would come into the danger. By surrounding the pool with a seven-foot-high fence, a locked gate and warnings, the college had offered a reasonable level of protection.

Even if there had been a breach, the defence of consent would have been successful. The claimant was well aware of the risks of diving into a shallow pool, and he could not rely upon the fact that he was drunk. He was of full capacity and had voluntarily chosen to engage in an activity which carried an inherent risk.
