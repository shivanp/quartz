# Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11

The claimant was of small build and diabetic. Evidence showed that diabetes can lead to larger babies. During delivery of the claimant’s baby, the baby’s shoulders got stuck (shoulder dystocia) and he was starved of oxygen, resulting in brain damage. The claimant argued that she should have been warned of the risks of shoulder dystocia, and that had she been so warned, she would have asked for a caesarean section. The obstetrician had not warned about shoulder dystocia because the risk was so small. At trial, some of the experts supported this view.

**Decision in _Montgomery_ **

Medical professionals are under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of **any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments**. A material risk is one which **a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to**. This is so the patient can give their informed consent.

However, a medical professional can withhold information as to a risk if they reasonably consider that its disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the patient's health. Medical professionals are also excused from conferring with the patient in circumstances of necessity, for example where the patient requires treatment urgently but is unconscious.

The obstetrician was in breach of duty for failing to warn the claimant of the material risk of shoulder dystocia.

The court stated that the _Bolam_ test is concerned with the exercise of professional expertise. However, some decisions that a doctor (for example) makes are not connected with medical expertise. The decision about whether or not to advise as to risks was such a decision: it had more to do with the way in which the doctor-patient relationship should be viewed than it did medical expertise. Accordingly, the _Bolam_ test is not relevant when considering a failure to advise as to risks – a medical professional is required to consider matters primarily from the patient’s point of view.
