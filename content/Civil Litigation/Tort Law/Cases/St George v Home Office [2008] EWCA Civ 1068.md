# St George v Home Office [2008] EWCA Civ 1068

The claimant was a prisoner who fell out of a top bunk bed during a seizure caused by withdrawal from drugs. Prison staff had failed to adequately look after him, despite knowing of the risk of withdrawal seizures.

It was held that it was inappropriate to reduce the claimant's damages on the basis that his own role in creating the addiction amounted to contributory negligence, because having told the prison officers about the risk of seizures, it would not be equitable to reduce his damages for that reason.
