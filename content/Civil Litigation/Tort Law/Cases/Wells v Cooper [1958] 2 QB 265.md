# Wells v Cooper [1958] 2 QB 265

The defendant fixed his doorknob. When the claimant opened the door, the doorknob came away from the door and the claimant slipped, fell and injured himself. There were two standards to choose from, that of the reasonably competent professional carpenter and that of the reasonably competent amateur carpenter. The Court of Appeal held the defendant to the standard of the reasonably competent amateur carpenter, which was lower than the standard expected of a professional. The job in question was a trivial domestic replacement. Had the job been something more ambitious, the standard might have been different.
