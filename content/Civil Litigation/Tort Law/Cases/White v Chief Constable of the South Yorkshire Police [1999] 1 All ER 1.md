# White v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police [1999] 1 All ER 1

The claimants were **police officers on duty** during the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. They assisted in removing the dead bodies and carrying the injured to safety as well as trying to resuscitate spectators. Their action was for post-traumatic stress disorder. Their status as employees and professional rescuers did not convert them from secondary to primary victims (it is easier to establish a duty if you are a primary victim). They were secondary victims as they had not been exposed to danger, so the ordinary criteria for establishing a duty in respect of secondary victims (as set out in _Alcock_, discussed later) applied.
