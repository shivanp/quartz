# Matania v National Provincial Bank [1936] 2 All ER 633

Building work does not normally form the basis of a private nuisance claim, but in _Matania_ the temporary interference (three months) had serious consequences for the claimant, a music teacher, who could not earn his living whilst the contractors altered the property. If an occupier asks an independent contractor onto their land to perform certain tasks and those tasks cause an **inevitable nuisance**, there will be liability.
