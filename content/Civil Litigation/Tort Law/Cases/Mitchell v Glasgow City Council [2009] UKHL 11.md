# Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] UKHL 11

## Facts

- Drummond and the claimant’s husband were engaged in a long running dispute; both were tenants of the local authority
- Drummond was summoned to a meeting where he was told that he would be evicted. Upon his return, he fatally assaulted the claimant’s husband

## Issue

- Could the local authority be liable for not warning Mr Mitchell of the meeting

## Decision

- No liability
- Under common law, foreseeability alone is not enough to justify a duty of care, nor is it fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty where the original purpose is for the good of the general community
- There was no violation of article 2 of the ECHR, there was no reason for the council to believe that there was a ‘real and immediate risk’ to the life of the claimant’s husband

## Summary

A **duty to warn** another person that he was at risk of loss, injury or damage as the result of the criminal act of a third party would arise **only where the person who was said to be under that duty had by his words or conduct assumed responsibility for the safety of the person who was at risk**. In the instant case, the local authority had not been under a duty to warn a tenant that his neighbour might resort to violence after being informed that he risked being evicted.

## Abstract

The appellant local authority appealed against a decision (_[[2008] CSIH 19, 2008 S.C. 351](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5CC5D710F70C11DC8CFFBB62B7535528/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5a89c86aa9a54f2489951e6e9be6d992&contextData=(sc.Default))_) allowing a proof before answer on the case of the respondents (M) in negligence. M cross-appealed against the court's decision to exclude from probation their averments that the local authority had acted incompatibly with the [European Convention on Human Rights 1950 art.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1B58031DEC86485FA3AEEFBD8980CD10/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5a89c86aa9a54f2489951e6e9be6d992&contextData=(sc.Default)).

M were the widow and daughter of a man (D) who had been attacked and killed by his next-door neighbour (X). D and X were tenants of the local authority. In 1994, X used an iron bar to batter D's door and smash his windows after D had tried to get him to turn the volume of his music down. Thereafter X made repeated threats to kill D and intimidated other residents.

On July 26, 2001, the local authority wrote to X inviting him to a meeting to be held on July 31. He was told that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss a recent incident involving D and a notice of proceedings for recovery of possession that had been served on him earlier that year, as consideration was being given to the issuing of a further notice. X attended the meeting and was told that a fresh notice of proceedings to recover possession would be served on him. X lost his temper and became abusive but then apologised.

After leaving the meeting, he returned home and fatally assaulted D. M's case in negligence and under art.2 of the Convention was that the local authority had a duty to warn D of the risk that he faced given the meeting that was taking place on July 31 and the steps being taken against X.

## Held

Appeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed.

(1) The approach of Lord Goff in _[Maloco v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987] A.C. 241, [1987] 2 WLUK 73](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IED7C8870E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5a89c86aa9a54f2489951e6e9be6d992&contextData=(sc.Default))_ to the problem that arose in cases where harm was caused by a third party's wrongdoing was the one that should be applied to the problem raised by this case. The case involved an allegation that it was the local authority's duty to prevent the risk of harm being caused to D by the criminal act of a third party which it did not create and had not undertaken to avert.

The point at issue was whether the local authority was under a duty in that situation to warn D that there was a risk that X would resort to violence. Cases of this kind which arose from another's deliberate wrongdoing could not be founded simply on the degree of foreseeability. If the local authority was to be held responsible in such circumstances, it had to be because the situation was one where it was readily understandable that the law should regard the local authority as under a responsibility to take care to protect the pursuer from that risk, Maloco applied. The crucial question was whether, acknowledging that the local authority was the landlord of D and X, that relationship was such that it was fair, just and reasonable that it should be held liable in damages for the omissions to warn that were relied on.

Applying the tests of fairness and public policy, the answer was no, _[Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1989] Q.B. 653, [1988] 7 WLUK 385](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I821B36D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5a89c86aa9a54f2489951e6e9be6d992&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The implications of saying that there was a duty to warn were complex and far-reaching. Imposing such a duty would give rise to practical difficulties and might deter social landlords from intervening to reduce the incidence of antisocial behaviour. As a general rule, a duty to warn another person that he was at risk of loss, injury or damage as the result of the criminal act of a third party would arise only where the person who was said to be under that duty had by his words or conduct assumed responsibility for the safety of the person who was at risk.

(2) There was no good reason why, as a general guide to what was required, the "fair, just and reasonable" test established in _[Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605, [1990] 2 WLUK 128](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I821B84F0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5a89c86aa9a54f2489951e6e9be6d992&contextData=(sc.Default))_ should not be regarded as part of Scots law. There was no principle of Scots law that contradicted it, and the fact that the law of liability for negligence had developed on common lines both north and south of the border provided powerful support for the argument that it should be applied in this case, Caparo applied.

(3) As to M's case under art.2, the issue was whether the local authority ought to have known that, when X left the meeting, there was a "real and immediate risk" to D's life, _[Osman v United Kingdom (23452/94) [1999] 1 F.L.R. 193, [1998] 10 WLUK 513](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I14AEDD80E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=5a89c86aa9a54f2489951e6e9be6d992&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. Taking M's averments at their highest, there was nothing to suggest that his life was really at risk at all, let alone that any such risk was immediate. The only previous incident involving violence by X against D had taken place in 1994 and, although X lost his temper at the meeting and was abusive, he was not said to have uttered any threats against D or to have been armed with any kind of weapon. In short, he did not say or do anything to alert the local authority to a risk that he would attack D when he got home, let alone that he would inflict injuries from which D might die.
