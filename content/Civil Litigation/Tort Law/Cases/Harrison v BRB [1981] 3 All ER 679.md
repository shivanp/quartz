# Harrison v BRB [1981] 3 All ER 679

The plaintiff was the guard on the train, and he saw the defendant attempting to board a moving train. Instead of signaling the driver to stop or to apply the emergency brakes, he gave the incorrect signal which resulted in the train continuing to accelerate away from the station. The plaintiff then tried to grab hold of the defendant who fell off the train and therefore injured the plaintiff. Despite holding the defendant liable for the plaintiff’s injury, the Court found that had the plaintiff given the correct signal or applied the emergency brakes, he would probably have reduced the possibility of injury and its severity. Accordingly, the Court reduced the damages recoverable by the plaintiff by 20 per cent.
