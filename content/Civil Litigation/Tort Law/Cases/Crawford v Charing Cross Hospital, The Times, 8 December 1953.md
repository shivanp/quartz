# Crawford v Charing Cross Hospital, The Times, 8 December 1953

In _Crawford v Board of Governors of Charing Cross Hospital_, a patient sustained a brachial plexus injury from being in one position for too long a time period. An article describing such a complication had been published 6 months previously. However, the anaesthetist had not read this article and was not aware of its implications and so was found not to have breached their duty of care to the patient.

The claimant suffered Brachial Palsy whilst having a blood transfusion during surgery. His argument was that the anaesthetist should have been aware of such a risk from an article in the Lancet published six months earlier (the Lancet is a leading medical journal). The court rejected the claim for negligence saying it would be both impractical and unrealistic to expect a professional to know every new development in their field at any given moment in time.
