# Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562

**Facts:** The claimant’s friend bought her a ginger beer, which came in an opaque bottle, in a café. After drinking some of the beer, to the claimant’s horror, when the remainder was poured, it was found to contain a decomposed snail. The claimant claimed she was made ill by this but was unable to sue the café owner, as there was no contract between them as her friend had bought the ginger beer. Instead, she sued the manufacturer.

Loss: gastroenteritis. Also said she'd suffered 'nervous shock' (psychiatric injury).

**Held:** The House of Lords, by a narrow majority, allowed her to succeed and decided that a manufacturer owed a duty to the ultimate consumer. This was of great importance, since, prior to this case, manufacturers had only been held liable to consumers in limited situations.

Occured in Scotland. Was a preliminary application - a plea of relevancy. In English law called a striking out application. Can argue this if claim displays no cause of action. House of Lords faced with conflicting authorities. Decision was to protect the public health.

Not everyone agreed. Lord Buckmaster:

> if one step, why not 50?
