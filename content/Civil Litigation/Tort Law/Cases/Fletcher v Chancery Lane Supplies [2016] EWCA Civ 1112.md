# Fletcher v Chancery Lane Supplies [2016] EWCA Civ 1112

The claimant cyclist collided with an employee of the defendant, a pedestrian who was crossing the road without looking properly. The defendant had a shop and office on opposite sides of the road. At the time of crossing the road the tortfeasor was wearing his company uniform with the company logo and work boots, but the accident happened 40 minutes after his shift ended. He was near the shop where he worked but there was no evidence that his crossing the road was linked to his job (no evidence he was heading back to the shop/office).

The court applied the approach from _Mohamud:_ was there a connection between his work and the negligence? There was no close connection as it was impossible to know if crossing the road was sufficiently connected to the tortfeasor's work at the time to make it reasonable to find his employer vicariously liable because it was unknown why the tortfeasor had been crossing the road.
