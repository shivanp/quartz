# Nettleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691

#key-case

## Facts

The defendant was a learner driver. She was taking lessons from a friend. The friend checked that the defendant's insurance covered her for passengers before agreeing to go out with her. On one of the lessons Mrs Weston turned a bend, Mr Nettleship told her to straighten the wheel but Mrs Weston panicked and failed to straighten the wheel. She approached the pavement and Mr Nettleship grabbed the handbrake and tried to straighten the wheel but it was too late. She mounted the pavement and hit a lamp post. Mr Nettleship fractured his knee. The defendant argued that the standard of care should be lowered for learner drivers and she also raised the defence of _volenti non fit injuria_ in that in agreeing to get in the car knowing she was a learner, he had voluntarily accepted the risk. Â   

  

## Held

  

A learner driver is expected to meet the same standard as a reasonable qualified competent driver. _Volenti_ did not apply as he had checked the insurance cover which demonstrated he did not waive any rights to compensation. His damages were reduced by 50% under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 to reflect the degree to which he was also at fault.

## Analysis

Decision in Nettleship best understood as resting on a pragmatic factor of compulsory motor insurance. The defendant is made liable so the claimant can be compensated out of the insurance fund. So the Court of Appeal elevates the function of tort as a mechanism of compensation over that of achieving corrective justice.

Lord Denning:

- Morally the learner driver is not at fault, but legally she is liable because she is insured and the risk should fall on her. Moving away from 'no liability without fault' and towards 'to whom should the risk fall'.
- Also for consistently and certainty - otherwise rules would be a mess.
- In cases where criminal charges, civil law should march alongside criminal law. In Nettleship, learner was criminally charged.

> Thus we are, in this branch of the law, moving away from the concept: "No liability without fault." We are beginning to apply the test: "On whom should the risk fall?" Morally the learner driver is not at fault; but legally she is liable to be because she is insured and the risk should fall on her.
