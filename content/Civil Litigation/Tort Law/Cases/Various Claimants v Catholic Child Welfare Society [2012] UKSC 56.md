# Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56

## Facts:

Various Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society and others [2012] UKSC 56 was concerned with the abusive behaviour by brother teachers at a Christian school for boys. Furthermore, this was a concern even though the institute did not manage the school.

Moreover, former children at the children’s homes had sought damages for sexual and physical abuse.

## Issue:

The issue on appeal was whether the Institute could be jointly vicariously liable with the managers for alleged abuse by staff members.  
Held:

In conclusion, the SC allowed the appeal. Thus, it was held to be fair and just and reasonable for the defendants to share liability.

## Test:

Lord Phillips, giving the key judgment, confirmed the test of vicarious liability of two stages:

   >Firstly, whether the relationship between the tortfeasor and the defendant was one that was capable of giving rise to vicarious liability;  
   >An examination of the connection between the relationship and the wrongful act or omission.

Ultimately, Lord Phillips considered the relationship between the teaching brothers and the Institute was “sufficiently akin to that of employer and employees” to satisfy stage 1 of the test.

Furthermore, Lord Phillips stated that the necessary close connection was established by drawing on the objectives of the Institute to provide a Christian education to boys. Moreover, the recognition of the risk of abuse in the brother-teachers’ rules.

Finally, because the rule dealing with chastity explicitly prohibited the touching of children.
