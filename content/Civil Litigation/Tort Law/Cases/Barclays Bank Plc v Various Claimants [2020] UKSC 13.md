# Barclays Bank Plc v Various Claimants [2020] UKSC 13

Barclays required prospective employees to undergo a medical examination, at a time and place specified by Barclays, otherwise they would not be offered employment. The medical examinations were conducted by Dr Bates and it transpired he had assaulted a number of the young women he examined. Should Barclays be vicariously liable for those assaults? Dr Bates was not employed by Barclays. He had been chosen by the bank, was often described as 'the bank's doctor' and carried out examinations as specified by Barclays. Despite these elements of 'control' by Barclays, Dr Bates was carrying on his own independent business as a medical practitioner with a portfolio of patients and clients, of whom only one was Barclays. His relationship with Barclays was not akin to employment, and Barclays were not vicariously liable for his actions.
