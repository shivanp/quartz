# Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 583

## Fact

The claimant was undergoing electro convulsive therapy as treatment for his mental illness. The doctor did not give any relaxant drugs and the claimant suffered a serious fracture. There was divided opinion amongst professionals as to whether relaxant drugs should be given. If they are given there is a very small risk of death, if they are not given there is a small risk of fractures. The claimant argued that the doctor was in breach of duty by not using the relaxant drug.  

  

## Held

  

The doctor was not in breach of duty. The House of Lords formulated the Bolam test:  

> "a medical professional is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art â€¦ Putting it the other way round, a man is not negligent, if he is acting in accordance with such a practice, merely because there is a body of opinion who would take a contrary view."  
> Justice McNair

Bolam test applicable to any profession, not just the medical profession.

### Summary

A doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular form of treatment. This case is the basis for the "Bolam test" in negligence to determine the standard of reasonable care for doctors and other professionals.

### Abstract

The plaintiff brought a claim for negligence against the defendant hospital.

The plaintiff sustained fractures of the acetabula during the course of electro-convulsive therapy treatment given him while he was a voluntary patient at the defendants' mental hospital. He claimed damages against the hospital alleging that the defendants were negligent  
(1) in failing to administer any relaxant drug prior to the passing of the current through his brain;  
(2) since they had not administered such drug, in failing to provide at least some form of manual restraint or control beyond that given; and  
(3) in failing to warn him of the risks involved in the treatment.

Expert witnesses all agreed that there was a firm body of medical opinion opposed to the use of relaxant drugs, and also that a number of competent practitioners considered that the less manual restraint there was, the less was the risk of fracture. It was the practice of the defendants' doctors not to warn their patients of the risks of the treatment (which they believed to be small) unless asked.

### Held

Judgment for defendants.

The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. A doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular form of treatment; nor is he negligent merely because there is a body of opinion which would adopt a different technique. In deciding whether a doctor is negligent in failing to warn a patient of the risks involved in a particular treatment, it is appropriate to consider firstly whether good medical practice required that a warning should have been given to the patient before he submitted to the treatment, and, secondly, if a warning had been given, what difference it would have made.
