# Murphy v Brentwood District Council [1990] 2 All ER 908

#key-case

## Facts

The claimant bought a house which subsequently developed structural defects because of inadequate foundations. The foundations had been approved by the Council. The claimant sold the house for Â£35,000 less than it would have fetched without the defect.

## Held

The loss suffered was pure economic loss and not recoverable. The only thing suffering damage was the house itself which had always been inherently defective because of the foundations. Therefore, any cost of repairs, or reduction in value to the property was pure economic loss. No physical damage had occurred to any person or other property. Thus, the House of Lords confirmed that the cost of repairing inherently defective products was rightly classified as pure economic loss.

If the defective property damages other property, it is recoverable, but the loss from the defective property itself is not recoverable.

### Abstract

A local authority is not liable in tort for negligent application of the building regulations, where the resulting defects are discovered before physical injury occurs. The loss suffered is purely economic. In 1970, M bought one of a pair of houses built on a concrete raft foundation on an in-fill site. The raft was defective and differential settlement occurred. M was unable to repair the defect, and sold the house, sustaining a loss of GBP 35,000. He sued the council for negligent approval of the plans, claiming that there had been an imminent risk to health and safety from fractured gas and oil pipes.

Held, that the loss suffered was economic loss and the council were not liable in tort for negligent application of the building regulations where resulting defects had not caused physical injury ( _[Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman [1955-95] P.N.L.R. 238, [1985] 7 WLUK 74](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC6BA16C0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4b410485fc7948b0976834b8606100e3&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ followed; _[Dutton v Bognor Regis Building Co Ltd [1972] 1 Q.B. 373, [1971] 12 WLUK 124](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9C79B3D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4b410485fc7948b0976834b8606100e3&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ , _[Anns v Merton LBC [1978] A.C. 728, [1977] 5 WLUK 94](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5E758AF0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4b410485fc7948b0976834b8606100e3&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ overruled).
