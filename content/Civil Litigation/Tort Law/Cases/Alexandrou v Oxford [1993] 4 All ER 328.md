# Alexandrou v Oxford [1993] 4 All ER 328

## Facts

The claimant owned a clothing retail shop in which he had installed a burglar alarm system which if activated would raise the alarm at his local police station through an automated 999 call. The shop was burgled but the police failed to secure the property. The Claimant brought an action in negligence against the Chief Constable. At trial, the judge found for the claimant. The Defendant appealed contending that no duty of care was owed.  

  

## Held

  

In the absence of a direct contractual relationship with the Chief Constable, no duty of care was owed.
