# Lejonvarn v Burgess [2017] EWCA Civ 254

The same approach was applied, in circumstances where the defendant supplied professional services, free of charge, to friends relating to the landscaping of their garden. The Court of Appeal found that the defendant architect, who supplied those professional services, owed a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care for any work done by her. Although the claimants were not her clients in a contractual sense (no contract, no payment), they were clients in a professional sense: she possessed a special skill and had assumed responsibility for the work, on which the claimants had relied.

## Summary

An architect who had supplied her professional services to friends free of charge had been under no contractual duty to provide the services, but any work done had to be done with reasonable skill and care. She owed her friends a duty of care in tort because, although not clients in a contractual sense, they were clients in a professional sense: she possessed a special skill and had assumed a responsibility on which they had relied.

## Abstract

An architect who had supplied her professional services to friends free of charge appealed against a decision that she owed them a duty of care.

The architect had agreed to help her friends, the respondents, with a project to landscape their garden. For no fee, she secured a contractor, who carried out the earthworks and hard landscaping. The architect intended to provide subsequent design work, for which she would charge a fee. However, the project did not get that far because the respondents were unhappy with the quality and progress of the work. They brought proceedings claiming that the architect was responsible for the defective work. A trial of preliminary issues was ordered to determine whether they could claim against the architect in contract or in tort. The judge determined that there was no contract, because it was not possible to identify an offer and acceptance, or consideration, and because there had been no intention to create contractual relations. He found the architect to owe a common law duty of care because she possessed a special skill and had assumed a responsibility on which her friends had relied. He held that she had acted as project manager, not as a mere conduit or facilitator between the contractor and the respondents, and that just because the services had been free, did not mean that they were informal or social. He recognised that the losses claimed were purely economic.

The architect submitted that the judge had been wrong to find that  
(1) a duty of care existed when he also found that there was no concluded contract;  
(2) there was a duty of care to inspect and supervise the works;  
(3) there was a duty of care in respect of the design of the garden works;  
(4) there was a duty of care to exercise cost control and budgeting;  
(5) the architect had agreed to provide all of the services to which a duty of care was said to attach, and had, in fact, provided such services.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The fact that the judge had found there to be no contract did not mean that the parties' relationship could not be akin to a contractual one. Offer and acceptance, and an intention to create legal relations were relevant considerations, but they were not determinative. The judge had found that the scope of the services for which responsibility was being assumed was reasonably clear. He gave express regard to the fact that they were provided free of charge, but found that they were nevertheless provided on a professional footing because of the architect's expectation that they would lead to paid work and help to grow her business. It was generally accepted that a builder did not owe a duty of care to protect against economic loss in relation to the execution of his work, and the architect submitted that it was anomalous for her to owe a duty where the contractor did not. However, there was a distinction between a builder and a professional: professionals expected others to act in reliance on their work product, often with financial or other economic consequences. The architect had provided services that could not be provided by the contractor, and although the respondents were not her clients in a contractual sense, they were in a professional sense. The judge had been entitled to conclude that there had been an assumption of responsibility and that it was appropriate, fair, just and reasonable for a duty of care to arise. The duty was not to provide the professional services which she had undertaken to provide, but to exercise reasonable skill and care in doing so (see paras [74-88](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) There was no reason in principle why a duty of care could not be owed to avoid economic loss in connection with the supervision of another's work where the supervision was part of a professional service for which responsibility had been assumed and where the supervision was negligently performed. The architect had had a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in directing, inspecting and supervising the contractor's work, including its timing and progress (paras [94-99](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) The architect had not merely said that she would produce designs, but had actually done so. She had not been under any positive obligation to produce the design work, but any such work done had to be done with reasonable skill and care (paras [104-106](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) The architect knew that costs and a reasonably accurate budget were crucial to the respondents. She had offered to provide, and did provide, a service which included receiving applications for payment from the contractor and advising the respondents about their payment. She had owed a duty of care in so doing (paras [117-118](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(5) The combination of what the architect said she would do, and did do, against the background found by the judge, justified his finding of a duty of care in relation to the provision of the services. There was no reason to interfere with the judge's findings that the services had been provided. He had not addressed the detail of the services, nor sought to identify all relevant acts or advice, but it had been neither necessary nor appropriate for him to do so for the purpose of the preliminary issue hearing (paras [123, 125](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
