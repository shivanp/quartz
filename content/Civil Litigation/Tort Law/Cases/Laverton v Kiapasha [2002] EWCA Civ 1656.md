# Laverton v Kiapasha [2002] EWCA Civ 1656

It had been raining and the defendant’s takeaway shop floor was wet. The claimant slipped over and broke her ankle. The defendant had done all that could reasonably be expected of them — they had slip-resistant tiles, a doormat to limit the water brought in on the feet of customers and a system of mopping up water six or seven times a night. More might have been expected from larger businesses, for example, mats large enough to absorb moisture from a large number of customers and a staff member stationed near the door to mop up as required.
