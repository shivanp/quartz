# Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd [2002] 1 AC 215

#key-case

The defendant company, who ran a children's home for boys, was held vicariously liable for sexual abuse committed by one of its employees, a house warden.

Lord Steyn stated that the correct approach when determining this issue 'is to concentrate on the **relative closeness of the connection between the nature of the employment and the particular tort**.' In this case, the warden's torts were closely connected with his employment as it was because of his position that he was able to exploit the children, so it was held to be fair and just to hold the employer vicariously liable. The tort was committed on **the employer's premises during working hours** whilst he was caring for the children in **performing his duties**.
