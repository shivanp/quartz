# Black v Fife Coal Ltd [1912] AC 149

The husband of the pursuer was killed by an outbreak of poisonous gas while working in the employment of the defenders, a limited company, in a coal mine of which they were owners. In an action for damages at common law and alternatively under the Employers' Liability Act, 1880, the sheriff-substitute found that the defenders were liable inasmuch as they had failed to appoint officials competent for the working of the mine, and he assessed the damages at 400l. On appeal the Court of Session held that the defenders were not liable at common law, having used reasonable care in appointing managers of the necessary qualifications and experience; that although there had been a breach of the special rules applicable to the mine under s. 49 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1887, these rules prescribed the duties of the managers and firemen and imposed no duties directly on the owners of the mine; but, secondly, that the defenders were liable under the Employers' Liability Act, 1880, in respect of the negligence of their servants and their failure to comply with the rules in question, and the Court awarded as damages 282l.:â€”

Held, reversing the decision of the Second Division of the Court of Session, that there was a duty on the defenders as owners of the mine to appoint and keep in charge persons competent to deal with the dangers arising in the mine; that they had not discharged this duty, and were therefore liable at common law for the sum awarded by the sheriff-substitute.

## Ratio

- If an incompetent person is employed or required to do a job that they are not capable of doing, then there will be a breach
- Whether or not a duty of care exists is a matter of law.
