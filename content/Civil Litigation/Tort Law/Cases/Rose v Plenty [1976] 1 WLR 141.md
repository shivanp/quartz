# Rose v Plenty [1976] 1 WLR 141

A boy was injured whilst assisting a milkman on his rounds; the boysâ€™ leg got trapped under the milk float. The milkman had been prohibited from enlisting help by his employer. Denning LJ held the employer vicariously liable on the basis that the prohibited act was done 'for the employer's business'. Scarman LJ, found the employer liable, following a more traditional analysis, that the prohibited act constituted an unauthorised mode of performing the task he was employed to carry out.
