## Abstract

A licensee lawfully invited onto premises by a servant does not become a trespasser vis-Ã -vis the employer unless a prohibition against his remaining upon the premises is known to him or communicated to him. The terms of T's employment by the company as manager of a public house prohibited T from allowing people to remain on the premises after normal closing time. In breach thereof, T allowed a party to continue after closing time and in leaving the party the deceased fell and was killed while descending an unlit staircase at about 1 a.m. There was no evidence that the deceased knew of the prohibition in T's terms of employment. Reeve, J. dismissed a claim by his widow against the company on the ground that although the deceased remained throughout a licensee, the company were not liable under the [Occupiers Liability Act 1957 s.2](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B605520E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=2ab327bd63954e738abe5a56aefa8b01&contextData=(sc.Default)) for acts committed by T wholly outside the scope of his employment.

Held, allowing the widow's appeal,

(1) that the deceased was a licensee at the time of the fall, no clear limitation of his licence to remain having been imposed;  
(2) that the company were liable for T's negligence in not ensuring the staircase was lit since the breach by T of the prohibition in the terms of his employment did not put his actions outside the scope of his employment but related only to his conduct within the sphere of his employment; and  
(3) that there were no grounds for interfering with the trial judge's apportionment of 50 per cent contributory negligence to the deceased.
