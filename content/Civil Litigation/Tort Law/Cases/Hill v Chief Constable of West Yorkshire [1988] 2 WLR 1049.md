# Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1988] 2 WLR 1049

## Abstract

Police officers do not owe a general duty of care to the public at large to apprehend unknown criminals, nor to individual members of the public unless such failure creates an exceptional additional risk and there is a proximity between the officers and the potential victim. H was the mother of the last of the victims of Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered some 13 young women in Yorkshire between 1975 and 1980. She contended that but for negligence by the West Yorkshire police, he would have been apprehended before her daughter had been murdered. H's claim was struck out.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that there is no general duty of care owed by the police to members of the public at large to apprehend an unknown criminal. In any event, as a matter of public policy, the police were immune from allegations of negligence arising from their investigation and suppression of crime.

## Facts

The plaintiff’s 20-year-old daughter was attacked at night in a city street and died from her injuries. The defendant was a chief constable of the area in which the street was located. The attacker was convicted of the murder of the daughter and had allegedly committed a number of offences of murder against young women in the same area over a period of years prior to the deceased’s murder. The plaintiff claimed damages against the defendant for negligence on grounds that having investigated the previous cases of murder in the area, the police had failed to apprehend the attacker and prevent the murder of her daughter. The Queen’s Bench struck out the writ and statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. The Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal.

## Issues

(1) Do the police owe a general duty of care to apprehend an unknown criminal?

(2) Do the police owe a duty of care to individual members of the public who suffer injuries as a result of the activity of the criminal?

## Decision/Outcome

The appeal was dismissed.

(1) The police could be liable in tort to persons who are injured as a direct result of their acts and omissions.

(2) However, the police do not owe a general duty of care to apprehend an unknown criminal.

(3) The police also do not owe a duty of care to individual members of the public who suffer as a result of the criminal’s activity.

(4) The only exception to this rule is where the failure to apprehend the criminal creates an exceptional added risk, different from the general risk from criminal activity to the public at large, so as to establish a sufficient proximity of relationship between the police officers and victims of crime.

The case was significant in setting the precedent for the general duty of care of the police to prevent crime and accidents.

The plaintiff's 20-year-old daughter was attacked at night in a city street of the police area of which the defendant was chief constable and died from her injuries. Her attacker, S., who was convicted of her murder, was alleged to have committed a series of offences of murder and attempted murder against young women in the area in similar circumstances over a period of years before the deceased's murder. The plaintiff claimed on behalf of her deceased daughter's estate damages against the defendant for negligence, in that in the conduct of investigations into the crimes which had been committed the police failed to apprehend S. and prevent the murder of her daughter. On the defendant's application, the judge ordered the striking out of the writ and statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. *54 The Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff's appeal against that order.

On the plaintiff's appeal:-

Held, dismissing the appeal, ( per Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton and Lord Goff of Chieveley) that, although police officers could be liable in tort to persons injured as a direct result of their acts or omissions, there was no general duty of care owed by them to identify or apprehend an unknown criminal, nor did they owe a duty of care to individual members of the public who might suffer injury through the criminal's activities save where their failure to apprehend him had created an exceptional added risk, different in incidence from the general risk to the public at large from criminal activities, so as to establish sufficient proximity of relationship between the police officers and the victims of the crime; that although it could have been reasonably foreseen that S., if not apprehended, would be likely to harm young female members of the public, the fact that the plaintiff's daughter had been young and female did not of itself place her at special risk and there being no other additional characteristics capable of establishing a duty of care owed towards her by the defendant in relation to the apprehension of S. the judge had been right to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action (post, pp. 62B-H,64A-B,65E,E-F).

Per Lord Templeman. The efficiency of a police force cannot be investigated by an action for damages but only by an inquiry instituted by the national or local authorities which are responsible to the electorate for that efficiency (post, p. 65B).
