# Latimer v AEC Ltd [1953] AC 643

The claimant worked in the defendant's factory and slipped up on the factory floor. The factory had become flooded due to adverse weather conditions. The defendant's had put up warning signs mopped up and placed 3 tonnes of sawdust in the most used places to make it as safe as possible. The trial judge held that there had been a breach of duty as the defendants should have closed the factory if it was unnsafe. However, no argument had been advanced on this.  

Held:  

  

There was no breach of duty. There was no duty to close the factory. The defendant only had to take reasonable precautions to minimise the risk which they had done. There was no need to go to great expense to eliminate any possible risk and thus no obligation to close the factory.

Facts

The defendant Mr Latimer, worked in a factory owned by the defendants, AEC Ltd. The factory had become flooded due to adverse weather, which caused the floor to become very slippery. In response, the defendants mopped up, put out warning signs for a slippery floor and placed sawdust on the floor to make the area as safe as possible for the workers. The complainant was working on nightshift after the flooding and when he was moving a heavy barrel, the slipperiness of the floor caused him to fall. He fell on his back and the barrel proceeded to crush his ankle.  
Issues

The trial judge had held that the defendants were in breach of their common law duty of care and were liable for damages. The defendants appealed this decision. The issues of this case surrounded the seriousness of the factory conditions and address the question; if all possible safety measures had been completed to protect workers, should the defendants have closed the factory down.

Decision/Outcome

The appeal was allowed. It was held that the defendants had not been negligent and they had taken all reasonable precautions that could have taken to minimise any possibility of risk to their employees. Thus, there was no breach of their duty of care and it was not reasonable to shut down the entire factory. This case states that an employer only had to take steps to minimise risk that a reasonable person would do in the circumstances.
