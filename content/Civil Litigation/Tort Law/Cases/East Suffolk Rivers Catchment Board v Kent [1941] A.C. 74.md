# East Suffolk Rivers Catchment Board v Kent [1941] A.C. 74

Where a statutory authority is entrusted with a mere power it cannot be made liable for any damage sustained by a member of the public by reason of a failure to exercise the power. If in the exercise of its discretion the authority embarks upon an execution of the power, the only duty owed to any member of the public is not thereby to add to the damages which that person would have suffered had the authority done nothing. So long as the authority exercises its discretion honestly, it can determine the method by which, and the time during which, the power shall be exercised; and it cannot be made liable, except to the extent just mentioned, for any damage that would have been avoided if it had exercised its discretion in a more reasonable way.

Owing to a very high tide a breach was made in a sea wall, as a consequence of which the respondents' land was flooded. The appellants in the exercise of their statutory powers undertook the repair of the wall, but carried out the work so inefficiently that the flooding continued for one hundred and seventy-eight days, thereby causing serious damage to the respondents' pasture land. It appeared from the evidence that by the exercise of reasonable skill the breach in the wall might have been repaired in fourteen days:-

Held, (Lord Atkin dissenting), that the appellants being under no obligation to repair the wall or to complete the work after having begun it, were under no liability to the respondents, the damage suffered by them being due to natural causes.
