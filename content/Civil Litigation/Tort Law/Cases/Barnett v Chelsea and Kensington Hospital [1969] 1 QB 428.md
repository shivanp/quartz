# Barnett v Chelsea and Kensington Hospital [1969] 1 QB 428

#key-case

The hospital breached the duty of care owed to a patient in that a doctor failed to carry out a proper examination. The patient died of arsenic poisoning after drinking poisoned tea. However, the evidence showed that he would have died even if the doctor had examined him. There was little or no chance that the antidote would have been administered to him on time even if he had been examined.

The claim failed on causation: but for the defendantâ€™s breach (failing to examine), would the claimant have died at that time and in that way? Yes. On the balance of probabilities, the claimant still would have died even if he had been examined by the doctor. Drinking the poisoned tea would have brought about his death whether or not he was treated by the doctor.

Introduced the 'but for' test - starting point for factual causation.

## Case Digest

A hospital authority which provides a casualty department owes a duty of care towards persons presenting themselves there complaining of illness. The deceased drank tea, which had, unknown to him, been contaminated with arsenic; he attended at the casualty department of a hospital complaining that he had been vomiting for three hours after drinking tea. The casualty doctor failed to examine him but sent a message that he should report to his own doctor. About five hours later he died. On his widow's action for damages, held,

(1) that the hospital authority owed a duty of care;  
(2) that the doctor was negligent in failing to examine and admit the deceased, and accordingly there had been a breach of that duty; but  
(3) that on the facts the deceased's condition was such that he must have died despite any medical attention which the hospital could have given, so that causation was not established and the claim failed.
