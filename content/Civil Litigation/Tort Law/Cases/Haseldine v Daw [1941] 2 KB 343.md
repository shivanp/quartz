# Haseldine v Daw [1941] 2 KB 343

The claimant visited a block of flats owned by the defendant in order to see one of the tenants. He was injured when the lift plummeted to the basement. The dropping of the lift was caused by the negligence of the highly reputable lift engineers.

It was held that the defendant had no responsibility as the work was technical and, therefore, reasonably entrusted to contractors; they were a competent firm; and the defendant, having no technical knowledge, could not be expected to carry out any checks on the machinery.
