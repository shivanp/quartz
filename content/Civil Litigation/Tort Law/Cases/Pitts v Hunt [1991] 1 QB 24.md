# Pitts v Hunt [1991] 1 QB 24

The claimant and defendant had been on a joint drinking spree and were both heavily intoxicated. The claimant rode pillion on the defendant's motorbike encouraging the defendant to drive recklessly. The claimant knew the defendant had no licence. Sadly, they were in an accident and the defendant died, and the claimant was injured. The defence of illegality was successful; the **claimantâ€™s injury was caused directly by the illegal act**, and it would have been an **affront to public conscience** to award the claimant damages.
