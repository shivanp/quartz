# Jan de Nul (UK) Ltd v Royale Belge SA [2002] EWCA Civ 209

## Summary

In circumstances where J had the benefit of insurance cover from RB in respect of dredging operations, an exclusion clause within the policy was only effective to exclude liability for damages recoverable solely in contract; the term "property damage" encompassed siltation of the waterway and the port conservators had a sufficient legal relationship with the waterway to justify recovery of the costs of silt removal.

## Abstract

A appealed against a ruling that it was liable to indemnify J in relation to the costs involved in clearing silt from Southampton Water resulting from J's nearby dredging operations. At first instance the court held that J was entitled to recover GBP 2.5 million, representing the costs of clearance under the terms of J's policy of third party insurance with A. A contended that

(1) the policy contained an exclusion clause effective to exclude liability for damage caused by the insured failing to fulfil their contractual obligations;  
(2) the policy did not offer an indemnity except in cases where there had been damage to property belonging to another and on the facts the only item capable of being described as property was the river bed which had not been damaged in any way, and  
(3) the conservators of the port, ABP, did not have a sufficient legal relationship with the property in question such as to constitute a relevant third party interest for the purposes of the policy.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that

(1) the exclusion clause was only effective to exclude claims for damages which were solely recoverable in contract. Since the claim made by J could have been founded in tort as well as in contract the exclusion clause was ineffective;  
(2) the waterway, consisting of the river bed, banks and the water itself, constituted the property and the deposit of silt which interfered with use of the waterway amounted to relevant property damage. The cost involved in removing the silt was accordingly recoverable, and  
(3) the policy did not respond except in circumstances where the insured was exposed to suit by a third party possessing some legal relationship with the property in question. In order to satisfy that criterion it was not necessary for the third party to be the owner or occupier of the property in question. The statutory responsibilities conferred upon ABP in relation to the property constituted a sufficient relationship in the instant case.
