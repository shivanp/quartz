# Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [2018] UKSC 4

## The Facts

Police officers approached a suspected drug dealer in a busy shopping street. The drug dealer resisted arrest, which led to a struggle. The police officers and the suspect collided with Mrs Robinson, knocked her over and fell on top of her. Mrs Robinson was injured and instituted proceedings against the Chief Constable on the grounds of the police officers’ negligence.

Crucially, Mrs Robinson’s case did not concern an omission – she did not allege that the police officers failed to protect her from the drug dealer. Rather, she argued that the police officers’ positive acts resulted in her injury. The key question for the Supreme Court was whether the police owed Mrs Robinson a duty of care in such circumstances.

## The Supreme Court

The Supreme Court unanimously held that the police did owe Mrs Robinson a duty of care, which had been breached. Lord Reed (with whom Lady Hale and Lord Hodge agreed) reached this conclusion through an application of the “established principles of the law of negligence” ([30]). Lord Hughes and Lord Mance agreed with the majority about the outcome, though their reasoning differed.

## Summary

It was important not to impose unrealistically demanding standards of care on police officers acting in the course of their operational duties, but officers did not have blanket immunity from suit in respect of their conduct in investigating or preventing crime. They were generally under a duty of care to avoid causing personal injuries where such a duty would arise under ordinary principles of negligence.

## Abstract

A pedestrian appealed against a decision that the police owed her no duty of care in respect of injuries sustained when a suspect tried to escape arrest in a busy town centre.

During a struggle, the suspect and two police officers had knocked the 76-year-old appellant to the ground and fallen on top of her. A recorder found the officers negligent, as they had foreseen that the suspect would try to escape arrest and the potential for harm to nearby individuals if he did, yet proceeded without noticing the appellant's nearby presence. He held, however, that _[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1989] A.C. 53, [1988] 4 WLUK 228](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC049A400E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d818b51117f4759adb23c3b8a7ad12c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ conferred an immunity on the officers from negligence claims. The Court of Appeal reversed the liability decision and held that the police owed no duty of care. It applied the test in _[Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605, [1990] 2 WLUK 128](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I821B84F0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d818b51117f4759adb23c3b8a7ad12c&contextData=(sc.Default))_, and indicated that most negligence claims for acts and omissions by the police in the course of investigating and preventing crime would fail the third stage of that test, namely whether it was fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty. It found also that the suspect, not the officers, was responsible for the harm, so that the case concerned an omission, rather than a positive act.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(Lord Mance and Lord Hughes dissenting on the reasons why a duty of care existed):

**Did the existence of a duty of care always depend on the application of the Caparo test?** No. Caparo repudiated the idea that there was a single test for determining the existence of a duty of care and urged an approach based on common law, precedent, and the incremental development of the law by analogy with established authorities, Caparo explained and _[Michael v Chief Constable of South Wales [2015] UKSC 2, [2015] A.C. 1732, [2015] 1 WLUK 622](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8376AC00A71211E48D9BFE15FEBA9566/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d818b51117f4759adb23c3b8a7ad12c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. Applying that approach, it had been established in many situations that no duty of care was owed. Only in novel cases, where established principles did not provide an answer, would courts need to go beyond established principles to decide whether to recognise a duty of care. In the instant case, the existence of a duty depended on the application of established principles of negligence, not on the Caparo test (see paras [21-30](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

**Was there a general rule that the police were under no duty of care when performing operational duties?** No. The Hill case continued to be misunderstood. The general law of tort applied to the police like anyone else. There were many authorities plainly inconsistent with any supposed rule that no duty of care was owed. They were not anomalous exceptions to a general absence of such a duty. Rather, they were examples of the application to the police of the ordinary common law duty to avoid causing reasonably foreseeable injury or damage. However, as noted in Michael, the general duty of the police to enforce the law did not carry with it a private law duty towards individuals. The common law did not normally impose liability for omissions, or, more particularly, for failure to prevent harm caused by third parties. Hill had therefore to be understood in the light of later authorities. It did not stand for the proposition that the police enjoyed a general immunity from suit. On the contrary, it expressly confirmed their liability for negligence where such liability would arise under ordinary tortious principles, Hill and _[Elguzouli-Daf v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1995] Q.B. 335, [1994] 11 WLUK 228](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA0D063C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d818b51117f4759adb23c3b8a7ad12c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ explained, _[Brooks v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [2005] UKHL 24, [2005] 1 W.L.R. 1495, [2005] 4 WLUK 503](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7BF25EF0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d818b51117f4759adb23c3b8a7ad12c&contextData=(sc.Default))_, _[Van Colle v Chief Constable of Hertfordshire [2008] UKHL 50, [2009] 1 A.C. 225, [2008] 7 WLUK 926](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID4F993F05EC411DDAB7DC9767090C799/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d818b51117f4759adb23c3b8a7ad12c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Desmond v Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire [2011] EWCA Civ 3, [2011] P.T.S.R. 1369, [2011] 1 WLUK 78](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB4F205101EA211E0A7ACF6424884DC90/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=0d818b51117f4759adb23c3b8a7ad12c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. Policy considerations in cases like Hill, Brooks and Van Colle should not be consigned to history, but were not a routine aspect of deciding negligence cases, and were unnecessary when existing legal principles provided a clear basis for a decision. Police officers might be under a duty of care to protect individuals from a danger of injury which they themselves had created, but had no duty to protect against dangers caused by the conduct of third parties (paras [44-48](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs"), paras [50-55](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs"), paras [58-70](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Did the case concern an omission or a positive act?** A positive act. The officers had acted carelessly in circumstances where it was foreseeable that carelessness would result in injury. It was not a case where they had played no active part in critical events (paras [72-73](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Did the police officers owe a duty of care to the appellant?** Yes. It had been reasonably foreseeable that the suspect might resist arrest, and the officers had foreseen it. The reasonably foreseeable risk of injury in attempting an arrest when pedestrians were close by was enough to create a duty of care (para.[74](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Had the Court of Appeal erred in overturning the recorder's negligence finding?** Yes. The finding was justified by the sole fact that the officers had failed to notice the appellant. However, the CA had been correct to emphasise the importance of not imposing unrealistically demanding standards of care on police officers discharging operational duties. The duty was always one of taking such care as was reasonable in the circumstances. Some circumstances might justify risking the safety of members of the public (paras [75-78](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Were the appellant's injuries caused by the officers' breach of their duty of care?** Yes. The chain of events had been initiated by the officers. A third party's voluntary act, particularly a criminal act, would often constitute a new intervening cause, but not when the act was the very one which the defendant was duty bound to guard against (paras [79-80](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
