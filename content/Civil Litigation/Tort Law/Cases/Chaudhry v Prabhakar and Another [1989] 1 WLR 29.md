# Chaudhry v Prabhakar and Another [1989] 1 WLR 29

The defendant advised his close friend (the claimant) on what second-hand car she should buy. The claimant had told the defendant that the car must not have been in an accident. The defendant was not a mechanic but was regarded by the claimant as knowing much more about cars than she did. The defendant found her a car. He realised the bonnet had been crumpled and straightened or replaced, but he did not ask the seller if it had been in an accident and told the claimant that it was in very good condition and that he highly recommended it.

He told her the seller was a friend (which he was not) and when she asked if the car had been in an accident, he said that it had not and that she need not have it examined by a mechanic. It turned out the car had been in an accident, was unroadworthy and worthless.

In an obiter comment (obiter because the defendant had admitted duty) the court indicated that they would have found a duty between the parties even though this was advice in a social setting. The defendant had more knowledge than the claimant about cars, and he held himself out as giving considered advice; he took time over the advice and the claimant made it very clear that she was relying on his advice and that it was of great importance to her. He had assumed responsibility for the claimant.
