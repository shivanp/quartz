# Tomlinson v Congleton [2003] UKHL 47

The 18-yearold claimant dived into the shallow water of a lake. He hit his head and sustained a serious injury. The House of Lords held that the risk of the claimant suffering injury had not arisen from any danger due to the state of the premises but from the claimantâ€™s activity of diving into shallow water.

It was made clear to the claimant that the lake was to be used for canoeing, fishing and windsurfing only. By swimming in the lake, Mr. Tomlinson was a trespasser, not a visitor.

## Summary

When considering, for the purposes of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, what steps, if any, an occupier of land should have taken to prevent an accident, the court should take into account the cost of taking the steps, the social value of the activities that the taking of the steps would prohibit and whether those of full capacity should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to take the relevant risk.

## Abstract

A local authority appealed against a decision ([2002] EWCA Civ 309, [2003] 2 W.L.R. 1120) that, as the owner and occupier of a country park, it had owed a duty of care to T pursuant to the [Occupiers' Liability Act 1984 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I659BE7C0E44A11DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d561422dced14e729ccbcb8ad9ba5ab5&contextData=(sc.Default)) and was liable for serious personal injuries that T had sustained when he dived into the shallow water at the edge of a lake and struck his head on the bottom. Swimming in the lake was prohibited, and the local authority had erected notices and distributed leaflets warning of the dangers of swimming in the lake. It was accepted that the relevant statutory duty was that owed to a trespasser under the 1984 Act and not the duty owed to a lawful visitor under the [Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 s.2(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I7B605520E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d561422dced14e729ccbcb8ad9ba5ab5&contextData=(sc.Default)) because, by virtue of the prohibition on swimming, when T had entered the water to swim he had become a trespasser.

T argued that the local authority had owed him a duty under s.1(4) of the 1984 Act to take such care as was reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that he did not suffer injury on the premises by reason of the danger concerned. Further, that that duty had not been discharged by the erection of notices because people had ignored those notices, which meant that they were obviously ineffectual.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the lake did not present risks due to the state of the premises or anything done or omitted to be done on the premises, pursuant to s.1(1)(a) of the 1984 Act. Accordingly, there was nothing which gave rise to a duty on the part of the local authority. Even if swimming had not been prohibited and the local authority had owed a duty under s.2(2) of the 1957 Act, it would not have been required to take steps to prevent T from diving or to warn him against dangers which were obvious, _[Donoghue v Folkestone Properties Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 231, [2003] Q.B. 1008, [2003] 2 WLUK 914](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I99FBE290E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d561422dced14e729ccbcb8ad9ba5ab5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Taylor v Glasgow City Council [1922] 1 A.C. 44, [1921] 11 WLUK 120](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICDF41080E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d561422dced14e729ccbcb8ad9ba5ab5&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. T was a person of full capacity who had voluntarily chosen to engage in an activity which had inherent dangers.
