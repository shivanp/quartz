# Mazhar Hussain v Chief Constable of West Mercia [2008] EWCA Civ 1205

## Summary

A claimant whose anxiety had manifested itself in physical symptoms of numbness to his arm and leg had not established that he had suffered material damage for the purpose of a claim for misfeasance in public office against a local police authority.

## Abstract

The appellant (H) appealed against a decision to strike out his claim against the respondent police authority for misfeasance in public office.

H had alleged that in the course of his trade as a taxi driver he had been involved in numerous incidents with the public for which he had called on police assistance. H alleged that the police authority had failed to deal with many matters properly and had subjected him to racially motivated hostility. Psychiatric evidence produced by H indicated that he did not have a psychiatric diagnosis but that he had experienced significant anxiety symptoms at times of stress including somatised physical symptoms of anxiety such as numbness and discomfort in his left arm and leg. The judge struck out his claim on the grounds that he could not establish that he had suffered damage or injury sufficient to constitute the tort of misfeasance in public office.

H submitted that he had suffered physical symptoms of anxiety, which was sufficient to amount to material damage.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) To amount to material damage there had to be a recognised psychiatric illness, not just distress or any other normal emotion, _[McLoughlin v O'Brian [1983] 1 A.C. 410, [1982] 5 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7E61740E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b06ca7fe57504e1384b5e35c772aea30&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Watkins v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 17, [2006] 2 A.C. 395, [2006] 3 WLUK 780](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF0AAA170E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=b06ca7fe57504e1384b5e35c772aea30&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. A recognised psychiatric illness was one that had been recognised by the psychiatric profession. In general, they were illnesses that were within the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems published by the World Health Organisation. H's medical evidence was that he did not have a psychiatric diagnosis. The numbness of his arm and leg were transient and were not a physical injury or damage so as to amount to material damage.

(2) (Obiter per Maurice Kay LJ) Whilst it was important to deny actionability where the non-physical consequences were trivial, it was important not to prevent a claimant who had the robustness to avert a recognised psychiatric illness but who nevertheless foreseeably suffered a grievous non-physical reaction as a consequence of the misfeasance. Lord Bingham in Watkins said that material damage included recognised psychiatric illness, not that it was limited to it as the only type of allowable non-physical injury. What Lord Bridge had been concerned to discount in O'Brien was normal human emotion, not significant abnormal manifestations of non-physical after effects.
