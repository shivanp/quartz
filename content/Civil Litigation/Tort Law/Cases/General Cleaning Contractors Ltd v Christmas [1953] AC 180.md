# General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v Christmas [1953] AC 180

Window cleaners working for the defendant, had developed a method of climbing onto the windowsills and holding onto the window frames while cleaning windows, instead of using ladders. Mr Christmas (a window cleaner) trapped his fingers in a sash window, let go and fell to the ground, suffering injury. He had not received any instructions, warnings or training in relation to sash windows. The employer was in breach. Employers were under a duty to go to the site of work, assess the risks, and **plan and organise a safe system for doing the work so as to minimise the risk of injury**. The provision of training, wedges or some other system to prevent the window frames from slipping should have been employed to make the job reasonably safe.
