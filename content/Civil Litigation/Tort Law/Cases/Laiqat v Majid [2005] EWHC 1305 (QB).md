# Laiqat v Majid [2005] EWHC 1305 (QB)

The defendant installed an extractor fan on their property that projected into the claimant’s garden by 750mm, at a height of 4.5m. The projection did not interfere with the claimant’s use of her garden. The court held that the fan was a permanent intrusion into the claimant’s airspace and constituted a trespass. It did not matter that it did not interfere with any normal activity conducted on the claimant’s garden. The law was clear that interference with airspace above another person’s land was trespass.
