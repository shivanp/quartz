# McGhee v National Coal Board [1973] 1 WLR 1 (HL)

#key-case

The claimant contracted dermatitis as a result of exposure to brick dust. The claimant worked with brick dust during his working hours and there was no breach in relation to this exposure (ie it was non-tortious). However, his employers were in breach of duty for failing to provide washing facilities for him to wash the brick dust off his skin at the end of the working day. As a result, the brick dust was on his skin for an extended amount of time including his cycle journey home.

Like in [[Bonnington Castings v Wardlaw [1956] AC 613]], the claimant would not have contracted dermatitis but for the exposure to dust. However, the medical experts could not state with certainty whether the dermatitis was caused by the exposure during the working day (non-tortious) or through the extended time that the dust remained on his skin (tortious). As a result, the 'but for' test could not be satisfied; the claimant could not prove on the balance of probabilities that but for the tortious dust he would not have suffered dermatitis.

The facts were therefore similar to Bonnington but with an important difference. In McGhee, medical evidence could not establish that dermatitis was a cumulative condition (ie it could not prove that the tortious and non-tortious dust operated together to cause the dermatitis). It could have been caused by a single exposure to the dust, so may have been caused by the non-tortious dust with the tortious dust making no contribution at all. Thus, the material contribution test could not be satisfied. The claimant could not show on the balance of probabilities that the tortious dust had made a more than negligible contribution.

However, what the medical experts could demonstrate was that the tortious exposure materially increased the risk of contracting dermatitis: the longer the dust was on the claimant's skin, the greater the risk of contracting dermatitis. The House of Lords therefore imposed liability on the defendant on the basis that their breach had materially increased the risk of the claimant's injury (the contribution to the risk must be greater than de minimus). This is arguably an easier test to satisfy than the material contribution test as the claimant does not even have to prove that the breach made any actual contribution to their loss, just that it increased the chances of the claimant suffering that loss. This is perhaps why this test is only applied in very limited situations.

## Abstract

It is actionable materially to increase the risk of another's injury, even if it cannot be proved that injury was definitely caused. P was employed by D on hot, dusty work. No washing facilities were provided, and P had to bicycle home from work caked with sweat and grime. Exertion under such conditions increased the risk of contracting dermatitis, and D was in breach of a duty in not providing showers. However, the mechanism of the disease was not clearly understood, and it could not be said that P would not have contracted the disease if showers had been provided, only that their absence increased the risk. P did contract the disease, and sued D.

Held, that causing the disease, and increasing the risk of contracting it by more than a negligible degree through breach of duty, had equivalent legal results.
