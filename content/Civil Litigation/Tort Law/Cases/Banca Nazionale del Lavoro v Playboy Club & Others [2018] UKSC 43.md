# Banca Nazionale del Lavoro v Playboy Club & Others [2018] UKSC 43

In this case, a wholly undisclosed principal could not rely on these Caparo principles to recover damages for losses suffered by it in reliance on a negligent credit reference made to its agent by the defendant bank, as it was neither identifiable, nor was the purpose known for which the credit reference was sought.

---

## Summary

A bank which provided a favourable reference for its customer to an agent was not liable in negligence to the undisclosed principal, a casino, for the fact that the customer was impecunious. The club's practice of using an agent to preserve its customers' confidentiality meant it was not just or reasonable to imply a proximate relationship.

## Abstract

A bank appealed against a decision (_[[2014] EWHC 2613 (QB), [2015] L.L.R. 171](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID42ECF50174411E4B9D6DB01801DFA6D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da625b3ed91e4b45972f0a4310b5f8db&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_) that it was liable in negligence for providing a bankers' reference for a customer (B) to an agent for the respondent club.

The club operated a casino and used an agent to preserve customer confidentiality. The bank had confirmed to the agent that B was financially sound and trustworthy for up to £1.6 million per week. On the strength of the reference the club exchanged B's cheques for gambling chips. B never held any money in the account, the cheques were returned as counterfeit, and the club lost around £800,000. The judge held that the bank owed a duty of care to the club of which it was in breach, and but for that breach the club would not have accepted the cheques. He found that the club was contributorily negligent to the extent of 15% since the cheques were photocopies and looked odd on their face.

The bank submitted that

(1) its duty of care extended only to the agent;  
(2) the scope of that duty did not include the customer's use of counterfeit cheques;  
(3) any claim should be reduced because of the contributory negligence of the club's employees.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(1) On the facts, the bank had assumed no responsibility to the club, _[Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman [1990] 2 A.C. 605, [1990] 2 WLUK 128](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I821B84F0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da625b3ed91e4b45972f0a4310b5f8db&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ and _[Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank Plc [2006] UKHL 28, [2007] 1 A.C. 181, [2006] 6 WLUK 476](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2E303BE0026F11DBBD1C8F45FD054A0D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da625b3ed91e4b45972f0a4310b5f8db&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ followed, _[Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] A.C. 465, [1963] 5 WLUK 95](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBC23A100E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da625b3ed91e4b45972f0a4310b5f8db&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ distinguished on the ground that the bank was only aware that the reference was for the agent and totally unaware, either of the club's existence, or that the purpose of the reference was for gambling. Further, any special relationship was between the bank and the agent alone. Given the club's standard practice of concealing its existence and asking for references in the name of its agent, it was not fair, just, or reasonable to impose liability on the bank (see paras [15, 19-25](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) The fact that the cheques were counterfeit and the bank would not accept them was only an interim problem, the real problem was that B was impecunious when the bank had represented that he was a man of wealth. It was quite different from cases where the problem was wholly extraneous to the defendants' negligence, _[NV Koninklijke Rotterdamsche Lloyd v Western Steamship Co Ltd (The Empire Jamaica) [1955] P. 259, [1955] 7 WLUK 36](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I1177F571E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da625b3ed91e4b45972f0a4310b5f8db&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ and _[South Australia Asset Management Corp v York Montague Ltd [1997] A.C. 191, [1996] 6 WLUK 227](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB6F1DDE0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=da625b3ed91e4b45972f0a4310b5f8db&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ distinguished, where the startling blunder in seamanship and the fall in the property market, respectively, were extraneous factors (paras [26-28](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) As no duty of care arose, the court declined to express an opinion on the issue of contributory negligence (para.[29](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
