# Bamford v Turnley (1862) 3 B&S 66

## **Facts:**

In Bamford v Turnley, the defendants had burnt some bricks and the noxious smoke affected their neighboursâ€™ health. Consequently, the neighbours sued on the grounds of nuisance.

## **Held:**

In conclusion, it was held that a landowner will not be liable in nuisance for the consequences of what would be recognised as a natural use of his land by him, unless the quality or extent of that use by him was unreasonable.

Also, the Court argued that the question to ask entirely depends on the surrounding circumstances. Therefore, how the alleged nuisance was committed, the time, place, the modes of acting or any other relevant surrounding facts. On the given facts of the present case, the defendants were liable to pay damages for nuisance.
