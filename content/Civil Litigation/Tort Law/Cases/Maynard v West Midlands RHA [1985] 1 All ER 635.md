# Maynard v West Midlands RHA [1985] 1 All ER 635

## Abstract

In the medical profession, as in others, there is room for differences of opinion and practice, and a court's preference for one body of opinion over another is no basis for a conclusion of negligence. M brought an action against the health authority for damages for negligence alleging that the decision to carry out an exploratory operation based on a mistaken diagnosis had been negligent.

At trial a distinguished body of expert medical opinion was called approving the health authority's action, but the judge said that he preferred the evidence of an expert called for M who said that a correct diagnosis should have been made at the outset and that it had been wrong and dangerous to undertake the operation. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the trial judge.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that in the medical profession, as in others, there was room for differences of opinion and practice, and a court's preference of one body of opinion to another was no basis for a conclusion of negligence; that when it was alleged that a fully considered decision by two consultants in their own special field had been negligent, it was not sufficient to establish negligence for the plaintiff to show that there was a body of competent professional opinion that considered that the decision had been wrong if there was also a body of professional opinion, equally competent, that supported the decision as having been reasonable in the circumstances (_[Whitehouse v Jordan [1981] 1 W.L.R. 246, [1980] 12 WLUK 181](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I000F0F70E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6beb5702069a4181af4f65c2db127508&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied and _[Joyce v Yeomans [1981] 1 W.L.R. 549, [1980] 12 WLUK 81](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID10E8C60E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6beb5702069a4181af4f65c2db127508&contextData=(sc.Search))_ applied).
