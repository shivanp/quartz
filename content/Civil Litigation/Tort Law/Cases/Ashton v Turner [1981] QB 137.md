# Ashton v Turner [1981] QB 137

## Abstract

In certain circumstances, for public policy reasons, the law may not recognise a duty of care owed by one participant in a criminal enterprise to another. After an evening's drinking three men committed a burglary and sought to escape in a car owned by one of them. The car crashed and the passenger was injured. He claimed damages alleging negligence against the driver and the car owner.

Held, dismissing the claim that  
(1) as a matter of public policy the law might not recognise a duty of care owed by one participant in a crime to another for acts done in the course of that commission;  
(2) "volenti" was a defence open to the driver. (_Godbolt v Fittock (1963) 63 S.R. (N.S.W.) 617_ and _[Smith v Jenkins (1970) 44 A.L.J.R. 78, [1970] 1 WLUK 17](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA0405AF0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f91d8b653c074d72987115213d9f5d11&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).
