# Edwards v Railways Executive [1952] AC 737

A spot on the railway was used as a shortcut on a regular basis. The fence was repaired whenever it was reported to have been damaged. However, it would be repeatedly beaten down by people wishing to use the railway as a shortcut. The fence was in good repair the day of the incident. The claimant was a nine-year-old boy who went to get his ball, which had gone through the fence. He was hit by a train. The court held that the claimant did not have implied permission, as the defendant had taken reasonable steps to prevent people using the railway as a shortcut (he was therefore a trespasser).

Before it can be inferred that a person has become a licensee to enter premises and to use them in a specific manner, there must be such assent to the user relied on as amounts to a licence to use the premises. Whether that result can be inferred or not must, of course, be a question of degree, but a court is not justified in lightly inferring it. The theory that mere knowledge of the intrusion of children into premises of itself constitutes the children licensees carries the doctrine of implied licence much too far.

Per Lord Oaksey:

> “In considering the question whether a licence can be inferred, the state of mind of the suggested licensee must be considered. The circumstances must be such that the suggested licensee could have thought, and did think, that he was not trespassing, but was on the property in question by the leave and licence of its owner.”

The appellant, a boy of nine, got through a fence dividing a recreation ground from a railway, the property of the respondents, climbed up the embankment, tripped on a rail and was injured by a train. Children had for many years climbed through the fence by breaking the wire to slide down the embankment. The respondents' servants had regularly repaired the fence. Held, even assuming that the respondents had knowledge of the intrusion of children on to the embankment, that knowledge did not constitute the children licensees; the respondents were not bound to take every possible step to keep intruders out, with the consequence that if they failed to do so a licence might be inferred; the appellant had failed to establish a licence, and, consequently, the appeal must be dismissed. _[Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) Ltd v Dumbreck [1929] A.C. 358, [1929] 2 WLUK 62](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I88A1C9A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a4b79c3f709f44328f56541ef96da759&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Cooke v Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland [1909] A.C. 229, [1909] 3 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8DB4BA20E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a4b79c3f709f44328f56541ef96da759&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished; and _[Lowery v Walker [1911] A.C. 10, [1910] 11 WLUK 47](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE7FBD770E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a4b79c3f709f44328f56541ef96da759&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished.
