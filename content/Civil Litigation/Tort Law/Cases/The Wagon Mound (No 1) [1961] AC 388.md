# The Wagon Mound (No 1) [1961] AC 388

The defendants negligently caused oil to spill into Sydney Harbour. The oil spread a distance of 600 feet into the vicinity of a ship called The Corrimal which was berthed at the claimant's wharf. Two days later welding operations on The Corrimal caused a spark to come into contact with debris floating on the oil. The flames from the debris set the oil on fire. The fire caused extensive damage to the claimant's premises. The damage was a direct result of the defendant's negligence, but the court had to determine whether the damage was too remote to be recoverable.

**HELD:** the damage was not reasonably foreseeable. Welders on the Corrimal had noticed the oil and sought expert advice before welding. They were told that there was no risk of fire given that the type of oil spilled required an extremely high ignition point to catch alight. Pollution damage was foreseeable, but fire damage was not. Accordingly, the loss was too remote, and the defendants were not liable for the fire damage.
