# Gough v Thorne [1966] 3 All ER 398

A lorry driver stopped and waved for the 13-year-old claimant to cross the road. As the claimant emerged from behind the lorry without looking, she was hit by the defendant driver. There was no contributory negligence as the claimant had met the standard of an ordinary 13-year-old. Had she been an adult, it is likely she would have been contributory negligent for not checking that anything was overtaking the lorry.
