# North Glamorgan NHS Trust v Walters [2002] EWCA Civ 1792

## Facts

N, an NHS trust, appealed against a decision granting damages to the claimant (C) for a psychiatric condition C suffered as a result of events which resulted in the death of her infant son (B). A hospital run by N had failed, negligently, to diagnose B's acute hepatitis, and as a result B suffered a seizure which was witnessed by C. The hospital initially informed C that B had suffered no brain damage, but it later transpired that B had incurred severe brain damage and would have no quality of life. C agreed to terminate life support, and B died in her arms. C brought an action against N for psychiatric damage, which was upheld, and N appealed on the basis that C was insufficiently proximate.

## Issue

Whether, in order to recover damages for psychiatric harm, the claimant must have witnessed a single traumatic event or its immediate aftermath, or whether, as was the case here, it would suffice that the event itself transpired over a period of hours, but the appreciation of the claimant was itself sudden. It was also argued by N that, as a matter of policy, to recognise liability in such circumstances would overextend the ambit of negligence with respect to psychiatric damage.

## Held

C was entitled to recover damages as a secondary victim. In such cases, the claimant must have witnessed a horrifying event or its immediate aftermath, as C had done. Such an event, moreover, was not limited to one moment in time; a realistic approach had to be taken in such cases, and on a realistic appraisal of the facts C had suffered nervous shock as a result of the sudden impact of being informed of Bâ€™s condition.

### Summary

Claimant's baby son admitted to hospital for tests - Tests inconclusive - Hospital gave wrong diagnosis - Transferred to another hospital - Diagnosed with severe brain damage and put on life support - Decision made to turn off life support - Hospital admitted negligence - Claimant successfully claimed for nervous shock - Judge reached correct decision - Thirty six hour period from discovering baby stiff to switching off life support one horrifying event - Claimant's appreciation of events sudden - Necessary proximity in space and time satisfied - No incremental step taken - No new application of principle - No requirement for public policy considerations to be invoked.

### Abstract

N, an NHS trust, appealed against a decision ([2002] EWHC 321, [2003] P.I.Q.R. P2) granting damages to W for a psychiatric condition, pathological grief reaction, suffered as a result of events leading to the death of her baby son, E. A hospital run by N had failed to diagnose E's acute hepatitis as a result of which he suffered a seizure witnessed by W. The hospital initially informed W that E had suffered no brain damage but, following his transfer and diagnosis at a second hospital, W was then told that E had been severely brain-damaged and would have no quality of life. W agreed to terminate life support and E died in her arms.

N contended that the judge below had erred in law by holding that the 36-hour period, from E's seizure to death, could be categorised as one horrifying event. N further suggested that W's appreciation of events had not been sudden, but rather amounted to a gradual assault of the mind over a period of time. N submitted that the judge's findings extended the established control mechanisms regulating damages for nervous shock and had paid insufficient regard to the recognised policy constraints in this area of law.

Held, dismissing the appeal, that W was entitled to damages as a secondary victim. In order for a nervous shock claim to be advanced the claimant must have witnessed a horrifying event or its immediate aftermath, _[McLoughlin v O'Brian [1983] 1 A.C. 410, [1982] 5 WLUK 23](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7E61740E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6e8b515bc250454486237e564c2ad76d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, _[Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1992] 1 A.C. 310, [1991] 11 WLUK 392](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I546B3320E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6e8b515bc250454486237e564c2ad76d&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. Such an event was not confined to one moment in time and, taking a realistic approach to the facts, the 36-hour period prior to E's death could be classed as a single horrifying event. The judge had also been justified in concluding that W's appreciation of events was sudden rather than gradual as the key events of witnessing the fit, being informed that E was brain-damaged and being told she should switch off the life support had made their devastating impact at the time of their occurrence. Given that W had suffered a sudden shock as a result of a single event, the judge's decision did not involve an extension of the principles of liability and therefore further policy considerations did not apply.
