# Christie v Davey [1893] 1 Ch 316

The parties lived next door to one another in a semi-detached house. Mrs Christie (the claimant) was a music teacher and throughout the day music pervaded the defendant’s house. This irritated the defendant who responded by making noise himself; beating trays, shouting and hitting the wall when the music was playing. The defendant’s noise was held to be excessive and unreasonable given that it was made deliberately and maliciously for the purpose of upsetting the claimant. It was not a legitimate use of the land. Mrs Christie was granted an injunction, restraining the defendant from creating any sounds in his house with the purpose of annoying the claimant.
