# Clifford v Charles Challen and Son Ltd [1951] 1 KB 495

The standard which the law requires of employers is that they should take reasonable care for the safety of their workmen. To discharge that duty properly an employer must make allowances for the imperfections of human nature. When he asks his men to work with dangerous substances, he must provide appliances to safeguard them, he must set in force a proper system by which they use the appliances and take the necessary precautions, and he must do his best to see that they adhere to it. He must remember that men doing a routine task are often heedless of their own safety and may become careless about taking precautions. He must, therefore, by his foreman, do his best to keep them up to the mark and not tolerate any slackness. He cannot throw all the blame on them if he has not shown a good example himself.

The plaintiff, a workman, contracted dermatitis, which was caused by his working with a synthetic glue while he was employed by the defendants sticking pieces of wood together. In 1943 H. M. Stationery Office had issued a notice about the danger of dermatitis from synthetic glue, which had been put up in government workshops. That notice had been read by the plaintiff in his previous employment. It recommended the precautions of applying "barrier cream" and washing the hands after using the glue. No barrier cream was kept in the defendants' shop, but workmen wishing to use it had to fetch it from a store. None of the workmen in the shop used the barrier cream, and the foreman observed that he was not a great believer in it himself. There was one bucket of water in the shop, and the workmen were at liberty to change the water in the bucket by going down a few steps and getting hot water from a boiler outside.

Held,  
(1) the defendants had been negligent, because they should have provided the barrier cream in the shop itself, and the foreman should have seen, as far as he could, that the workmen used it;  
(2) in view of the close proximity of the boiler, the trial Judge's finding that the defendants had not been negligent in not providing running water could be upheld;  
(3) the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence, because he knew that the glue was dangerous, and he knew what precautions ought to have been taken, but he did not take them; the fact that all the workmen in the shop were negligent could not exempt any one of them from responsibility for his own negligence;  
(4) the plaintiff and the defendants should share the responsibility equally.
