# Miller and Another v Jackson and Others [1977] QB 966

The defendant cricket club had been playing on its ground for more than 70 years when adjacent land was sold to developers to build a housing estate. Cricket balls were hit into the claimants’ garden. This amounted to a nuisance. The fact that the claimants moved to the nuisance was not a defence.

## Case Digest

The public interest, which requires young people to have the benefit of outdoor games, may be held to outweigh the private interest of neighbouring householders who are the victims of the balls therefrom, to prevent the grant of an injunction, even if the sportsmen are guilty of negligence. The L cricket club had played cricket on its ground since 1905. Developers of neighbouring land built a house for P in a position where, so long as cricket was played, there was a possibility of damage and injury. The club put their fence up to 15 feet (4.57 m) high, but still sixes sometimes landed in P's garden, so that P and Mrs. P found it impossible to use the garden when cricket was being played. P and Mrs. P were not fond of cricket. They claimed and were awarded damages for nuisance and an injunction to restrain the club from playing cricket on the ground without taking adequate steps to prevent balls from being hit onto their house or garden. On appeal, held, allowing the appeal, that (1) (Lord Denning M.R. dissenting), the L club was guilty of both nuisance and negligence, but (2) (Geoffrey Lane, L.J. dissenting), the court in exercising its equitable jurisdiction to grant an injunction must have regard to the public interest. The hardship to the public of losing the game should prevail over the hardship to the individual householders who could not use their garden whilst cricket was being played, and accordingly, the injunction would be discharged. (Bolton v Stone [1947-51] C.L.Y. 6789 and _[Sturges v Bridgman (1879) 11 Ch. D. 852, [1879] 7 WLUK 3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC623A320E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=1373bea38a5f444ab185e0cb5d56080e&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered).

### Facts

The plaintiffs in this case purchased a house in an estate which was adjacent to a functioning, in use, cricket field. The defendants in the case were members of the cricket club which used the field – Lintz Cricket Club. Cricket had been played in that field for over 70 years. After the plaintiffs moved into the property, cricket balls began to fly over the field’s protective barrier and into the plaintiffs property. The plaintiff complained, which caused Lintz Cricket Club to erect a chain link fence. This improved matters as fewer balls were now flying onto the plaintiff’s property, but it did not fully solve the issue as some still got through. The club offered the plaintiff to pay for any damage done or injuries received as a result of the balls landing onto the plaintiff land, including fixing any broken windows and similar. The plaintiff however refused all of the club’s offers. Instead, the plaintiff started this action, arguing nuisance and negligence, and attempting to obtain an injunction to prevent the club from playing cricket on their ground. The plaintiff argued that even though the club offered to make good any damage and that there had been no injuries, she was not able to use her garden when matches were being played for fear of being struck by a cricket ball.

### Issue

The issue in the case was whether the defendant cricket club members were guilty of nuisance and negligence, and whether they could successfully defend against such a claim by arguing that the plaintiff had willingly come to the nuisance.

### Decision/Outcome

The court held that the defendants were liable in both nuisance and negligence. Specifically, the court held that in the context of a claim of nuisance, it was no defence to argue that the plaintiff had come to the nuisance, as was established in **_Sturges v Bridgeman_** **[1879] 11 Ch D 852.** The court however refused to grant an injunction as it would be inequitable to do so in the context of the fact that cricket had been played on the grounds for over 70 years and preventing this now on behalf of the plaintiff would be to the detriment of the community.
