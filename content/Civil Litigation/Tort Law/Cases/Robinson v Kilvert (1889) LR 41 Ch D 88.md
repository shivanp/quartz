# Robinson v Kilvert (1889) LR 41 Ch D 88

The claimant operated a business in the same premises as the defendant, which involved storing heat sensitive paper. The defendant carried on a manufacturing business in the cellar of the building. The heat emitted from the defendant’s premises damaged the claimant’s paper. The court held that the claimant’s paper was abnormally sensitive and ordinary paper would have been unaffected. There was no nuisance and the defendant’s use of the land was reasonable.
