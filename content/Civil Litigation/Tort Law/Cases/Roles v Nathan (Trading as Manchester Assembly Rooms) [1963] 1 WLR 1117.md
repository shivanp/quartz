# Roles v Nathan (Trading as Manchester Assembly Rooms) [1963] 1 WLR 1117

 Chimney sweeps were called in by the defendant to come and clean out the flues of an old boiler. They tried to do their work on the chimney and flues without extinguishing the boiler. They were found dead in the chimney the next day having been killed by carbon monoxide gas. There was no liability, as this was a normal risk that the sweeps should have protected against. The sweeps should have known how to avoid this danger, as it was connected to their work and training. Ironically, the occupier had actually warned them of the risks before they started the job.
