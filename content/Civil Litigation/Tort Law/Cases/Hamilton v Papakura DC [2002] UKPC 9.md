# Hamilton v Papakura DC [2002] UKPC 9

## Summary

The duties to be imposed on statutory water suppliers did not extend beyond complying with drinking water standards; duties directed at fitness for the purpose for which the water was to be used, with no limit on that use, would be much too broad.

## Abstract

H appealed against a decision of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand ([2000] 1 N.Z.L.R. 265) upholding the dismissal of their claim for damages against P and W for the alleged damage caused to their cherry tomato crops by the hormone herbicide triclopyr, present in the town water supply.

H had purchased the water from P who had obtained it from W, the main bulk water supplier for the area. H had brought a claim in contract and negligence against P and in negligence and nuisance against W. They claimed that the spraying of gorse by W's contractors had contaminated a lake from which the water supply was obtained, and that it, in turn, had caused H's crops to be contaminated. The Court of Appeal rejected the claim on the basis that although the damage was caused by triclopyr contamination of the range of up to 10 parts per billion, 100 parts per billion was the maximum triclopyr permitted by the New Zealand Drinking Water Standards 1995.

H contended that  
(1) pursuant to the Sale of Goods Act 1908 (New Zealand) s.16(a), P had breached an implied term that the water it supplied was suitable for horticultural use in circumstances where H had relied upon P's skill and judgment;  
(2) P and W had breached their duty of care to supply water fit for the purposes for which it was intended, to monitor its quality and to notify them that the water might not be fit for its intended purpose, and  
(3) W were liable in nuisance and under Rylands v Fletcher given that it had brought a hormonal herbicide onto land, which if it escaped was likely to cause damage.

Held, dismissing the appeal (Lord Hutton and Lord Roger dissenting), that a local authority which complied with its statutory duty to provide drinking water to the requisite standard was not under an implied duty to meet the special requirements of individual users who required water of a higher quality for horticultural purposes.

Accordingly,  
(1) P's objective was to provide water fit for human use in accordance with the drinking water standards, and it had not breached those standards. It would not have occurred to P that H were relying on it to supply water of a higher quality, and there was no evidence that H ever thought that drinking water would not be suitable for their crops, _[Ashington Piggeries Ltd v Christopher Hill Ltd [1972] A.C. 441, [1971] 2 WLUK 123](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I67AD7790E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6b4f94fc5f65476292ef76ebda859ee8&contextData=(sc.DocLink))_ distinguished;  
(2) to impose such a duty on P and W as that contended for by H, would extend beyond the duty met by those authorities which supplied bulk water, a duty which had been founded on drinking water standards compiled from the World Health Organisation guidelines and established through consultation. Imposing a broader duty on suppliers would mean extra costs for general users. In addition, it had not been reasonably foreseeable to W or P that the water would damage H's tomato crop, and  
(3) although no longer contested by H, foreseeability was essential in order to establish liability under Rylands v Fletcher and nuisance.
