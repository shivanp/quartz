# Hedley Byrne v Heller [1964] AC 465

## Facts

The claimant advertising agency was asked to buy advertising space for Easipower Ltd. To ensure Easipower could pay for this service, before beginning the work, the claimant approached Easipower’s bank (the defendant) for a credit reference. The defendant bank assured the claimant in writing that Easipower was creditworthy. Relying on this advice, the claimant bought advertising space worth £17,000 for Easipower. It transpired that Easipower was not creditworthy. Easipower could not pay the claimant the £17,000, and so the claimant sued the defendant bank on the grounds that it had provided negligent advice, reasonably relied upon by the claimant, to its financial detriment. Included in the bank’s advice had been a disclaimer saying that the advice was prepared ‘without responsibility’.

## Held

Had it not been for the disclaimer, the bank would have owed a duty of care to the claimant for their pure economic loss (note: disclaimers must now be viewed in light of the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] and the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]], as discussed later in this element).

### Summary

In making a statement at the request of another, a duty of care would be owed by the representor to the inquirer if it was plain that in seeking information or advice from the representor the inquirer was reasonably trusting him to exercise such a degree of care as the circumstances required and the representor knew or ought to have known that the inquirer was doing so. If in those circumstances the representor gave information or advice which was negligent he would be liable for any pecuniary or personal damage caused to the inquirer, but where the representor had expressly excluded responsibility for reliance on his statement no liability arose.

### Abstract

The appellant company (H) appealed against the Court of Appeal's decision that it could not recover damages arising from moneys lost in reliance on the credit reference given by the respondent bank (X) in respect of one of X's customers (E).

H was an advertising agent who had placed substantial orders for advertising space for E, for which H was personally liable. H had then enquired of X as to the creditworthiness of E, and in reliance on the representations H refrained from cancelling the orders to relieve its personal liability. H became doubtful about the financial position of E, and it sought a further reference “without responsibility” from X. X's response to H, stated to be “for your private use and without responsibility on the part of the bank”, was that E was considered good for its ordinary business engagements. After that communication, H lost money when E went into liquidation.

H sought to recover the money lost by a claim in negligence against X. By authority binding upon them, both the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal considered themselves driven to the conclusion that no such action could lie in the absence of a contract or fiduciary relationship, and that no special relationship involving a duty of care could be inferred.

### Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) (Per Lord Reid) The principle in _[Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562, [1932] 5 WLUK 41](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I99FC57C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71a4dc4090fd45488aeb05e345a8084f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ had no direct bearing on the instant case. Donoghue set out to reflect the standards of the reasonable man, but reasonable people often stated opinions without taking care, so the law had to treat words and acts differently. It was clear that liability for negligent misstatement could not be founded on the Donoghue principle alone; something more was required, namely that the representor had expressly or impliedly undertaken responsibility for their statement, Donoghue considered. The decision in _[Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App. Cas. 337, [1889] 7 WLUK 3](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I985F4990E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71a4dc4090fd45488aeb05e345a8084f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ had not established any universal rule that, in the absence of any contract, an innocent (not fraudulent) but negligent misrepresentation could not give rise to an action, _[Nocton v Lord Ashburton [1914] A.C. 932, [1914] 6 WLUK 60](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0D8B51F0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71a4dc4090fd45488aeb05e345a8084f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied, Derry considered. In the light of the decision in _[Robinson v National Bank of Scotland Ltd 1916 S.C. (H.L.) 154, [1916] 4 WLUK 16](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I894A65B0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71a4dc4090fd45488aeb05e345a8084f&contextData=(sc.Default))_, concerning a duty of care arising from other “special relationships”, there was no logical stopping place short of all those relationships where the party seeking the advice was reasonably trusting the other to exercise such a degree of care as the circumstances required, and where the representor knew or should reasonably have known that the inquirer would rely on him, Robinson applied, _[Candler v Crane Christmas & Co [1951] 2 K.B. 164, [1950] 12 WLUK 72](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I81F6BEE0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71a4dc4090fd45488aeb05e345a8084f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled, _[Le Lievre v Gould [1893] 1 Q.B. 491, [1893] 2 WLUK 6](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ID805FEE0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71a4dc4090fd45488aeb05e345a8084f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ not followed and _[Cann v Willson (1888) 39 Ch. D. 39, [1888] 6 WLUK 21](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I81FC6430E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71a4dc4090fd45488aeb05e345a8084f&contextData=(sc.Default))_ approved. The relevant question in the instant case was whether an undertaking to assume a duty to take care could be inferred. Since H's inquiry had been requested “without responsibility” from X, it was clear that no such duty could be inferred.

(2) (Per Lord Morris) It should be regarded as settled that if someone possessed of a special skill undertook, irrespective of contract, to apply that skill for the assistance of another person who relied upon such skill, a duty of care should arise. That the service was given by words made no difference. Where a person was so placed that others could reasonably rely on his skill, and that person allowed his advice to be passed on to another whom he knew or should have known would rely on it, a duty of care also arose.

(3) (Per Lord Hodson) A banker giving references as to credit-worthiness was not under a legal obligation to do more than to give honest answers to the best of his actual knowledge. However, in accordance with Lord Morris, where a person gave advice in the knowledge that it would reasonably be relied upon, a duty of care arose.

(4) (Per Lord Devlin) The problem in issue was a by-product of the doctrine of consideration in English law. The special relationship required to establish a duty of care arose in relationships “equivalent to contract” where there was an assumption of responsibility which, but for the absence of consideration, would constitute a contract. The responsibility was not one implied by law, but one which was voluntarily accepted, either generally where a general relationship was created or specifically in relation to a particular transaction. Where there was a general relationship (such as that of solicitor/client, banker/customer, although there were others yet to be established) it was unnecessary to prove any more than its existence, and the duty followed. Where a particular relationship was created ad hoc (as in the instant case) the facts had to be examined to see if there was an express or implied undertaking of responsibility.

(5) (Per Lord Pearce) To import a duty of care, the relationship between the parties had normally to concern a business or professional transaction whose nature made clear the gravity of the inquiry.
