# Wheeler v JJ Saunders Ltd [1996] Ch 18

The defendant had planning permission to build two new pig sheds. One shed was 11 metres from the claimant’s holiday cottages. Strong smells emanated from the farm to the claimant’s property. Despite the planning permission, the Court of Appeal held the defendant liable in private nuisance. The planning permission had not changed the nature of the locality (it simply allowed the already existing pig farm to become bigger).
