# John v Central Manchester and Manchester Children's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust [2016] EWHC 407 (QB)

## Facts

The claimant claimed damages for brain injury arising from alleged clinical negligence. The alleged negligence concerned two periods of delay in the administration of urgent treatment. The claimant had fallen backwards down internal stairs leading to his flat. Two hours later he was found by a neighbour, slumped in vomit and unable to say anything intelligible. On arrival at hospital at 7am the doctor arranged for a CT scan. For various reasons, including a cancellation of the doctor's booking, the scan was performed six hours later at 1:15pm. That was the first period of delay.

The scan showed that the claimant required urgent neurosurgery. At 2pm it was arranged for him to be transferred to a different hospital. The ambulance was requested at 3pm. While waiting for the ambulance, the claimant had a seizure and lost consciousness. It took doctors 30 minutes to one hour to stabilise him. The ambulance was sent away and a second one requested about 5:30pm. It arrived at 6:40pm. This delay in transfer to the second hospital was the second period of delay.

Having undergone surgery at the second hospital, the claimant suffered a further seizure and developed an infection. He had further surgery to relieve inter-cranial pressure. He was left with permanent cognitive and neuropsychological impairment, preventing him from practising as a GP.

The claimant's case was that without the trust's two periods of delay, he would have avoided some or all of the inter-cranial pressure which materially contributed to the brain damage.

## Held (Judgement for claimant)

(1) Both periods of delay had been negligent.

(2) The "material contribution" (MC) test was the appropriate approach to causation. As this case was not an industrial disease case, material increase in risk was not relevant (this test was only applicable in single agency cases). The MC approach applied just as much to multiple factor cases, where causes were sequential or cumulative, as it did to "single agency" cases. Nowhere in _Bonnington_ was there a suggestion that MC was confined to single agency.

In this case it was not possible to attribute the brain damage to a specific cause. The potential causes were the initial trauma, an extended period of raised intracranial pressure and the post-operative infection. All of these factors were capable of contributing to his brain injury. It was not possible to separate out the relative contribution of the three factors. The MC test was therefore satisfied, and the claimant was awarded damages for the whole of his injury and loss.
