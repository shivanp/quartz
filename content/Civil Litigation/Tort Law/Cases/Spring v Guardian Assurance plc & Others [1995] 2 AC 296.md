# Spring v Guardian Assurance plc & Others [1995] 2 AC 296

The defendants gave a very disparaging job reference about the claimant. The claimant was unable to gain other employment in the life assurance industry as a result of the reference and, therefore, sued the defendant for negligence. There was no doubt that a referee owed a duty of care to the person requesting a reference (Hedley Byrne), but the House of Lords held that in addition there was a duty of care owed to the subject of the reference to provide an accurate reference. By giving a reference, the company assumed a responsibility to the claimant to exercise reasonable skill and care in the preparation of the reference. It is very difficult to get a job without a reference.
