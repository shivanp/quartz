# Cork v Kirby MacLean Ltd [1952] 2 All ER 402

## Facts

The claimant was a factory worker who died when he had an epileptic seizure while working on a platform with no railings over 20 feet above the ground. His employers were not aware of his condition, nor of the fact that his doctor had told him not to work at heights. The claimant’s partner sued the defendant employers in the tort of negligence.

## Issue

Establishing negligence involves proving that the defendant owed the claimant a duty of care, breached this duty of care, and that the breach caused the harm. It was clear in this case that a duty was owed and had been breached due to the absence of any railings. However, the defendant argued that the absence of railings did not cause his death, but rather the epilepsy did. As the defendant did not cause the epilepsy, they argued they did not cause the death.

The issue in this case was how causation is established in the tort of negligence.

## Decision / Outcome

The Court of Appeal held the defendant liable.

The Court set out the test for establishing causation. If the harm would not have occurred but for the breach of duty, the breach has caused the harm in the sense required by the tort of negligence. If the harm would have occurred anyway even if the defendant had not been in breach, the breach is not a cause of the harm.

In this case, had appropriate railings been installed, the claimant would not have not fallen off the platform while having the seizure. The defendant’s breach therefore caused the accident. The claimant’s damages were reduced to reflect his contributory negligence in failing to inform his employers of his condition, however.

# Case Digest

A workman, an epileptic, was set to work painting the roof inside a factory, which necessitated his doing the work from a platform some 23 feet above the floor of the factory. The platform was some 27 inches wide and was used for the deposit of the workman's bucket and brush. There were no guard-rails or toe-boards. The workman fell from the platform and was killed. The defendants, his employers, were unaware that he was subject to epileptic fits and that he was forbidden to work at heights.

His widow brought an action for damages in respect of his death against the defendants under the Fatal Accidents Act and the [Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60BEDB80E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13576aa3d519479fb4235bd38d2e33fe&contextData=(sc.Default)) . She alleged that her husband's death was caused by the defendants' breach of the Building (Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1948 reg.22(c) and reg.24 and by their negligence. The defendants denied liability, and alleged that while standing on the platform the workman had a fainting attack or epileptic fit which caused him to fall.

Held,  
(1) applying the provisions of s.1(1) of the [Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60B0F8D1E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13576aa3d519479fb4235bd38d2e33fe&contextData=(sc.Default)) the accident was partly due to the workman's own fault and partly to the fault of his employers;  
(2) a man who knew himself to be in the condition in which the workman knew that he was, ought to have told his employers;  
(3) however anxious he was to get work, he owed a duty to his employers and to his fellow workmen as well as to himself;  
(4) failure to inform the employers, followed by instructions from them to work at some height above ground, involved risk to other workmen and risk to the workman himself and constituted a "fault" within the definition in the [Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 s.4](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I49DB54A0E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13576aa3d519479fb4235bd38d2e33fe&contextData=(sc.Default)) and within the rational and ordinary meaning of the word in s.1;  
(5) Donovan J. must have been satisfied that the absence of a guard-rail was a cause of the death or else he would not have found for the plaintiff as he did;  
(6) both causes were operating together;  
(7) when the plaintiff was seeking to recover damages from the employers the employers might properly say that the workman was guilty of contributory negligence;  
(8) it was not possible to say that the responsibility for the damage was more on one side than it was on the other, which meant that the damages awarded to the plaintiff ought to be reduced by one-half. _Mist v Toleman & Sons [1946] 1 All E.R. 139, [1945] 12 WLUK 8_ applied; _[Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co 156 E.R. 1047, [1856] 2 WLUK 25](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF76B1960E57011DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13576aa3d519479fb4235bd38d2e33fe&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; and _[Nance v British Columbia Electric Railway Co Ltd [1951] A.C. 601, [1951] 6 WLUK 65](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0A3410A0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13576aa3d519479fb4235bd38d2e33fe&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied; _[Vyner v Waldenburg Bros Ltd [1946] K.B. 50, [1945] 7 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE7D67FB0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13576aa3d519479fb4235bd38d2e33fe&contextData=(sc.Default))_ explained; and _[Lee v Nursery Furnishings Ltd [1945] 1 All E.R. 387, [1945] 2 WLUK 18](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I122AF040E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=13576aa3d519479fb4235bd38d2e33fe&contextData=(sc.Default))_ explained).
