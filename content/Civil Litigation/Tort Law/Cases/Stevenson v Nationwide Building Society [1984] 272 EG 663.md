# Stevenson v Nationwide Building Society [1984] 272 EG 663

The claimant was an estate agent and insurance broker. He suffered pure economic loss by relying on a negligent survey given by the defendant in relation to a valuation of a property. Given his own expertise (he was an estate agent) the court held that he should have been aware of the need to obtain an independent structural survey, rather than simply relying on his lender’s (the defendant’s) valuation report. The claimant’s action failed.
