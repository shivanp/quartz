# Contributory negligence

## Definition

Once a tort has been established, it is for the defendant to prove a defence on the balance of probabilities.

Basis for contributory negligence: [s 1(1) of Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/8-9/28/section/1):

> Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage.

So defence must establish ([[Jones v Livox Quarries [1952] 2 QB 608]]):

1. Claimant failed to take reasonable steps for their own safety
2. This failure contributed to claimant's damage

## Partial Defence

Finding of contributory negligence reduces the liability of a defendant in relation to the harm their breach of duty has caused the claimant. Practically, means claimant's damages reduced by percentage the court thinks is just and equitable, having regard to claimant's share in responsibility.

## Stages

### Failure to Take Reasonable Steps for Safety

Claimant required to take the same degree of care that a reasonable and prudent person would take (objective standard).

Cases:

- [[Owens v Brimmell [1977] QB 859]]: a passenger is guilty of contributory negligence where they knew the driver had consumed excessive alcohol, or they had gone drinking with the driver knowing they would later lose the [[capacity]] to appreciate the danger of being a passenger.
- [[Sayers v Harlow UDC [1958] 1 WLR 623]]: claimant failure to take reasonable care while trying to escape toilet cubicle.
- [[Jones v Livox Quarries [1952] 2 QB 608]]

Allowances made for claimants placed in emergencies/ difficult dilemmas, e.g. [[Jones v Boyce (1816) 1 Stark 493]].

Where the claimant is a child, the court will take into account their age when determining expected standard of care: [[Gough v Thorne [1966] 3 All ER 398]].

Rescuers generally protected from contributory negligence: [[Baker v T.E. Hopkins & Son Ltd [1959] 3 All ER 225]].

But in [[Harrison v BRB [1981] 3 All ER 679]] the court felt that such protection would not be justified if the rescuer had negligently helped to create the emergency in the first place.

The nature of the duty must also be considered: [[St George v Home Office [2008] EWCA Civ 1068]]

### Failure Contributed to Claimant's Damage

Claimant's fault must contribute to damage suffered, though it need not contribute to the accident. So failure to wear a seatbelt is contributory negligent if wearing the seatbelt would have reduced/ avoided injury ([[Froom v Butcher [1976] QB 286]]).

## Deduction Made

The court has discretion as to the reduction to award. Claimant's degree of culpability will be expressed in percentage terms. The court tries to be 'just and equitable'.

If there are several defendants, the court must first determine whether claimant's claim against the defendants as a whole should be reduced. Then, liability sharing between defendants can be determined ([[Fitzgerald v Lane [1989] AC 328]]).
