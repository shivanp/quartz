# Establishing breach of duty

A question of facts, requiring consideration of particular circumstances of the case. But there are some general guiding principles for determining whether the defendant is at fault.

## Likelihood of Harm

For likely someone is to get injured, the more likely it is that there will be a [[breach]].

- In [[Bolton v Stone [1951] AC 850]] claimant injured by cricket ball hit out of ground, but so unlikely that held there was no breach.
- In [[Haley v London Electricity Board [1965] AC 778]] defendant had not taken protections to prevent blind people, which was a breach.

## Magnitude of Harm

If injury that may occur would be serious, greater care needed.

- In [[Paris v Stepney Borough Council [1951] AC 367]] the defendant was held liable because the consequence of injury (loss of sight) was very high for the claimant, given that he only had one good eye
- In [[Watson v British Boxing Board of Control Ltd [2001] QB 1134]] liability was imposed on the regulating body because it failed to provide suitable ringside resuscitation equipment and doctors, given that the potential harm was so high

N.B. Generally cite *Bolton* and *Watson* in essays:

> The more likely someone is to get injured, the more likely there has been a breach (*Bolton v Stone*).  
> The more serious the reasonably foreseeable damage, the more the defendant has to do to show that they have met the standard of a reasonable person (*Watson v BBBC*)

## Practicality of Precautions

Balancing cost and practicality of precautions against the severity of the risk. If it were unreasonable to ask defendant to take all necessary precautions, even against clearly foreseeable risk, no liability would be imposed.

In [[Latimer v AEC Ltd [1953] AC 643]] reasonable precautions were held to have been made.

The courts are also reluctant to interfere with

## Benefit of the Defendant's Conduct

Policy consideration: the value to society of defendant's activity is a factor for courts to consider. If defendant took risk with the aim of preserving/ protecting life, limb or property, then may be justified.

- In [[Watt v Hertfordshire County Council [1954] 1 WLR 835]] no breach by the fireman's employer since the ultimate aim of saving life justified taking of risk.
- But a fire authority was held liable for damage after going through a red light in [[Ward v London County Council [1938] 2 All ER 341]].

### Compensation Act 2006 S 1

Allows the courts to consider the deterrent effect of potential liability on socially desirable activities. So whether a requirement to take certain steps (precautions or otherwise) might:

- Prevent a desirable activity from being undertaken at all
- Discourage persons from undertaking functions in connection with a desirable activity.

### Social Action, Responsibility and Heroism Act 2015 (SARAH)

When a court is considering whether a person has been negligent, must take into account

- whether they were acting for the benefit of society or any of its members
- whether the person demonstrated a predominantly responsible approach to protecting the safety/ other interests of others
- Whether the negligence or breach of statutory duty occurred when the person was acting heroically by intervening in an emergency to assist an individual in danger

Note, lots of people hate this bill, say it's useless, 'not so much a bad Bill as a sad Bill'. Makes 'heroism' — whatever that is — relevant to whether an individual is negligent.

## Common Practice

If defendant shows they acted in accordance with practice usually followed by others in the field, might be able to escape liability. But the court might rule common practice itself is negligent. Te less expertise/ specialist knowledge involved in a particular area, the less weight the court will give to 'common practice' as a consideration.

[[Re Herald of Free Enterprise]] (sailing with bow doors upon, courts found this utterly negligent)

## “State Of the art” Defence

Relevant to establish whether there has been a breach. Assesses defendant's actions against knowledge in the profession and/or accepted practice at the time of the breach. See [[Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 QB 66]].

### Application to a Professional Context

- Back in 1953, deemed impractical and unrealistic to expect a professional to know every new development in their field at any moment in time ([[Crawford v Charing Cross Hospital, The Times, 8 December 1953]])
- But more recently changes. GMC says doctors must do what is reasonable to keep up to date with new developments, by going on professional development courses
- [[Gascoine v Sheridan [1994] 5 Med LR 437]]: doctors must follow changes recognised in mainstream literature, but not necessarily those in more obscure journals.

## Sport

When defendant is participating in sport, likely to take risks in the heat of the moment ([[Wooldridge v Sumner [1963] 2 QB 43]]). It was held in this case that nothing short of reckless disregard for claimant's safety would constitute a breach.

In [[Watson v Gray, The Times, 26 November 1998]] breach of duty, since the reasonable participant at defendant's level would have known there was a significant risk that what they did would result in serious injury.

## Proof of Breach

Likelihood of harm must be weighed against the practicality of precautions when assessing breach ([[The Wagon Mound (No 2) [1967] 1 AC 617]]).

The burden is on the claimant to prove that the defendant breached the duty of care. This must be shown on the balance of probabilities.

### Section 11 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968

says that if the claimant's injury led to a criminal prosecution being brought against the defendant, then the claimant may be helped by relying on any conviction that results, if the conviction is evidence of careless conduct.

### Res Ipsa Loquitur

> "The facts speak for themselves"

In v small no. of cases, claimant can use the argument that the only plausible explanation for the claimant's injuries is negligence by the defendant. If this applies, will be for the defendant to prove that they were not negligent. So helps claimants who have difficulty proving exactly how an accident occurred.

In [[Scott v London and St Katherine Docks & Co (1865) 3 H&C 596]] defendant could not explain how large sacks of sugar fell on her: must be because of carelessness.

Conditions for applying maxim:

1. Thing causing damage under the control of the defendant/ someone they are responsible for
2. Accident would not normally happen without negligence
3. Cause of accident unknown to claimant.
