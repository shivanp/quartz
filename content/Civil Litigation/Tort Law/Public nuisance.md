# Public nuisance

## Definition

> ‘…acts or omissions of the defendant that materially affect the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty’s subjects.’  
> [[Attorney General v PYA Quarries [1957] 2 QB 169]]

Public nuisance is a **crime**. Very occasionally, however, it may also be a tort where the harm suffered is by a section of the community or the community as a whole.

Many areas of public nuisance, such as pollution, noise and public health measures, have now become regulated by statute and statutory regulations. As a result, public nuisance is now a residual method of dealing with certain interferences that cannot be dealt with by other means or where an individual wishes to claim common law damages.

## Suing

### Who Can Sue in Public Nuisance?

1. An individual
2. A local authority: can sue on its own behalf, or in its name to protect the inhabitants of its area
3. The Attorney General: can sue where a class of people are affected by the public nuisance and no individual action is possible or forthcoming

### When Can an Individual Sue in Public Negligence?

An individual can only sue in public negligence in limited circumstances, where they can show that they have suffered 'special damage' ([[Ricket v Metropolitan Railway (1867) LR 2 HL 175]]). This means the claimant has suffered over and above the rest of the class (and there is therefore a class in the first place), or in a way that is different in kind from the rest of the class.

Such special damage must be **direct and substantial** ([[Colour Quest Ltd v Total Downstream UK Plc [2010] EWCA Civ 180]]).

 

Example: [[Lyons Sons & Co v Gulliver [1914] 1 Ch 631]]

### Who Can Be Sued in Public Negligence?

Little judicial debate over the issue of who may be sued; the tortfeasor is usually easily identifiable. This is usually the creator of the nuisance, or any person 'responsible' for the nuisance.

### What Losses Are Recoverable?

Property damage, consequential economic loss, personal injury, pure economic loss, and inconvenience.

## Elements

Elements to consider are:

1. Act or omission
	- Liability can exist for omissions as well as acts, meaning it can be advantageous to sue in public nuisance rather than negligence for an omission.
2. One-off event or continuous
	- Unlike private nuisance, a public nuisance can be a one-off/ isolated event
3. Class of Her Majesty's subjects
	- The effect of nuisance must be sufficiently widespread, no exact number of people who need to be affected to constitute a class. This depends on the facts of the case [[Attorney General v PYA Quarries [1957] 2 QB 169]]
	- Not necessary that every member of the class has been affected
	- A class refers to a ‘section of the public’ or ‘the community’ or ‘a significant section of the community’ ([[R v Rimmington [2005] UKHL 63]]). A class had to suffer a 'common injury', i.e., be affected at more or less the **same time and in the same location**.
4. Materially affects comfort and convenience
	- Damage that is recoverable in public nuisance includes property damage and consequential economic loss
	- Damages for personal injury, and for pure economic loss, can also be recovered.
	- The claimant can also claim for 'inconvenience', but this may be material, i.e., more than trivial ([[Jan de Nul (UK) Ltd v Royale Belge SA [2002] EWCA Civ 209]]). There is no need to be actual damage; annoyance or irritation will be sufficient so long as this is material ([[Benjamin v Storr (1873) LR 9 CP 400]]).
	- The type of loss must be reasonably foreseeable ([[The Wagon Mound (No 2) [1967] 1 AC 617]])

## Defences

The same defences apply as for private nuisance, except for prescription. The main defence is that of statutory authority.

## Remedies

Injunctions and/or damages are available, as for private nuisance. If the claim is brought by the local authority or Attorney General, the only remedy available is an injunction.

- [[Wandsworth London Borough Council v Railtrack plc [2001] All ER (D) 410]]
- [[Castle v St Augustine’s Link (1922) 38 TLR 615]]
