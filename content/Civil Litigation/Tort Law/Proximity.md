# Proximity

Significant feature of many cases. A clear guiding principle is that there is assumed to be proximity where a defendant assumes responsibility for a claimant.

Though language of proximity was used in [[Anns v Merton London Borough Council [1978] AC 728]] and [[Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562]], was not intended to add anything to the notion that it was reasonably foreseeable that the claimant might be harmed by the defendant's carelessness. But under Caparo this definition was changed.

Proximity is not so much a definable concept as a label for a description of circumstances under which pragmatically courts conclude that duty of care exists.

> Shorthand for a relationship between two parties which makes it fair and reasonable that one should owe the other a duty of care.  
> (Lord Nicholls, 1996)

In order for there to be a duty of care under Caparo, there needs to be sufficient proximity between defendant and claimant or sufficient proximity between defendant and third party.

Proximity concerns the degree of connection between the parties and whether a duty ought to be imposed on the tortfeasor bearing in mind his connection to the victim. Good example: [[Bourhill v Young [1943] AC 92]]; Ms Bourhill was held not to have been "proximate to the negligence because it was not foreseeable to the motorcyclist that she, on the other side of the road, might suffer bodily harm arising out of his negligent driving".

## Sufficient Proximity Between Defendant and Claimant

What amounts to sufficient proximity considered in the following case law:

- In [[Stansbie v Troman [1948] 2 KB 48]], sufficient proximity because of the contractual relationship between parties.
- In [[Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd [1970] AC 1004]], a duty of care was owed by the Home Office to the claimant because the claimants were identifiable victims at particular risk of damage over and above the public at large.
- In [[Swinney v Chief Constable of Northumbria Police Force [1997] QB 464]] the police had assumed responsibility to protect the claimant against a criminal she gave evidence against, which constituted a duty of care.
- In [[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1988] 2 WLR 1049]] no duty of care was owed since the victim was an unidentifiable member of a massive group.
- It was shown in [[ Mitchell v Glasgow City Council [2009] UKHL 11]] that being an identifiable victim is not enough; the defendant must also through their words and conduct assume responsibility for the claimant. Supported in case of [[CN and GN v Poole Borough Council [2019] UKSC 25]].
- Where there is exceptional proximity between the claimant and defendant, liability can be imposed even for omissions ([[Phelps v Hillingdon London Borough (2000) 3 WLR 776]]).

## Sufficient Proximity Between Defendant and Third Party

Duty imposed on the basis that the defendant has a responsibility to control/ supervise third party. Relevant case law:

- In [[Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd [1970] AC 1004]], there was a supervisory relationship between the borstal boys and the defendant, leading to a duty of care.
- In [[Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire [1988] 2 WLR 1049]] no proximity between defendant and third party, as Peter Sutcliffe not under police care at time of killing, so no duty of care owed.
- In [[Palmer v Tees Health Authority [1999] EWCA Civ 1533]] it was established that there was not sufficient proximity between the authority and patient since the patient was not under the authority's care and control at the time of the harm being committed. Moreover, the victim was not a member of an identifiable at risk group.
