# Liability for acts of third parties

## General Rule

Law of tort only imposes liability on those who directly cause injury or damage to another; no such duty is imposed on failure to prevent third party causing harm to another ([[Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987] AC 241]]).

## Exceptions

Exception | Details
---|---
[[Proximity#Sufficient proximity between defendant and claimant]] | The claimant comes within a narrowly defined class of potential victims/ defendant voluntarily assumed responsibility for the claimant.
[[Proximity#Sufficient proximity between defendant and third party]] | Strong relationship of control between the defendant and third party. Defendant assumed responsibility for the third party's actions.
Defendant created danger | In [[Stansbie v Troman [1948] 2 KB 48]] decorator created danger by failing to secure the building, so owed a duty of care.
Failure to take reasonable steps to abate a known danger created by a third party on defendant's premises | If defendant knows, or ought to know, of danger on their property created by third party, may owe a duty to anyone subsequently damaged as a result of the said danger. In [[Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987] AC 241]] no duty was owed by Littlewoods since they did not know of the danger, nor was it foreseeable.

These exceptions can be categorised in different ways. In [[Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police [2018] UKSC 4]], court aproved the following circumstances in which A holds a duty to B in relation to harm caused by a third party:

1. A has assumed responsibility to protect B from that danger
2. A has done something which prevents another from protecting B from that danger
3. A has a special level of control over source of danger
4. A's status creates obligation to protect B from that danger.
