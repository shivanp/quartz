# The Albazero [1976] 3 All ER 129

Where goods shipped in a chartered vessel under a bill of lading issued by the ship-owners are lost or damaged as a result of conduct which constituted a breach of the charterparty by the ship-owner, charterers who have transferred the property in the cargo to the indorsees of the bill of lading cannot recover as damages in an action against the ship-owner the full value of the goods lost or damaged.

P Co. chartered the Albacruz (A), which was owned by D Co. They shipped a cargo of crude oil on board for carriage from Venezuela to Antwerp. Carriage was covered by a bill of lading issued pursuant to the charterparty naming the plaintiffs as consignees and the goods as deliverable to their order. In the course of the voyage, the A and her cargo became a total loss owing to breaches by the shipowners of the charterparty. On a day prior to the loss, P's agents had indorsed the bill of lading to an Antwerp company and posted it to them. It arrived the day after the loss. P Co. brought an action against D Co. for damages, and arrested the A, which was also owned by D Co.

Held, that

(1) in the circumstances of the case, property in and the right to possession of the cargo had passed to the indorsees of the bill of lading at the time of the loss;

(2) the rationale of Dunlop v Lambert 7 E.R. 824, [1839] 7 WLUK 81 could no longer apply in cases where the only contract of carriage into which the shipowner entered was that contained in the bill of lading and the goods passed to the consignee or indorsee named in the bill by reason of the consignment or indorsement, since the right of suit against the shipowner in respect of obligation arising under the contract thereupon passed to him from the consignor.

(1) The general principle of English law that, apart from nominal damages, a party to a contract can only recover in an action for breach of contract the actual loss he has himself sustained, is subject to an exception in the case of a commercial contract concerning goods where it is in the contemplation of the parties that the proprietary interest in the goods might be transferred from one owner to another after the contract has been entered into and before the breach which causes loss or damage to the goods.

In such a case an original party to the contract, if such is the intention of both parties, is to be treated in law as having entered into the contract for the benefit of all persons who have or who might acquire an interest in the goods before they are lost or damaged, and is entitled to recover, by way of damages for breach of contract, the actual loss sustained by those for whose benefit the contract has been entered into;

(2) that exception cannot, however, be extended to a contract for the carriage of goods which contemplates that the carrier will also enter into separate contracts of carriage with whomsoever might become the owner of goods carried pursuant to the original contract. A charterparty which provides for the issue of bills of lading covering the carriage of particular goods shipped on the chartered vessel is such a contract, whether it is a voyage or a time charter. It follows therefore that the charterers are not entitled to recover substantial damages for the loss of the goods.
