# Shanklin Pier v Detel Products Ltd [1951] 2 KB 854

## Facts

Shanklin Pier employed contractors to paint the pier. It was a term of the contract that Shanklin Pier was to specify the paint to be used. Detel informed Shanklin Pier that their paint would last for at least seven years. Shanklin Pier instructed the contractors to buy and use Detelâ€™s paint. The paint lasted three months. Shanklin Pier sued for breach of contract. However, the contract was between Shanklin Pier and the contractors.

## Held

Mr Justice McNair held that there was a collateral contract between Shanklin Pier and Detel, the consideration for which was, on the one hand, the warranty by Detel that the paint would last for seven years and on the other, the instruction by Shanklin Pier to the contractors to buy the paint.

This shows that if the court can establish the existence of a separate collateral contract between the promisor and the third party, it can avoid the difficulties of privity. It should be noted that the promisor and the third party had communicated with each other, and also that the court found consideration for the bargain between them.
