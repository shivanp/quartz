# Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158

## Case Digest

Damages for fraudulent misrepresentation are completely at large and extend to the limit of the loss actually suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the misrepresentation.

Per curiam: wherever it can do so without injustice to the other party, the Court of Appeal will not allow a party to be prejudiced by errors on the part of his counsel at the trial. The plaintiff purchased an ironmongers' business from X. He did so on the strength of X's representations:

(a) as to the size of the weekly wages bill and  
(b) that all the trade was conducted from the shop.

In fact, both representations were false to the knowledge of X inasmuch as a part-time traveller was employed whose wages were not disclosed to the plaintiff and by whom half the trade of the business was conducted (i.e., outside the shop). The plaintiff sued for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and for conspiracy. He succeeded, and on his counsel's submission the judge awarded GBP 1,500 damages, this sum being based on the cost of the services of a part-time traveller.

On appeal by the plaintiff, held, allowing the appeal,  
(1) that the damages awarded had been calculated, erroneously, on the basis that they were damages for breach of contract;  
(2) that the damages ought to extend to the whole of the plaintiff's loss; and  
(3) that, on the facts, the sum of GBP 5,500 would be awarded.
