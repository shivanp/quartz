# Huyton SA v Peter Cremer GmbH & Co [1999] 1 Lloyd's Rep 620

Mance J:

> "The minimum basic test of subjective causation in economic duress ought, it appears to me, to be a “but for” test. The illegitimate pressure must have been such as actually caused the making of the agreement, in the sense that it would not otherwise have been made either at all or, at least, in the terms in which it was made. In that sense, the pressure must have been decisive or clinching (at p. 636)"
