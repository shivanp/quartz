# Hannigan v Hannigan [2000] 2 FCR 650

The Court of Appeal was faced with a claim that should have been started under Part 8 using Form N208, but in fact it was commenced on a pre-CPR form with the same number. The defendants sought to strike out the claim. The claimant conceded eight failings, namely:  
(a) the claim was issued on the wrong form;  
(b) the statement of case was not verified by a statement of truth;  
(c) there was a failure to include the Royal Coat of Arms;  
(d) the first defendant was incorrectly named;  
(e) Mrs Hannigan’s witness statement was signed in the name of her firm rather than by her  
personally;  
(f ) her witness statement did not have the requisite legend in the top right-hand corner;  
(g) her witness statement failed to have marginal notes or a 3.5cm margin; and  
(h) the exhibit to her witness statement failed to have the requisite legend in the top righthand corner, or a front page setting out a list of the documents and the dates of all the exhibits. It also failed to have the documents paginated.

The district judge said that the proceedings were ‘fundamentally flawed’ and the circuit judge held that ‘there is too much wrong with these proceedings to exercise a discretion in the appellants’ favour’. However, the Court of Appeal refused to strike out the claim, Brooke LJ explaining:

> [36] … The interests of the administration of justice would have been much better served if the defendants’ solicitors had simply pointed out all the mistakes that had been made in these very early days of the new rules and Mrs Hannigan’s solicitor had corrected them all quickly and agreed to indemnify both parties for all the expense unnecessarily caused by his incompetence. CPR 1.3 provides that the parties are required to help the court to further the overriding objective, and the overriding objective is not furthered by arid squabbles about technicalities such as have disfigured this litigation and eaten into the quite slender resources available to the parties.
