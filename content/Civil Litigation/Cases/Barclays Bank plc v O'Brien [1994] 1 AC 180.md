# Barclays Bank plc v O'Brien [1994] 1 AC 180

Mr O'Brien was a shareholder in a company and wanted to increase the overdraft facility of the company in question. The company's bank agreed a loan of £12,000 that was to be guaranteed by Mr O'Brien, his liability in turn being secured by a second charge over the matrimonial home, which was jointly owned by Mr O'Brien and his wife. The bank manager gave instructions for a legal charge to be signed by both Mr O'Brien and his wife, together with a guarantee to be signed by Mr O'Brien. He also instructed that both Mr O'Brien and his wife should be made aware of the nature of the transactions and that, if they had any doubts, to obtain independent advice.

However, the bank staff had not followed these instructions and subsequently both husband and wife signed the documents without reading them. When the company's indebtedness increased beyond the agreed limit, the bank took proceedings to enforce its security against the husband and wife. In her defence, Mrs O'Brien contended that, firstly, her husband had put undue pressure on her to sign the agreements and, secondly, that her husband misrepresented the effect of the legal charge in that she believed it was limited to a sum of £60,000 over three weeks when in fact the charge covered £135,000.

It was held by the House of Lords that the bank was aware that the parties were husband and wife and as such were put on notice that influence may be exercised. The bank had failed in its duty to take reasonable steps to warn the wife of the risks she ran in entering into the surety contract nor had it properly advised her to seek independent legal advice. On this basis, the bank was fixed with constructive notice of the [[Misrepresentation]] made by the husband to induce his wife into the surety contract and therefore the wife was entitled to have the legal charge set aside.

It was held that a creditor would be put on notice when:

>"…a wife offers to stand surety for her husband's debts by the combination of two factors: (a) the transaction is on its face not to the financial advantage of the wife; and (b) there is a substantial risk in transactions of that kind that, in procuring the wife to act as surety, the husband has committed a legal or equitable wrong that entitles the wife to set aside the transaction.

>

>It follows that unless the creditor who is put on inquiry takes reasonable steps to satisfy himself that the wife's agreement to stand surety has been properly obtained, the creditor will have constructive notice of the wife's rights."
