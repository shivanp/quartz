# Lambert v Lewis [1982] AC 225

A dealer supplied a defective trailer coupling to a customer who went on using it, after it was obviously broken, until there was an accident. The defect in the trailer coupling was an effective cause of the accident (so factual causation was established). But the question was whether, in terms of legal causation, the chain of causation was broken by the 'intervening act' of the customer's use of an obviously broken coupling.

It was held that the customer's use of the coupling was not something which objectively one would deem 'likely to happen'. It therefore was treated as breaking the chain of causation, and the dealer was held not liable for the accident.
