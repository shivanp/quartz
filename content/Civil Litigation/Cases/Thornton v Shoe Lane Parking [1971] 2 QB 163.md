# Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking [1971] 2 QB 163

Facts

The claimant parked his car in the defendant’s automated car park for a fee. A notice outside stated the charges and excluded liability for damage to cars. It did not mention anything about personal injury. A pillar near the ticket barrier (further into the premises) displayed eight lengthy ‘conditions’. The second condition stated that the defendant was not liable for any injury sustained on the premises. An automated machine near the barrier produced a ticket when the claimant entered. The ticket stated, in small lettering on the bottom, that it was ‘issued subject to conditions…displayed on the premises.’ The claimant did not see or read any of these notices.

The claimant suffered injury on the premises. They sued the defendant under occupier’s liability. The defendant sought to rely on the exemption condition on the pillar. The claimant disputed whether this clause was part of the contract between the parties.  
Issue(s)

    Was the exemption condition incorporated into the contract?

Decision

The Court of Appeal held in favour of the claimant. The claimant was not aware of the condition. The defendant had not done enough to give reasonable notice of the condition. Therefore, it was not part of the parties’ contract.  
This Case is Authority For…

A normal written clause is not incorporated into an unsigned contract unless:

   1. The claimant is aware of it;
   2. The defendant gave the claimant reasonable notice that the document contains contract terms; or
   3. A reasonable person would realise that the document contained contract terms.

However, where the clause is ‘unusual or onerous’, the defendant must do more. They must ensure that the claimant has reasonable notice of the clause itself, not just the fact that the document contains contractual clauses.

Lord Denning argued that ‘sufficient notice must usually be immediately noticable and eye-catching – ‘printed in red ink with a red hand pointing to it – or something equally startling.’

Lord Denning and Megaw LJ both thought that what constitutes ‘reasonable notice’ depends on the circumstances. A relevant factor is the nature of the intended exemption clause.  
Other

Lord Denning thought that the pillar notice could not be binding in any event, because it was only visible to the claimant after the contract was created. The defendant’s offer was the notice at the entrance, which the claimant accepted by driving in. By the time the claimant could have seen the notice on the pillar, it was too late.

The same was true of the words on the ticket. Lord Denning explained that in automated machine cases, the offer is made when the machines’ owner presents the machine as able to accept money. The customer accepts when the put money in the machine. This means that any terms placed on a ticket issued by the machine cannot be contractually binding, because the customer has had no opportunity to refuse them. By the time they see the ticket, there is no way of returning it.

> ‘’We have been referred to the ticket cases …These cases were based on the theory that the customer, on being handed the ticket, could refuse it and decline to enter into a contract on those terms. He could ask for his money back. That theory was, of course, a fiction. No customer in a thousand ever read the conditions. If he had stopped to do so, he would have missed the train or the boat. None of those cases has any application to a ticket which is issued by an automatic machine. The customer pays his money and gets a ticket. He cannot refuse it. He cannot get his money back. He may protest to the machine, even swear at it. But it will remain unmoved. He is committed beyond recall. He was committed at the very moment when he put his money into the machine. The contract was concluded at that time. It can be translated into offer and acceptance in this way: the offer is made when the proprietor of the machine holds it out as being ready to receive the money. The acceptance takes place when the customer puts his money into the slot. The terms of the offer are contained in the notice placed on or near the machine stating what is offered for the money. The customer is bound by those terms as long as they are sufficiently brought to his notice before-hand, but not otherwise. He is not bound by the terms printed on the ticket if they differ from the notice, because the ticket comes too late. The contract has already been made.’’  
> Lord Denning

This indicates that ‘reasonable notice’ must be given before the contract is created. Megaw LJ agreed, stating that:

‘it is a highly relevant factor in considering whether proper steps were taken fairly to bring that matter to the notice of the plaintiff that the first attempt to bring to his notice the intended inclusion of those conditions was at a time when as a matter of hard reality it would have been practically impossible for him to withdraw from his intended entry upon the premises for the purpose of leaving his car there.’
