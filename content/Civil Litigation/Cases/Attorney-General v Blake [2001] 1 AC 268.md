# Attorney-General v Blake [2001] 1 AC 268

FACTS: Blake, a former member of the intelligence services, undertook not to divulge any official information gained as a result of his employment and broke the undertaking by publishing his memoirs, '\No Other Choice'. The Crown sought to recover the royalties he was to be paid by his publishers.

HELD: Their Lordships confirmed that, in general, damages were measured by the claimant's loss, but held that in an exceptional case the court can require the defendant to account to the claimant for benefits received from a breach of contract.

In determining whether to order an account for profits, Lord Nicholls (with whom Lord Goff and Lord Browne-Wilkinson agreed) stated:

> 'An account of profits will be appropriate in exceptional circumstances. Normally the remedies of [compensatory] damages, specific performance and injunction, coupled with the characterisation of some contractual obligations as fiduciary, will provide an adequate response to breach of contract. It will only be in exceptional cases, where those remedies are inadequate, that any question of accounting for profits will arise. No fixed rules can be prescribed. The court will have regard to all the circumstances, including the subject matter of the contract, the purpose of the contractual provision which has been breached, the circumstances in which the breach occurred, the consequences of the breach and circumstances in which relief is being sought. A useful general guide, although not exhaustive, is whether the claimant had a legitimate interest in preventing the defendant's profit-making activity and, hence, in depriving him of his profit.'

The inadequacy of other remedies thus appears fundamental to the award of an account of profits. The claimant must also show that he has a 'legitimate interest' in depriving the defendant of his profit. The Crown was held to have such a 'legitimate interest' in Blake and no other remedy was adequate on the facts. If restitutionary damages had not been awarded, the Crown would have recovered nothing, since they had suffered no loss.

## Summary

B, a former member of the British Security Services and a Soviet spy, appealed the grant of an injunction preventing him from receiving any further payments from his publishers following the publication of his autobiography. The Attorney General cross appealed, contending that B's breach of contract in disclosing official secrets should carry with it an entitlement on the part of the Crown to seek recovery of any resultant profits by way of restitution. The court held that in an exceptional case, such as this, there was no bar to the grant of an order for an account of profits where that was the most appropriate remedy following a breach of contract.

## Abstract

B, a former member of the Secret Intelligence Services, SIS, who later became a Soviet agent, appealed against a decision ([1998] Ch. 439), that all profits derived from a book about the British Secret Service, including those to which he was entitled but had not yet received, be paid over to the Crown. B was employed by the SIS in 1944, and, in his contract of employment, signed an Official Secrets Act declaration not to disclose any information, in any form, about his work in the Secret Service. This contractual undertaking also applied after employment had ceased. B subsequently became a Soviet agent, for which he was imprisoned, but he later escaped to the Soviet Union.

In 1989, B wrote the book concerned and entered into an agreement with a UK publisher. The book contained information that was no longer confidential. He received some advance payments and was entitled to more. The Crown claimed whatever amount was owing to B, who appealed the grant of an injunction preventing him from receiving any further payments from his publishers. The Attorney-General cross appealed, arguing that B had committed a breach of contract and that the restitutionary principle should apply to enable the Crown to recover any profits to which B was entitled.

Held, dismissing the appeal and allowing the cross appeal, that in exceptional cases, where normal remedies were inadequate to compensate for breach of contract, it was open to the court to order that the defendant account for all profits either received or to which he is entitled.

This was an exceptional case in that the work of the Secret Service depends on the confidentiality of information. B had been responsible for harming the public interest by breaches of his undertaking not to divulge information. Publication of the book was a further breach of that undertaking, even though the information contained in it was no longer secret. However, it was noted that the disclosure of non-confidential information was also a criminal offence under the [Official Secrets Act 1911](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60DA52C1E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7f6b4eeec17a4496b55853f61f49ad8f&contextData=(sc.Default)). An absolute rule against disclosure was necessary in order to ensure that members of the secret services are able to deal with each other in complete confidence.

B was able to capitalise on his notoriety as a Soviet agent and would not have been able to command such high royalties. The Crown therefore had a legitimate interest in ensuring that B did not benefit from revealing state information in breach of contract. However, as normal contractual remedies of damages, specific performance and injunction would not meet that objective, the publishers should be ordered to pay over to the Crown any amount still owing to B.
