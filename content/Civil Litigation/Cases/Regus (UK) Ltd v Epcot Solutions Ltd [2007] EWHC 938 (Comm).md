# Regus (UK) Ltd v Epcot Solutions Ltd [2007] EWHC 938 (Comm)

## Summary

It was unreasonable for a company letting serviced office accommodation to exclude in broad terms liability for any "loss of business, loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, loss of damage to data, third party claims or any consequential loss" suffered, by reason of its negligence, by those occupying the offices.

## Abstract

The claimant (R) claimed for the recovery of unpaid fees for the use of serviced office accommodation let to the defendant (E). E counterclaimed for damages for misrepresentation and breach of contract.

E, a company providing information technology training, had entered into an agreement with R for the use of serviced office accommodation in which to run its training courses. The agreement was subject to R's standard terms and conditions, one of which purported to exclude liability "in any circumstances" for "loss of business, loss of profits, loss of anticipated savings, loss of damage to data, third party claims or any consequential loss". It also purported to limit the extent of its liability "in respect of all other losses, damages expenses or claims". E had initially occupied office accommodation close to Heathrow airport but was later required to move to another location, in respect of which it had entered into a further agreement on the same terms and conditions. The air conditioning system at that location did not, however, work satisfactorily and E had made several complaints to R, claiming that it was having a detrimental effect on its business. R took no effective steps to repair the air conditioning system. Negotiations between the parties failed to resolve the matter and R ultimately suspended services to E, claiming unpaid fees up to the end of the agreed term.

E submitted that it was entitled to

(1) the costs of its having to relocate from the Heathrow offices because it had entered into the initial agreement by reason of R's misrepresentation that it had a lengthy lease of that building and would not be moving out;  
(2) damages for loss of profits, loss of the opportunity to generate profits, and for distress, inconvenience and loss of amenity suffered by reason of R's failure to provide adequate air-conditioning.

## Held

Judgment accordingly.

(1) The evidence did not support E's contention that it had entered into the initial agreement by reason of any misrepresentation on R's part. In any event, since at that stage E had no security of tenure save for a series of short-term contracts with R, and R was therefore able to terminate E's use of the Heathrow offices at relatively short notice, E was in no position to rely on R's own security of tenure. E's claims for the costs of its relocation therefore failed.

(2) R had contracted to provide services to E which included air conditioning. It was clear from the evidence that, by reason of its negligent failure to repair the air conditioning system, R was in breach of its obligation to provide those services. E was therefore entitled to recover damages for any loss that it suffered, subject to the extent to which the exclusion in its terms and conditions effectively restricted its liability. Whilst it was reasonable for R to exclude liability for loss of profits and consequential losses, the exclusion clause was not reasonable in so far as it purported to deprive E of any remedy at all for failure to provide a basic service such as air conditioning. Although the clause provided the illusion of a remedy by limiting the extent of other liability, because of the broad wording of the exclusion of financial losses, a business would be unable to establish the liability that R sought to limit. The prospect of E recovering damages for loss of amenity was remote and uncertain: no authority had been provided to the court relating to a contract such as the instant one, whose business purpose was not to provide pleasure and amenity, _[Ruxley Electronics v Forsyth [1996] A.C. 344, [1995] 6 WLUK 384](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I91205150E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d76934fb463d47e1990b30ef486eea73&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. In those circumstances, such a broad exclusion was not reasonable and fell foul of the [Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 s.11](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IA467E9F1E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=d76934fb463d47e1990b30ef486eea73&contextData=(sc.Default)). E was therefore entitled to damages for loss suffered as a result of the air conditioning failures, to be assessed on a future date. The court noted, however, that while the failures had interfered with the efficient conduct of E's business and had been significant, they had not been crucial.

(3) The circumstances surrounding the end of the working relationship between the parties was messy and the issue of whether R had been justified in suspending services to E depended on whether there were any fees outstanding after having taken into account any damages due to E. That issue could only be concluded once the appropriate level of damages had been assessed.
