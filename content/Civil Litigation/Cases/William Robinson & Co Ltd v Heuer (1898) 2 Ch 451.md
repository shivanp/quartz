# William Robinson & Co Ltd v Heuer (1898) 2 Ch 451

 A term forbade the defendant to engage in 'any trade, business, or calling, either relating to goods of any description sold or manufactured by the claimant or in any other business whatsoever'. The court granted an injunction but on more limited terms: it did not restrain the defendant from engaging in 'any other business whatsoever', it only restrained the defendant from engaging in a narrower class of business. That gave the claimant reasonable protection but no more.
