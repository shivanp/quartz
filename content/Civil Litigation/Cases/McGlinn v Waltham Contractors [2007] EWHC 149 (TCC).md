# McGlinn v Waltham Contractors [2007] EWHC 149 (TCC)

The claimant was found to have acted unreasonably in demolishing and rebuilding an entire property to cure defective works for purely aesthetic reasons and limited the award to the costs which would have been incurred in remedying the defects in the original building.

---

## Summary

A claimant in a building dispute who had demolished and rebuilt a defective building was only entitled to damages for the cost of repair, rather than the cost of demolition and rebuilding, since the defects were aesthetic rather than structural, and he had not acted reasonably in demolishing the building.

## Abstract

The claimant employer (M) sought damages from the defendants (W, T, H and L) for breach of contract or negligence in building him a house.

W were the building contractors, T the architects, H the engineers and L the quantity surveyors. A number of defects were found when the house was completed and M, following professional advice, had it totally demolished. W went into administration and M sought damages from the other defendants.

M contended that  
(1) in accordance with the decision in _Hospital for Sick Children Board of Governors v McLaughlin & Harvey Plc 19 Con. L.R. 25_, the measure of loss was the cost of demolition and rebuilding, as that option had been advised by a professional;  
(2) alternatively, the measure of loss was the cost of repair;  
(3) T was in breach of its architects' duty of inspection.

## Held

Judgment for claimant in part.

(1) In an action against a contractor or a professional for defective work, the appropriate measure of loss was the cost of reinstatement, rather than diminution in the value of the property itself, _[East Ham Corp v Bernard Sunley & Sons [1966] A.C. 406, [1965] 10 WLUK 68](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I9F2069D0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6483066de09f4d93a9dbee3ce6812ece&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The critical issue was whether those reinstatement costs should be calculated by reference to the cost of demolition and rebuilding or the cost of repair. Although M's decision to demolish had been taken on expert advice which had not been negligent, that decision had not been exclusively based on the existence of defects which affected the structural soundness of the building, but was partly based on M's aesthetic criticisms, Board of Governors distinguished.

(2) The right measure of loss was the cost of the work necessary to repair the defects for which each defendant was liable.

(3) An architect had an obligation to make periodic inspection, which did not guarantee that all defective work would be revealed or prevented, _[Consarc Design Ltd v Hutch Investments Ltd 84 Con. L.R. 36, [2002] 2 WLUK 445](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8D468F00E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6483066de09f4d93a9dbee3ce6812ece&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. However, the frequency and duration of inspections had to be tailored to the nature of the works at the site from time to time, _[Corfield v Grant 59 B.L.R. 102, [1989] 11 WLUK 100](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5782FCA0E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6483066de09f4d93a9dbee3ce6812ece&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. Thus, it was not enough for T to have carried out an inspection only at the time of the monthly site meetings. Inspections at such times were not necessarily suitable for the particular progress of the works on site and were, furthermore, telegraphed in advance. T had also failed to keep records of the inspections' findings.
