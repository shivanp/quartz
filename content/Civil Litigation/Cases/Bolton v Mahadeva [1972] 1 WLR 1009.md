# Bolton v Mahadeva [1972] 1 WLR 1009

## Facts

By a contract with the defendant, the claimant undertook to install a central heating system in the defendant's house at a cost of £560. The system did not work, and the defendant refused to pay any money. The cost of remedying the defects would have been £174. The court had to determine whether the claimant was entitled to recover any payment under the contract.

## Held

Whether or not the contract had been substantially performed should be viewed with regard to the purpose of the contract and the circumstances as a whole. The purpose of the contract in this case was to install a central heating system to heat a house. If that system did not function adequately and moreover produced harmful fumes, then it was not possible to say that the contract had been substantially performed. Accordingly, the claimant was not entitled to recover any of the contract price but, had he offered to remedy the defects, and had then done so, he would be justified in claiming the contract price.
