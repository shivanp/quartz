# Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International [1998] AC 20

An employee had worked for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), which collapsed in 1991, amidst allegations that the bank had operated in a corrupt and dishonest manner. The employee claimed that having worked for BCCI had adversely affected his employment prospects.

The House of Lords found that the employee did have the basis for a cause of action against his former employer for the loss caused by the way it was alleged that its business had been run. This was based on the fact that contracts of employment contain an implied term of trust and confidence, such that the employer is under an obligation to carry out its work in an honest way. Damages were awarded but were limited to the claimant's financial loss, which was suffered due to an inability to obtain alternative employment resulting from breach of this implied term.

## Abstract

M and another, both former employees of BCCI, appealed against the dismissal of their appeal against a preliminary decision that they were not entitled to recover damages for injury to their reputation, and consequent difficulties in finding new employment, allegedly caused by BCCI conducting a dishonest or corrupt business. BCCI's liquidators argued that injury to reputation was protected by defamation and a claim should not be allowed in contract that would not succeed in tort, and that, in any case, the claims for damages to the employees' existing reputations were barred by _[Withers v General Theatre Co Ltd [1933] 2 K.B. 536, [1933] 6 WLUK 32](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0906E5D0E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6412ff55157240aeaf3db3c93581a2a1&contextData=(sc.Default))_.

Held, allowing the appeal, that BCCI was under an implied obligation not to conduct a corrupt and dishonest business, being one aspect of a general implied contractual obligation not to engage in conduct likely to undermine the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee. Where the loss suffered by an employee as a result of a breach of this implied term did not simply consist of premature termination losses, for example where the breach adversely affected future employment prospects, such continuing financial losses were, in principle, recoverable, subject to questions of foreseeability, remoteness and mitigation.

To limit recovery to premature termination losses was an unacceptably narrow interpretation of the trust and confidence term and employers had a duty not do acts that would damage employees' future employment prospects, _[Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] A.C. 488, [1909] 7 WLUK 102](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I5331C8C0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6412ff55157240aeaf3db3c93581a2a1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ distinguished. Further, the fact that the loss might be recoverable in defamation did not preclude it being recovered as damages for breach of contract. The ruling in _[Marbe v George Edwardes (Daly's Theatre) Ltd [1928] 1 K.B. 269, [1927] 7 WLUK 32](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IEE0651E1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=6412ff55157240aeaf3db3c93581a2a1&contextData=(sc.Default))_, that damages for loss to existing reputation could be recovered, was to be preferred to the judgment in Withers.
