# Blue v Ashley [2017] EWHC 1928 (Comm)

## Summary

A statement made during an informal meeting in a pub by the majority owner of a company that he would pay a consultant £15 million if he raised the company's share price to £8 would not reasonably have been understood as a serious offer capable of creating a legally binding contract.

## Abstract

The claimant claimed £14 million pursuant to an alleged oral contract made between him and the defendant businessman.

The defendant owned the majority of the shares in a sports retail company. The claimant was appointed to provide consultancy services to the company and became involved in investor relations. The company needed a corporate broker. In January 2013, the claimant and defendant had an informal meeting in a pub with three representatives of a potential broker. Most of the group were drinking alcohol. During a conversation described by the broker's representatives as "banter", the defendant allegedly agreed to pay the claimant £15 million if he was able to raise the company's share price to £8. It was then around £4. No written record was kept. The claimant's evidence was that he first reminded the defendant of the agreement in December 2013. In February 2014, the price hit £8. In May 2014, the defendant paid the claimant £1 million. The claimant's evidence was that that was a sign of the defendant's commitment to the agreement. The claimant resigned in September 2014, citing a lack of clarity regarding his position with the company. The defendant's evidence was that he could not recall making the offer in the pub and that the £1 million had been paid for unconnected reasons.

The defendant denied that any legally binding contract had arisen.

## Held

Judgment for defendant.

**What was said?** The evidence indicated that the substance of the "agreement" made at the pub was that, if the claimant could get the share price to £8 per share within an unspecified time, the defendant would pay him £15 million (see para.[79](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

**Binding contract?** The defendant's statement that he would pay the claimant the £15 million would not reasonably have been understood as a serious offer capable of creating a legally binding contract. The statement had been made in a pub when a fair amount of alcohol had been consumed. Although there was evidence that the defendant made alcohol freely available at the company's senior management meetings, showing that he combined business discussions with alcohol consumption, nothing suggested that he had ever negotiated a contract at such a meeting, and the pub evening had been considerably less formal in any case. Both claimant and defendant had been representing the company in meeting representatives of a prospective service provider; serious discussion of the claimant's remuneration would have been extraneous to the meeting's purpose. The jocular nature of the conversation was inconsistent with an intention to make a serious contractual offer. The defendant had had no commercial reason to offer the £15 million. That was far more than he could possibly have thought necessary to offer. The claimant also assumed that his efforts had the potential to increase the share price by a substantial amount. There was no reason to make such an assumption, nor to suppose that the defendant would have done so. The idea that the claimant could somehow, through his skills and contacts, get the share price to double was plainly fanciful. The offer was far too vague to have been seriously meant. Serious discussion would have required consideration of exactly what work the claimant would do and how the effect of his work was to be measured. There had also been no agreed timescale or discussion of a period of time for which the price would need to stay above £8. None of the witnesses to the conversation thought it was serious. The claimant had not understood there to be an intention to make a contract at the time of the conversation. It was improbable, if he had understood that, that he would have made no written record of the agreement or that he would have waited almost a year before mentioning it again to the defendant (paras [80-107](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Later events -** Events after the pub conversation did not support the suggestion that the defendant believed he had promised the bonus, or that the claimant had believed he was entitled to it until after he resigned. The defendant appeared to have no recollection of why he made the £1 million payment, but whatever his reasons, he had not said anything to suggest that he was acknowledging an obligation to pay £15 million. Had the claimant understood the £1 million as a first instalment, he would have asked about further payments, but he had not suggested he was owed any more money until after he resigned (paras [126-132](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Certainty -** No period had been agreed within which the price had to reach £8. The court could not fill that gap by implying a term that the obligation would be performed within a reasonable time: there was no objective standard it could invoke to identify a reasonable period. That could only be decided by express agreement between the parties. The offer could not create a contract because it lacked an essential term (para.[136](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Was payment triggered?** Even if there had been a contract, the claimant had not proved that he caused the price to reach £8: he had not shown that, but for his work, the price would not have reached £8 (paras [137-141](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
