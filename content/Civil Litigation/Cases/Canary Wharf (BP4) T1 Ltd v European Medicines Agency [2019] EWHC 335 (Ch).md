# Canary Wharf (BP4) T1 Ltd v European Medicines Agency [2019] EWHC 335 (Ch)

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) argued that its lease of its headquarters premises in Canary Wharf was frustrated when it was forced to move its headquarters to Amsterdam following Brexit. Mr Justice Smith found that there was no common purpose which had been frustrated, and that the parties had divergent purposes when they entered into the bargain set out in the lease. The EMA wanted premises which suited its purposes, but with flexibility as to exit and a low rent. The landlord in contrast wanted a secure long term cash flow opportunity and a balance on its obligations as to the condition of the premises. They had bargained for the possibility that the EMA might not fulfil the full term for some reason (albeit not due to Brexit) when they entered into the contract. Putting it another way, had Brexit been a possibility, then the parties could have taken it into account and still agreed an adjusted commercial arrangement. The nature of the bargain had therefore not fundamentally changed for both parties.
