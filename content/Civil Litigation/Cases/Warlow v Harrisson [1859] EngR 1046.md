# Warlow v Harrisson [1859] EngR 1046

## Facts

An auction of a pony "without reserve" was advertised by the defendant. However the defendant sold the pony back to the owner at the highest price.

## Held

Where an auction is pledged to be without reserve, the contract is made with the highest bona fide bidder, which in the case of a breach, has a right of action against the auctioneer. Therefore the defendant breached this contract with the claimant, the highest bona fide bidder.
