# Sky Petroleum Ltd v VIP Petroleum Ltd [1974] 1 All ER 954

The defendant agreed to supply petrol to the claimant for a set period of time. In breach of contract, the defendant terminated the agreement early. The claimant sought an interim injunction preventing the defendant from terminating and withholding the supply.

The court held that although the injunction requested appeared to be in 'negative' terms (broadly, the defendant must not terminate the agreement / withhold supply), the effect of the injunction would be to require the defendant to supply petrol to the claimant. This is a requirement that the defendant should do what the contract says it must do, and so in substance is an order for specific performance. Accordingly, the court decided the case according to the principles that apply to orders for specific performance, not those that apply to interim injunctions (and on the particular facts, the court found in the claimant's favour).
