# Shogun Finance Ltd V Hudson [2004] 1 AC 919

#key-case

## Facts

In this case, a fraudster visited the showrooms of a car dealer and agreed to buy a car on hire-purchase terms. The fraudster signed a draft finance agreement in the name of Mr Patel. As proof of identity, the fraudster produced a genuine but unlawfully obtained driving licence in the name of a Mr Patel. The car dealer sent the signed document and a copy of the licence to the finance company, Shogun Finance Ltd. The finance company checked the credit rating of Mr Patel and approved the sale. The fraudster paid a minimal deposit and drove the car away with its accompanying paperwork. The fraudster immediately sold the car on to an innocent third party, Mr Hudson. The finance company traced the car to Mr Hudson and sued him for the return of the car, or its value.

## Held

Shogun Finance Ltd was entitled to the return of the car as the contract was void for mistake.

The House of Lords has held that a hire-purchase agreement under which a fraudster obtained a car by pretending to be someone else was void.

**Summary.** The House of Lords has [held](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/4-106-7436?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=29998b3942d84daabd9c01fd2a836a58) that a hire-purchase agreement under which a fraudster obtained a car by pretending to be someone else was void.

**Background.** In cases of mistake as to identity, the courts have distinguished between contracts made in person and contracts made in writing. In the former situation, there is a presumption that each party intends to deal with the person in front of them, while in the latter, the identity of the parties is ascertained by construing the written document.

A person who is not the owner of goods and who does not sell them with the owner's consent cannot transfer title to the purchaser. However, if a motor vehicle has been bailed under a hire-purchase agreement, a private purchaser acting in good faith without notice of the hire-purchase agreement may acquire good title to the vehicle from the bailee (_section 27, Hire-Purchase Act 1964_) (1964 Act).

**Facts.** R entered into a hire-purchase agreement for a motor car with S, a finance company, at a car dealer's premises by pretending to be P. R then sold the vehicle to H. H asserted that he had obtained good title to the vehicle by virtue of section 27 of the 1964 Act. The trial judge held that there was no hire-purchase agreement between S and R, and therefore H could not acquire good title under the 1964 Act. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision (_[www.practicallaw.com/A19253](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/5-101-5319?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=29998b3942d84daabd9c01fd2a836a58)_). H appealed.

**Decision.** The court dismissed the appeal by majority and held that the hire-purchase agreement was made in writing and therefore the identity of the parties depended on its construction. The presumption regarding "face-to-face" contracts did not apply. Before entering into the agreement, S checked that P existed and that he was creditworthy. On that basis, S decided to contract with P and no-one else. There was no hire-purchase agreement with R and, consequently, H could not acquire good title. The dissenting judges stated that the distinction between "face-to-face" contracts and written contracts in these circumstances should be removed, and that wherever two persons deal with each other, via any medium, there should be a contract between them, albeit one which is voidable by the innocent party.

**Comment.** Two features are usually present in cases of this type. The first is that the seller of the goods in question is concerned with the creditworthiness of the proposed buyer. Here, the common law distinguishes between a case where a fraudster asserts that he is creditworthy and where a fraudster asserts that he is someone else who is known by the seller to be creditworthy. In the first situation, the contract between the seller and the buyer is voidable_._ However, in the second situation, whether the contract is voidable or void will depend upon the method by which the contract was made (that is, whether "face-to-face" or in writing).

The second feature is that the fraudster then sells the goods to an innocent third party. This person's rights often depend on whether the first contract was voidable or void. Where the fraudster misrepresents his creditworthiness, the loss falls on the original seller. However, where the fraudster misrepresents his identity, the loss will sometimes fall upon the innocent third party, depending on whether the original contract is void or voidable.

Against this background, the dissenting judgment of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead seems to have much to recommend it. In his view, the distinction between both the type of misrepresentation and between the method of contracting are unconvincing. He argued that, as a matter of policy, and as between two innocent persons, the loss is more appropriately borne by the person who takes the risks inherent in parting with his goods without receiving payment. He also argued that this course made practical sense, in that it was little short of absurd that a subsequent buyer's rights could depend on the precise manner in which the fraudster seeks to persuade the owner of his creditworthiness and to permit him to take the goods away with him.
