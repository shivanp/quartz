# Harry Kendall & Sons v William Lillico & Sons Ltd [1969] 2 AC 31

Facts

The claimants were game farmers. They bought food for their birds from the defendants. However, when the chicks ate the food, many became sick and died. This was due to a toxic mould substance in the groundnuts from which the food was made. The defendants had bought the product from two third-parties.

The defendant’s contract with the third parties was made orally. However, the third-parties alleged that a clause stating that the buyer took responsibility for any ‘latent defects’ in the product was incorporated into the contract by a consistent course of dealing. In their previous dealings with the third-parties, the defendants had been given a note containing this term. However, they never read it.

The claimant sued the defendants for breach of contract. In the present proceedings, the defendants brought an action against the two third-parties. They argued that the third-parties should be required to indemnify them against the claimant’s claim. The third-parties, they alleged, were in breach of statutory terms with regards to the quality of the goods. The third parties relied on the ‘latent defects’ clause as excluding their liability.  
Issue(s)

1. Were the third parties in breach of the statutory terms?
2. Was the latent defects clause incorporated into the parties’ contract?
3. Could they rely on the latent defects clause as excluding their liability?

Decision

The House of Lords held that:

- The third parties were in breach of the statutory terms.
- The latent defects clause was incorporated into the contract.
- The latent defects clause was not worded clearly enough to exclude liability for breach of the statutory terms. It should be construed as only excluding liability for those defects which did not prevent compliance with the statutory terms.
