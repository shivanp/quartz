# Pan Atlantic Co Ltd v Pine Top Insurance Co Ltd [1995] 1 AC 501

## Abstract

A circumstance may be material for the purposes of an insurance contract (whether marine or non-marine) even though it would not have had a decisive effect on the prudent underwriter's decision whether to accept the risk. P wrote a quantity of direct American liability insurance, much of it “long-tail” business, in which a long period of time may elapse before claims mature. D became reinsurer for excess of loss above a certain figure for the 1980 policy year and for two subsequent years. Disputes arose in relation to all three years. Judgment was given in favour of P as regards the first two policy years, but the judge found for D in respect of the third. It was common ground that, in respect of the contract of reinsurance for that year, the disclosed losses for the previous year were significantly lower than the true losses and that P had information about those additional losses before the slip had been signed. The judge held that the additional losses had been material to the contract and should have been disclosed and that, accordingly, D was entitled to avoid the contract ([1992] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 101). The Court of Appeal (Times, March 8, 1993) dismissed P's appeal.

Held, dismissing P's appeal, that

(1) (Lord Templeman and Lord Lloyd of Berwick dissenting) a circumstance may be material for the purposes of an insurance contract (whether marine or non-marine) even though it would not have had a decisive effect on the prudent underwriter's decision whether to accept the risk or on the amount of premium demanded;

(2) however, an underwriter who was not induced by the material non-disclosure to make the contract could not rely on the non-disclosure to avoid the contract (_[Berger and Light Diffusers Pty Ltd v Pollock [1973] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 442, [1973] 7 WLUK 1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I73DB72B0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=236d06b1c4054554b6b1551003e598d4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ approved; _[Container Transport International Inc v Oceanus Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Ltd (No.1) [1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 476, [1984] 1 WLUK 1073](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8D7232E0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=236d06b1c4054554b6b1551003e598d4&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled in part); and

(3) the additional losses for 1981 had been a material circumstance that ought to have been disclosed and the judge's conclusion that D were entitled to avoid the contract should stand.

> ‘In the general law it is beyond doubt that even a fraudulent misrepresentation must be shown to have induced the contract before the promisor has a right to avoid, although the task of proof may be made more easy by a presumption of inducement.’
