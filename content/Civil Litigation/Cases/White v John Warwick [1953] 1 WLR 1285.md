# White v John Warwick [1953] 1 WLR 1285

 The claimant, Mr White, hired a bike from the defendants. He was thrown off the bike and injured when the saddle tipped up. Clause 11 of the agreement provided that the defendants would not be liable for any:

“[P]ersonal injuries to the riders of the machines hired…"

Putting aside the exclusion clause, the defendants could have been liable for such injuries on the basis of:

a) a failure to supply a bike which was reasonably fit for purpose (on the basis of a predecessor of s 14(2) SGA 1979), or

b) on the basis of negligence in failing to ensure the bike was in a proper working condition.

Lord Justice Denning held that:

>“Where there are two possible heads of liability on the part of defendant, one for negligence, and the other a strict liability, an exemption clause will be construed, so far as possible, as exempting the defendant only from his strict liability and not as relieving him from his liability for negligence.”

Accordingly, the exemption clause **did not** exclude liability for negligence.
