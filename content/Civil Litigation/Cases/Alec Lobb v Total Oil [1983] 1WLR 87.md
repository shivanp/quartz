# Alec Lobb v Total Oil [1983] 1WLR 87

Alec Lobb was the owner of a petrol station. Lobb was in grave financial difficulty. He contacted Total Oil, and proposed to sell the station to them, and then lease it back from them. This would provide him with a lump sum payment (for the petrol station) which he could use to relieve his immediate financial problems, and he would then pay monthly lease payments to Total Oil instead. The lease was set to last 51 years, and for 21 years Lobb could only purchase the oil from Total Oil. These terms were very much in Total Oil's favour, and Total Oil had been able to negotiate such favourable terms because Lobb's credit history was very poor and he would have struggled to obtain financial help elsewhere.

Lobb later sought to allege the contract had been entered into as a result of duress. The court disagreed. Hard bargaining did not amount to duress, and Lobb has chosen to enter into the agreement despite receiving legal advice not to do so.
