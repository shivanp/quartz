# Banco de Portugal v Waterlow & Sons [1932] AC 452

Lord Macmillan said:

> ‘Where the sufferer from a breach of contract finds himself in consequence of that breach placed in a position of embarrassment, the measures which he may be driven to adopt in order to extricate himself ought not to be weighed in nice scales at the instance of the party whose breach of contract has occasioned the difficulty. It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticise the steps which have been taken to meet it, but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency.
>
> The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult position by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken.’

This case concerned an international banking fraud involving a firm of printers in London (Waterlow & Sons (“Waterlow”)) and the National Bank of Portugal (“the Bank”).  

To summarise, Waterlow held an exclusive agreement with the Bank of Portugal to produce Portuguese banknotes to be distributed in the UK. In 1925, Waterlow were tricked by a gang of international criminals into printing 580,000 banknotes. The criminals subsequently put the notes into circulation. Once the general public became aware of the existence of the unauthorised currency, it caused a run on the Bank. The Bank, in turn, unsurprisingly lost a significant amount of money.  

The Bank pursued an action against Waterlow to recover the loss that they had suffered.  Waterlow were found at first instance to have breached their duty of care and contractual duty to the Bank by printing (however innocently) the banknotes for the criminals. However, Waterlow criticised how the Bank handled the affair. The Bank had voluntarily withdrawn the notes (including the legitimate notes) of the denomination printed by Waterlow. This led to a significant loss for the Bank.  Waterlow argued that the Bank should instead have taken a more discreet measure to eliminate the unauthorised notes, which would inevitably have led to a lower level of loss.

## House of Lords

The matter reached the House of Lords and the issue of mitigation was directly addressed by Lord McMillan. Lord Macmillan expressed very little sympathy for the criticism that Waterlow directed at the Bank.  While acknowledging that it would be expected that a claimant take reasonable steps to limit its loss, Lord Macmillan stated that their behaviour should not be weighed _“in nice scales at the insistence of the party whose breach of contract had occasioned that difficulty”_. Instead, the claimant should only be expected to take reasonable steps to mitigate his loss. The claimant should not be expected to take any and all steps available to him. The claimant does not have to overcome a high bar; particularly where the defendant is an admitted wrongdoer.  

In the context of the Banco De Portugal case, Lord Macmillan found that the Bank had acted reasonably in voluntarily withdrawing all the banknotes of that denomination.
