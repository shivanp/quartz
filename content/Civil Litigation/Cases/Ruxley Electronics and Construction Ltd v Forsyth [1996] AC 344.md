# Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth [1996] AC 344

## Facts

Mr Forsyth employs Ruxley Electronics to build a swimming pool in his garden at a cost of £17,797.40. The contract provides that the pool should be 7 feet 6 inches deep. Ruxley Electronics builds it only to a depth of 6 feet. The pool is still perfectly safe for swimming and diving.

What sum of money is needed to put Mr Forsyth in the position as if the contract had been performed?

To the public at large, the pool is worth the same whether 6 or 7 ½ feet deep. So perhaps Mr Forsyth has suffered no loss, so should receive no damages. Does that seem fair?

Or should he receive enough damages to allow him to rebuild the pool to the contract depth? — this would mean completely demolishing the existing pool and starting again, at a cost of £21,560. Does that seem fair? If Mr Forsyth receives £21,560 but doesn't actually spend the damages on rebuilding the pool, then he has a fully functioning (6 foot deep) pool and £21,560 in his pocket. But should it matter how he spends his damages?

## Held

Their Lordships were of the opinion that it would be unreasonable for the claimant to insist on cost of cure because the expense of the work involved would be out of all proportion to the benefit to be obtained. Furthermore, the claimant's lack of intention to carry out the remedial works was relevant to the extent of the loss which was sustained since, if the claimant did not intend to cure the defect, he had lost nothing except the difference in value, if any. Where the diminution in value caused by the breach was nil, it was not correct automatically to award the cost of cure as an alternative to the difference in value, since it could not be right to remedy the injustice of awarding too little by unjustly awarding too much. Their Lordships went on to state that diminution in value and cost of cure were not the only available measures for recovery for breach of contract, and considered an alternative — loss of amenity.

Their lordships awarded £2,500 in loss of amenity damages, reflecting the non economic loss of pleasure Mr Forsyth suffered in not getting the pool he contracted for.
