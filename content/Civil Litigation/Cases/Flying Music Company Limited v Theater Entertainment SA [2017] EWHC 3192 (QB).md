# Flying Music Company Limited v Theater Entertainment SA [2017] EWHC 3192 (QB)

The negative effect on a contract in Greece of civil unrest and the economic crisis could not amount to frustration because at the time the contract concluded there were already signs of unrest. Although Theater Entertainment had hoped matters would improve, there was a risk that they might not and the parties were deemed to have had the opportunity to deal with this risk and allocate responsibility for it in the terms of the contract that was eventually concluded. The Court refused to re-allocate the risks by intervening in the contract and deeming it frustrated.
