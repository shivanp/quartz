# BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No.2) [1982] 1 All ER 925

## Facts

Hunt owned the right to oil from a Libyan oil field. He could not afford to develop the oil field on his own, so he entered an agreement with BP whereby they would pay the development costs in return for (i) a half stake in the oil field, and (ii) reimbursement of some of the costs out of Hunt’s half, once the oil started pumping. In other words, Hunt would not have to contribute to the high costs of finding and extracting the oil in the field.

Large sums were spent by BP, and they found and extracted some oil. Libya expropriated BP’s half of the concession after Gaddafi’s 1969 revolution. The Libyan government allowed Hunt to take oil for about two more years before his half was also expropriated.

BP brought a claim against Hunt on the basis that their agreement had been frustrated, and therefore they were entitled to a just sum to reflect the non-money benefits accrued to Hunt, for example the oil he received, but also the benefit of BP’s expertise in finding and extracting the oil for him.

A key question was whether the valuable benefit gained by Hunt was the value of the work carried out by BP (i.e. the value of finding and developing the oilfield) or the value of the end benefit received by Hunt (significantly less, because the oil field was significantly devalued by having been expropriated by the Libyan Government).

## Held

On the wording of the legislation, it was clear that 'benefit' meant the end product of the claimant's services, not the services themselves. So in this case, the lesser of the two options.
