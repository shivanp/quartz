# Background

The City Treasurer wrote to a tenant saying that the council ‘may be prepared to sell the house to you at the purchase price of £2,725, less 20 per cent = £2,180 (freehold)’. The letter went on: ‘If you would like to make a formal application to buy your council house please complete the form and return it to me as soon as possible'. The tenant completed and returned the form. Subsequently, the Council changed its policy on the sale of council houses, and, accordingly, the tenant was advised that the Council was unable to proceed with his application. The tenant brought his action claiming that the Council's letter was an offer which he had accepted by returning the application form.

# Held

(By the House of Lords) There was no binding contract because there was never an offer made by the Council. The Council's letter stating that it ‘may be prepared to sell’ was not sufficiently clear and certain to be an offer. It was merely the first step in negotiations, lacking the requisite intention to be legally bound.
