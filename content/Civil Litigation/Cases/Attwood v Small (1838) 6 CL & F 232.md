# Attwood v Small (1838) 6 CL & F 232

The vendor of a mine made wildly exaggerated statements about its earning capacity. The purchaser did not believe the glowing reports made by the vendor and, therefore, sent his own agent to make an independent report. The agent produced a similarly glowing report to that of the vendor. The mine then turned out to be virtually worthless, and the purchaser brought a claim, maintaining that the prospects of the mine had been misrepresented to him. The claim was dismissed. The purchaser had not relied on the statement of the vendor, but had been induced to purchase the mine on the strength of his own agent's report: a party cannot bring a claim in misrepresentation when it has relied not on the misrepresentation, but on its own investigations.
