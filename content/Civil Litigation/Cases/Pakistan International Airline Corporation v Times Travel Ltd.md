# Pakistan International Airline Corporation v Times Travel Ltd

## Background

A contract may be voidable where it has been entered under duress, as one party is pressured into making or varying a contract by threats. Economic duress was first recognised in the 1970s, with the House of Lords accepting the principle in _Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1983] 1 AC 366_. The classic example of economic duress occurs where a party threatens to cancel a contract unless the other party agrees to certain conditions, which it would otherwise have no practical choice but to accept.

In order to prove economic duress, the aggrieved party must show:

- Illegitimate pressure, for which there is no commercial or similar justification, which may include a threatened tort or breach of contract.
	
- That it would not have entered the contract but for the illegitimate economic pressure.
	
- The effect of the pressure is that there is a lack of practical choice for the claimant.

However, whether a particular threat amounts to illegitimate economic pressure, as opposed to the pressures of normal commercial bargaining, will be highly fact specific. Previous cases have shown that the courts will take into account:

- The seriousness of the impropriety.
	
- Whether the party exerting the pressure acted in good or bad faith.
	
- If the innocent party protested at the time.
	
- Whether the innocent party had any realistic practical alternative.

The doctrine of duress has long been established in respect of unlawful acts, such as the threat of violence or the seizure of goods. However, the position in relation to threats to carry out lawful acts is controversial, given the fact that many contracts are entered into under some form of pressure exerted by the other party.

## Facts

Pakistan International Airlines ("PIAC") was the sole operator of direct flights between the UK and Pakistan and the national flag carrier airline of Pakistan. A small travel agent, Times Travel, sold tickets to fly on PIAC pursuant to an agency agreement.

A dispute arose between the parties resulting in Times Travel making claims for unpaid commissions on sales of tickets. However, Times Travel was pressured by PIAC to waive those claims for unpaid commissions under its existing contract with PIAC, which was expiring, under the threat of PIAC not continuing its relationship with Times Travel. In particular, PIAC gave notice to Times Travel that their existing agency agreement would be terminated and suddenly reduced Times Travel's fortnightly ticket allocation from 300 to 60 tickets, as PIAC was entitled to do under the existing contract.

The ticket reduction had a major impact on Times Travel and would have put it out of business if it had continued. Although PIAC had no obligation to enter the new contract with Times Travel, its threat of not doing so placed Times Travel in the position of having no viable alternative but to waive its pre-existing claims, because its business depended on having PIAC tickets to sell.

Times Travel therefore waived its claims when entering into the new agreement. However, it subsequently brought a claim against PIAC for the unpaid commission. It argued that it could rescind the new contract for lawful act economic duress, and that the waiver should not bind it in light of the circumstances in which it had been obtained.

Warren J held that Times Travel was entitled to rescind the new contract for duress, allowing it to claim the commissions, but also found that PIAC had genuinely believed that the disputed commission was not due. PIAC appealed.

The Court of Appeal, with David Richards LJ delivering judgment, upheld PIAC's appeal, on the basis that a claim for lawful act duress would not succeed in a commercial context where a party was making lawful threats in support of a demand that it genuinely and reasonably believed it was entitled to make. PIAC had not acted in bad faith in the required sense (see _[Legal update, Court of Appeal clarifies scope of lawful act duress](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/w-020-3798?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&ppcid=c15f573b1d104b0f9efd9a5fd7a9b185)_). Times Travel appealed to the Supreme Court.

By the time of the Supreme Court hearing, Times Travel advocated a broad iteration of economic duress based on a multi-factor approach, similar to that adopted in _Patel v Mirza [2016] UKSC 42_ in respect of illegality. PIAC, in contrast, argued that economic duress should be abolished, or in any event applied narrowly.

### The Interventions

The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking ("APPG"), the Law Debenture Trust (the "Trustee") and the State of Ukraine all intervened in the Supreme Court hearing. The APPG advocated a restatement of the doctrine based on the principle of good faith, due to its concerns about the experiences of bank customers being placed under lawful but illegitimate pressure.

The remaining two interveners are engaged in existing Supreme Court proceedings, in which they await judgment. The proceedings concern notes with a nominal value of $3billion issued by Ukraine, the sole subscriber of which was the Russian Federation. While the principal amount of the notes fell due for payment in 2015, Ukraine has claimed it is entitled to avoid the notes on the basis of duress arising from allegedly unlawful threats made by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. In Times Travel, the Trustee argued that lawful act duress should be abolished, with Ukraine adopting an opposing position.

## Decision

The Supreme Court dismissed Time Travel's appeal. The main judgment was given by Lord Hodge, with whom all but Lord Burrows agreed. Lord Burrows delivered a minority judgment, reaching the same conclusion as the majority, but by a different route.

### Lawful Act Duress

All of the judges agreed that lawful act duress exists and comprises the following elements:

- There is a threat (or pressure exerted) by the defendant that is illegitimate.
	
- The illegitimate threat (or pressure) caused the claimant to enter into the contract.
	
- The claimant had no reasonable alternative to giving in to the threat (or pressure).

The majority judgment stated that "the boundaries of the doctrine of lawful act duress are not fixed and the courts should approach any extension with caution".

The Court recounted the circumstances, by reference to previous case law, in which the doctrine of lawful act duress had applied to date, being:

- Exploitation of knowledge of criminal activity by the claimant (or those associated with it).
	
- Using illegitimate means to manoeuvre the claimant into a position of weakness to force it to waive its claim.

While these circumstances were not stated to be exhaustive, the judgment reiterated that the doctrine was to be applied restrictively. The majority warned of an approach focused on unconscionability as an overreaching criterion and stressed the need to consider the law of economic duress against the backdrop of other relevant remedies available. The court discussed the absence of a common law doctrine of inequality of bargaining power in contract. It also noted that English law does not, unlike other jurisdictions, recognise a general principle of good faith in contracting. The court considered that the absence of these doctrines restricted the scope for lawful act economic duress in commercial life and accordingly pressure applied by a party in negotiations would rarely reach the standard of illegitimate pressure or unconscionable conduct.

### Rejection of 'bad Faith Demand' Requirement

Lord Burrowsâ€™ minority judgment advocated an alternative approach as to what will constitute illegitimate pressure, grounded in the Court of Appeal case, _CTN Cash and Carry Ltd v Gallaher Ltd [1994] 4 All ER 714_. He considered that where there is a demand for the waiver of a claim, it is a necessary requirement for establishing lawful act economic duress that the demand is made in bad faith (in the sense that the threatening party does not genuinely believe it has a defence to the claim being waived by the other party).

However, the majority rejected this approach and sought to clarify that _CTN Cash and Carry_ was authority for what did not constitute economic duress, as opposed to what did. In addition, where the claimant was induced to meet the other party's demand because of the stark inequality of bargaining power, which otherwise gave the claimant no effective choice but to meet the demand, that would not be sufficient to establish a claim for economic duress without a general principle of contractual good faith or a doctrine of imbalance of bargaining power, neither of which existed. They stated that allowing such claims would permit unwanted contractual uncertainty.

The majority added that:

- The demand for a waiver, to which the defendant must know that it had no prior entitlement, is no different in principle to asking for a sum of money as a pre-condition to a contract in a commercial negotiation.
	
- There is no support for the proposition that the mere assertion of bargaining power, such as a lawful threat to terminate an existing contract, or to reduce the supply of goods under the contract in a way which the contract allowed, could (without more) amount to illegitimate pressure.

### Rejection of Alternative Approaches

The Court rejected three other approaches:

- A multi-factorial approach to economic duress advocated for by Times Travel, as an analogous approach to the court's adoption of that methodology in _Patel V Mirza_ in the context of illegality as a defence. Lord Burrows and the majority both agreed that, since illegality as a defence had evolved to encompass inappropriate rules which clashed with the desired outcomes, the Supreme Court needed to draw on the reasoning of the decisions and put forward a range of factors which would reflect the underlying policies. In the long term this approach may lead to the formulation of appropriate rules. By contract, lawful act economic duress was not a doctrine riddled with unsatisfactory rules and instead, given the law was in its infancy, the common law should be "clarified or develop in a traditional incremental way".
	
- The approach based on good faith that the APPG had proposed. This was rejected on the basis that it could require a court to "try to apply a standard of what is commercially unacceptable or unreasonable behaviour", which Lord Burrows described as a "radical move forward" in the law.
	
- An approach based on transposing the elements of blackmail, as suggested by Leggatt LJ (as he then was) in _[[Al Nehayan v Kent [2018] EWHC 333 (Comm)]]_. This approach was dismissed on the basis it would "risk rendering the law on lawful act duress too uncertain and would potentially jeopardise the stability of the English law of contract".

## Comment

This is a significant case, given that it is the first time the Supreme Court has considered the doctrine of economic duress. The decision has provided a detailed analysis of the law of economic duress, confirmed the existence of lawful act duress, set out its essential elements and given clear guidance on how it should be applied.

While the judgment does confirm that the boundaries of economic duress are not fixed, it is likely to be harder to succeed on lawful act duress claims going forward. Claimants should therefore also consider analogous causes of action, such as undue influence and unconscionable bargains.
