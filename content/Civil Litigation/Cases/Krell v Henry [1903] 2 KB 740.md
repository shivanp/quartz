# Krell v Henry [1903] 2 KB 740

The defendant agreed, by a written contract, to hire a room in a flat on Pall Mall from the plaintiff for two days. The purpose in hiring the room was to view the coronation procession that was to pass along the street below on those days. However, no express mention was made of this in the contract. King Edward VII fell ill and the processions did not go ahead as planned. The Court of Appeal held that the common foundation of the contract was that the room was hired to view the kingâ€™s procession and this purpose had been frustrated. This is a highly unusual case. The rooms were hired out for the day only and both parties understood that the only purpose in hiring the rooms was to have a view of the procession.
