# Cutter v Powell (1796) 6 Term Rep 320

## Facts

Cutter agreed to serve on a ship from Jamaica to Liverpool. The defendant, Powell, agreed in return to pay Cutter 30 guineas (which was four times the going rate) 'provided he proceeds, continues and does his dutyâ€¦ from hence to the port of Liverpool'. Cutter died at sea some seven weeks into the voyage and nineteen days short of Liverpool. Cutter's widow brought an action to recover a proportion of the agreed contract price.

## Held

The action failed. The contract was said to be entire. Cutter was obliged to perform the given duty fully before he could demand payment. Since the contract had not been completely performed, the widow was entitled to nothing.
