# Herne Bay Steamboat Co Ltd v Hutton [1903] 2 KB 683

The plaintiff hired their steamboat to the defendant 'for the purpose of viewing the Naval Review and for a day's cruise round the fleetâ€™ The naval review was cancelled but the cruise could still go ahead. The contract was not frustrated. Viewing the naval fleet might have been the principal motivation for the defendant, but it was not the common foundation of the contract.
