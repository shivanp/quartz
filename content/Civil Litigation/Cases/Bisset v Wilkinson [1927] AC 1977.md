# Bisset v Wilkinson [1927] AC 1977

The claimant agreed to purchase land from the defendant for the purpose of sheep farming. The defendant made a statement that his 'idea was that [the land] would carry two thousand sheep'. The claimant was aware that neither the defendant nor anybody who had owned the land previously had used it for sheep farming. The court held that the statement was merely an opinion that the defendant honestly held, and accordingly the claim for misrepresentation failed.
