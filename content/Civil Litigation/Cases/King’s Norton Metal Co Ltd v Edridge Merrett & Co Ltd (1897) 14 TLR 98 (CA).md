# King’s Norton Metal Co Ltd v Edridge Merrett & Co Ltd (1897) 14 TLR 98 (CA)

The claimant sent goods on credit to Hallam and Co., a fictitious entity, created by the fraudster. The letterhead used by the fraudster gave the impression of a large and successful company. The court held that the mistake made by the original seller in this case was one as to attributes (i.e. the creditworthiness of the fraudster), not identity. Unlike _Cundy v Lindsay_ where the claimants intended to deal with an identifiable third party (Blenkiron & Co. who were known to them) in King’s Norton, the claimants intended to deal with the writer of the letters.
