# Vitol SA v Norelf Ltd, The Santa Clara [1996] 3 All ER 193

## Abstract

N entered into a contract to sell to V goods which were to be shipped from the US. While the vessel was still loading, V sent a telex to N rejecting the cargo and repudiating the contract on the basis that the goods would not be delivered within the timescale agreed in the contract. The vessel completed loading but neither party took further steps to perform the contract. N resold the cargo at a loss and claimed damages from V. The arbitrator held that V's rejection telex was an anticipatory breach of contract and that N's failure to take further steps to perform the contract was sufficient communication to V of the acceptance of the repudiation. N appealed to the House of Lords.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) in some circumstances mere failure by the innocent party to perform his obligations under the repudiated contract was sufficient to amount to acceptance of the repudiation. Communication by oral or written message would not always be necessary. The criteria were whether the innocent party's act and omissions unequivocally conveyed to the party in breach that the innocent party elected to treat the contract as repudiated. Failure to act could be unequivocal, _[State Trading Corp of India Ltd v M Golodetz & Co Inc Ltd [1989] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 277, [1989] 6 WLUK 50](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IBE63FEA0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a38341bd95f048798aa913f7b6ee56fb&contextData=(sc.Default))_ disapproved and

(2) since N was the respondent in the appeal and in a purely defensive position, the Court of Appeal had erred in ruling that N was required to seek a certificate under the [Arbitration Act 1979 s.1(7)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IC988C420E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a38341bd95f048798aa913f7b6ee56fb&contextData=(sc.Default)) before being allowed to argue that the award was sustainable on alternative grounds.
