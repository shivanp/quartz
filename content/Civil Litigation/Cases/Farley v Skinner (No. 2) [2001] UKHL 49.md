# Farley v Skinner (No. 2) [2001] UKHL 49

## Summary

F, who had sued his surveyor for failing to report on aircraft noise in the vicinity of his property, was entitled to recover damages for the physical inconvenience and discomfort that had been caused by the noise.

## Abstract

F appealed against the decision of the Court of Appeal (73 Con. L.R. 70) allowing the appeal of S, a surveyor, against the award of GBP 10,000 made to F by way of damages for the interference with the enjoyment of his property caused by aircraft noise. S, who had been instructed by F to survey the property prior to his purchase of it, and to specifically investigate the likelihood of aircraft noise from a nearby major airport, had negligently concluded that the house was unlikely to be affected.

Held, allowing the appeal, that S's obligation to investigate aircraft noise had been an important part of the contract, and S's failure to properly investigate that aspect had prevented F from making an informed choice as to whether or not to buy the property. That had, in turn, led to mental distress and disappointment for which damages had been sought.

The guidance in _[Watts v Morrow [1991] 1 W.L.R. 1421, [1991] 7 WLUK 395](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF1043321E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e49227d414064b4da008c552e0c86d72&contextData=(sc.Default))_ was still valuable in the context of determining whether damages were available for breach of contract, but there was no reason in principle and policy why the scope of recovery in the exceptional category should be dependent on the object of the contract as ascertained from all its constituent parts. It was enough that an important object of the contract had been to give “pleasure, relaxation or peace of mind” and that it had been breached, Watts considered, _[Knott v Bolton 45 Con. L.R. 127, [1995] 3 WLUK 339](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6D436070E43611DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e49227d414064b4da008c552e0c86d72&contextData=(sc.Default))_ overruled.

F had not forfeited his right to damages by remaining at the property, given that he had acted reasonably in making the best of the situation, and that his decision not to move had prevented a larger claim against S.
