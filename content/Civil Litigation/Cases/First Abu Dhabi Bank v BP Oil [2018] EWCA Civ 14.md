# First Abu Dhabi Bank v BP Oil [2018] EWCA Civ 14

## Summary

A creditor which had sold a bank 95% of a receivable representing an obligation owed by a third party to pay for a delivery of crude oil was not in breach of a warranty which it had given the bank to the effect that it was not prohibited from disposing of the receivable. On a proper construction of the warranty, a clause in the agreement between the creditor and debtor restricting their ability to assign any of their rights or obligations under the agreement did not put the creditor in breach.

## Abstract

An oil company appealed against a decision giving judgment to a bank on its claim for damages for breach of warranty and breach of representation.

The company had entered into an agreement with a third party (the debtor) for the sale and purchase of crude oil. The agreement, which was expressly subject to English law, incorporated the company's general terms and conditions. Section 34 of those terms and conditions prohibited either party from assigning any of their rights or obligations under the agreement without the consent of the other. By a purchase letter, the bank bought 95% of the receivable evidenced by the company's invoice to the debtor. Clause 3(iv) of the letter obliged the company to assign its rights, title, interest and claims against the debtor to the bank, and by cl.3(v) the company agreed that by selling the receivable it had assigned its discount percent to the bank “in equity irrevocably … subject to the terms hereof”. By cl.5(b), it represented and warranted that it was not prohibited "by any security, loan or other agreement … from disposing of the receivable evidenced by the invoice as contemplated herein".

The company did not obtain the debtor's consent to any assignment. The debtor became insolvent and the bank received no payment. It therefore brought proceedings against the company and obtained judgment on the basis that the s.34 prohibition meant that its representation and warranty in cl.5(b) were false.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

**What did s.34 prohibit the company from doing?** Section 34 meant that the company, as creditor, was contractually prohibited, vis-à-vis the debtor, from effecting a legal or equitable assignment of the discount percent of the receivable without the debtor's prior consent. It did not prevent the disposal to the bank of sums received by the company from the debtor, because such sums were not rights under the agreement. Nor did it prevent the company from creating a trust over the receivable or its proceeds, or from creating rights of subrogation or sub-participation (see paras [23-26](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of the judgment).

**What was the effect of that restriction on the company's ability to dispose of the receivable?** The company did not seek to argue that, as a matter of law, s.34 could not invalidate an equitable assignment as between it and the bank. Such an argument would have involved the court considering whether the binding decision in _[Linden Gardens Trust Ltd v Lenesta Sludge Disposal Ltd [1994] 1 A.C. 85, [1993] 7 WLUK 264](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE0FFD110E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c794e5e6819441d6b462a21b39943bad&contextData=(sc.Default))_ could be distinguished. The proper construction of s.34 therefore had to be considered on the assumption that any purported equitable assignment without the debtor's prior consent would be invalid, Linden followed (paras [27-30](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Was the company in breach of the representation and warranty in cl.5(b)?** No. The company was not prohibited by any agreement from disposing of the receivable in the manner contemplated in the purchase letter. At the date of the purchase letter, there was in force a payment guarantee entered into by the company and the bank. That guarantee provided for the possibility that there might be a contractual restriction on the assignment of rights under the agreement. Thus, the possibility that it might be necessary to find alternative ways of transferring the economic benefit of the discount percent of the receivable was part of the factual matrix against which the letter fell to be construed.

Secondly, the letter contemplated that the primary means of transferring the economic benefit was by the company paying the bank the relevant amount out of the sums it received from the debtor, with a trust imposed on the receipts in the meantime. The assignment only took effect to the extent that sums had not been received or paid over. Thirdly, there was no reason why the cl.3(iv) obligation to assign should be confined to legal assignment. Fourthly, the agreement in cl.3(v) that the company had assigned the discount percent of the receivable "in equity irrevocably" to the bank was expressly subject to the foregoing sub-clauses, which contemplated that an assignment might not be able to take place, might not be legally possible, or might be invalid or unenforceable, in which case alternative remedies and rights were afforded to the bank (paras [31-40](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")). There was force in the company's argument that the words "or other agreement" in cl.5(b) should be construed as not including the agreement between itself and the debtor, either on the application of the noscitur a sociis rule of construction or on the ground that the contract was a defined term which should have been mentioned if it was meant to have been a relevant agreement.

More importantly, the phrase "from disposing of the receivable evidenced by the invoice as contemplated herein" envisaged a restriction preventing the disposal or sale of the company's entitlement to receive the invoice value on the repayment date in the manner contemplated in the purchase letter. Since that letter contemplated that equitable assignment might not be possible and provided for other means of transferring the economic benefit, there was no basis for construing the words “disposing” or “sale” as referring exclusively to equitable assignment. The commercial reality was that s.34 did not prohibit the disposal of the receivable or its discount percent in the manner contemplated in the purchase letter. There was therefore no breach of the warranty in cl.5(b) (paras [41-42](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
