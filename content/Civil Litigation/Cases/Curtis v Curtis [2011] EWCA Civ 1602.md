# Curtis v Curtis [2011] EWCA Civ 1602

## Summary

A judge had been entitled to find that the signature of the claimant on a deed transferring his interest in his home to a charitable trust offering spiritual healing had been obtained by undue influence.

## Abstract

The appellant charitable trust (T) appealed against a decision that the signature of the respondent (C) on a deed headed "Agreement for donating property to the Self Realisation Mediation Healing Centre Charitable Trust" had been procured by reason of undue influence on T's part.

The property in question had been C's matrimonial home. T offered meditation and courses, including natural spiritual healing, progressive counselling and coaching, retreats, spiritual gatherings and yoga classes. After retiring, C started attending courses and counselling run by T. He and his wife became very close to T's founder and spiritual head.

The possibility of their home being used as what was called a sister centre was considered in 2003. A meeting took place in that connection in January 2004 where the possibility was discussed in some detail. The upshot was that the deed was executed. Its effect was that the property became held on trust solely and beneficially for T. C and his wife remained living there, operating the property as a sister centre. T paid off the mortgage and, either directly or through others, paid for improvements to the property. C brought proceedings several years later against T, alleging that he had signed the deed as a result of undue influence.

The judge upheld the claim, finding that the nature of the relationship between T and C was such that, coupled with the fact that the transaction recorded in the deed was manifestly to C's disadvantage, a presumption arose that his signature had been obtained under undue influence. The judge concluded that T, through its servants and agents, had been in the position of a spiritual adviser to C.

T argued that  
(1) the judge had been wrong to find that it had not discharged the burden of rebutting the presumption of undue influence: for example, C was a man of maturity, intelligence and self-assurance; further, he had been given ample time to reflect on the signing of the deed;  
(2) the judge had also been wrong to reject its argument that C's claim should be defeated on the ground of laches.

## Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) The judge's decision that T had not rebutted the presumption of undue influence was one that he had been entitled to reach. It could not be said that he failed to take into account any relevant factor, wrongly took into account an irrelevant factor or reached a conclusion that no reasonable judge would have reached (see paras [18-19](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).  
(2) Although C had made no complaint about having signed the deed until he left the property some four-and-a-half years later, the judge found that he was still under the influence of T and still following the teaching of its founder. Given that finding, T's argument of laches was bound to fail (paras [20, 22](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
