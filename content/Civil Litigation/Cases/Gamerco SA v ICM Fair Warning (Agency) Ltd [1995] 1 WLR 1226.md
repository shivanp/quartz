# Gamerco SA v ICM Fair Warning (Agency) Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 1226

#key-case

Mr Justice Garland's held that the burden of proof is on the payee (the party seeking to retain or recover their expenses from the sum of money paid or payable in advance) to show that it is 'just' for him so to do. As to how much, he held that the court has a 'broad discretion' and:

> “It is self-evident that any rigid rule is liable to produce injustice. The words, 'if it considers it just to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the case' clearly confer a very broad discretion. Obviously the court must not take into account anything which is not 'a circumstance of the case' or fail to take into account anything that is and then exercise its discretion rationally. I see no indication… that the court is obliged to incline towards either total retention or equal division. Its task is to do justice in a situation which the parties had neither contemplated nor provided for, and to mitigate the possible harshness of allowing all loss to lie where it has fallen.”

## Abstract

G agreed to promote M's rock concert at a Madrid stadium. A few days before the concert date, engineers reported the need for safety investigations and the authorities banned the use of the stadium, revoking G's licence to hold the event. G had paid M money on account, and both G and M had incurred expenses. G sought to recover the advance payment under the [Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 s.1(2)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I483322E1E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=f5afd174ce1a49f0b12c2ce2036095ea&contextData=(sc.Default)) and M counterclaimed for damages for breach of contract for failure to secure the permit.

Held, allowing the claim and dismissing the counterclaim, that

(1) to give the contract commercial efficacy, a term was to be implied that G would use all reasonable endeavours to obtain a permit, but they were not obliged to ensure that it remained in force;  
(2) the contract was frustrated as M was unable to perform their obligation not because the permit was revoked, but because the use of the stadium was banned, and so G was able to recover the advance payment under the 1943 Act and  
(3) the proviso to s.1(2) entitled the court to deduct M's expenses, but having regard to G's loss, justice was best served by making no deduction.
