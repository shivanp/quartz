# Errington v Errington & Wood [1952] 1 KB 290

 A father agreed to give his house to his son and daughter-in-law if they paid off the mortgage on the house. The act required of the couple was therefore paying off a building society mortgage loan. The couple had made several payments towards paying off the loan when the father sought to revoke the offer. The court held that the promise could not be revoked after the couple had started to pay the instalments and as long as they continued to be paid.
