# Hoenig v Isaacs [1952] 2 ALL ER 176

## Facts

Hoenig agreed to redecorate completely and refurnish Isaacs’ one-bedroom flat. Hoenig finished the work, but the job had some defects which would require further attention, e.g. the wardrobe he fitted needed a new door, and the built-in bookcase was slightly too short for the space. The total value of the work was around £750 and the repairs would cost around £55. Hoenig sued for payment but admitted that Isaacs was entitled to reduce the payment to reflect the cost of repairs. Isaacs said that entire performance was a condition precedent to any payment, and therefore, following _Sumpter,_ he only had to pay a _quantum meruit_ (in return for taking the benefit of the work).

## Held

In this case, the contract had been substantially performed, and all that was left were 'defects and omissions'. These did not go to the root of the contract. Hoenig was therefore entitled to the contract price, less a deduction for the defects (probably calculated as the cost of remedying the defects).
