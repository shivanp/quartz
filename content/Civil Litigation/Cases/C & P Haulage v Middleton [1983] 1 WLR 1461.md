# C & P Haulage v Middleton [1983] 1 WLR 1461

## Facts

C & P Haulage contracted to allow Mr Middleton to use their premises for a vehicle repair business. Under the terms of the agreement:

(i) Mr Middleton’s licence was renewable every six months, and could be cancelled with one month’s notice, and  
(ii) any fixtures put into the premises by Mr Middleton were to be left on the premises.

Mr Middleton carried out substantial work on the premises to make them suitable for use as a garage. The parties fell out and, on 5 October 1979, Mr Middleton was ejected from the premises and had to carry on his business from the garage at his house. Mr Middleton claimed £1,767.51 damages, to cover the money spent on putting the premises in a fit state to use as a garage (i.e., damages based on his reliance interest).

## Held

It was accepted by Mr Middleton that, under the contract, he was not entitled to take out any of the fixtures he had installed. He would not have been entitled to payment for the work he had done in relation to the premises. He also accepted that the agreement could have been lawfully terminated ten weeks after it was actually ended.

> “The present case seems to me to be quite different both from Anglia Television Ltd. v. Reed […] in that while it is true that the expenditure could in a sense be said to be wasted in consequence of the breach of contract, it was equally likely to be wasted if there had been no breach, because the plaintiffs wanted to get the defendant out and could terminate the licence at quite short notice. A high risk of waste was from the very first, inherent in the nature of the contract itself, breach or no breach. The reality of the matter is that the waste resulted from what was, on the defendant's side, a very unsatisfactory and dangerous bargain.
>
> […] an aggrieved party cannot recover for expenses that would have been wasted whether or not the breach of contract occurred. The losses must flow from the breach, not from making a bad bargain. […] Mr Middleton had made a bad deal – he spent a great deal of money improving premises that he had only a limited right to occupy. Mr Middleton was only entitled to stay for six months at a time, and had no right under the contract for compensation for the money he spent improving the premises, as […] all fixtures and fittings were to be left on the premises. Mr Middleton’s loss therefore came from making a bad bargain, not from the breach.
>
> […]no award of damages can put the claimant in a better position than he would have been in had the contract been performed. “
