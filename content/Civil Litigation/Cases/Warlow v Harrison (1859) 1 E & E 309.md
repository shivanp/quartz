# Warlow v Harrison (1859) 1 E & E 309

## Facts:

A public auction of a horse, without reserve, was advertised by the defendant, an auctioneer. The plaintiff bid 60 guineas and the owner of the horse bid 61 guineas. There were no further bids and the defendant put down his hammer on the bid for 61 guineas. The plaintiff claimed the horse should be his as he was the highest bona fide bidder.

## Issue:

Was there a contract for sale?

## Held:

The advertisement , as it included the words without reserve, was an offer to sell to the highest bona fide bidder. The defendant was in breach of that promise. It was an offer of a unilateral contract as the defendant bound himself to sell to the highest bidder.

The plaintiff had performed the required act (made the highest bid). However, because the hammer had not been put down on the plaintiff's bid there was no acceptance of his offer. Therefore, there was no contract for the sale.

The plaintiff was only entitled to sue the defendant for the loss of the opportunity to buy the horse.
