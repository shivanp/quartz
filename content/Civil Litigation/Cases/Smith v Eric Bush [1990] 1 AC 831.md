# Smith v Eric Bush [1990] 1 AC 831

#key-case

## Facts

The Defendant, Eric Bush, was a surveyor who was employed by Abbey National to assess the value of a property which was to be purchased by the Claimant, Mrs Smith. Mrs Smith had paid Abbey National for Mr Bush’s work to be carried out. Mr Bush’s report stated that the property was not in need of any essential repairs. This was not correct, as it turned out that the property had suffered structural damage. The Claimant bought the property in reliance on this report, but eventually part of the chimney collapsed and broke through the roof into the property’s loft. The Claimant and the Defendant did not have a contract between themselves (there was only a relationship between Abbey National and each of the Claimant and the Defendant). What is more, the contract between Abbey National and the Claimant included an exemption clause which specifically exempted the Defendant from liability for his report. The Claimant argued both in contract and tort; first that the exemption clause was unreasonable for the purposes of sections 2(2) and 13(1) of the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] and second that there was that the Defendant owed the Claimant a duty of care in tort.

## Issues

The issues in this case were three: first, whether there was a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill incumbent on the valuer in tort; second, whether the exemption clause in the contract falls under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and third, whether relying on that exemption clause is fair and reasonable for the purposes of the Act.

## Decision / Outcome

The court held that the exemption clause was unreasonable for the purposes of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. It was of particular note that this was a low value property to be used as a dwelling, and that it was common practice for purchasers to rely on valuations in making such decisions. Where the property is to be an investment or to be used as a business or whether it was of higher value, an exemption clause of this nature could be reasonable.

The defendant surveyor (who provided a survey to the claimant’s lender) owed the claimant a duty of care for the pure economic loss caused by the negligent survey because:

1. she was a first-time buyer (and so did not know she ought to get an independent structural survey); and
2. was purchasing a house of modest value.

The defendant should therefore have known that the claimant would rely on their survey, and this reliance was reasonable. It was foreseeable to the defendant that if they provided incorrect advice, the claimant would suffer a loss.

The survey included a disclaimer. However, under **s.2(2) of UCTA 1977** the disclaimer was invalid as it was unreasonable.

The House of Lords listed factors which should be taken into account when deciding if a disclaimer is reasonable:

1. Were the parties of **equal bargaining power**?
2. Would it have been reasonably **practicable** to obtain **advice from an alternative source** considering cost and time?
3. How **difficult was the task** being undertaken by the defendant?
4. What are the **practical consequences**, taking into account the sums of money at stake and the ability of the parties to bear the loss involved, particularly in light of insurance?

**Held:**

Applying the facts, the disclaimer was unreasonable. The parties were not of equal bargaining power. It was **not reasonably practicable** for the claimant to obtain an independent structural survey, as these are expensive, and she was purchasing a house of modest value. The claimant was a person of modest means, making the most expensive investment of her life. The **defendant was in a better position** to bear the financial loss.
