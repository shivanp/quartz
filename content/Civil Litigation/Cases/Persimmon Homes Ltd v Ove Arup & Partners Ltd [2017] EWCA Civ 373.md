# Persimmon Homes Ltd v Ove Arup & Partners Ltd [2017] EWCA Civ 373

## Facts

The claimant purchased a site adjacent to some docks for commercial and residential development. In 2009, they contracted with the defendant to provide engineering and environmental services for the project. Clause 6.3 of the contract limited the defendant’s liability for tort, contract or breach of statutory duty to £12 million. It also limited pollution and contamination liability to £5 million, and excluded liability for any claim relating to asbestos.

In 2012, the claimant’s ground-works contractor encountered asbestos on the site, in a quantity substantially higher than expected. They sued the defendant for breach of contract, negligence, and breach of statutory duty, arguing that the defendant failed to identify and report on the asbestos. The defendant relied on clause 6.3 as excluding their liability in relation to these claims. The claimant responded that clause 6.3, properly construed, applied only to claims relating to the spread or causation of asbestos. It did not apply to the failure to identify or report asbestos.

## Issue(s)

    How should clause 6.3 be construed?

## Decision

The Court of Appeal held in favour of the defendant. Clause 6.3’s language plainly showed the parties intended to exclude liability for all asbestos related claims, not just a limited class. Business common sense did not contradict this.

## This Case is Authority For…

The 3-stage test in The Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v King [1952] AC 192 is merely guidelines rather than a strict test. In commercial cases, it is normally more help in construing indemnity clauses, rather than exclusion clauses. This is because commercial contracts often deliberately use exemption clauses to distribute risk. There is no need to have any presumption that they should be narrowly construed. In any case, the court thought that the 3-stage test was met in the present case.

The court declined to apply the contra proferentem rule. This rule holds that ambiguous clauses should be construed against the person attempting to rely on them. The court thought that the rule had little application in interpreting commercial contracts negotiated between parties of equal bargaining power.

### Summary

In relation to commercial contracts negotiated between parties of equal bargaining power, the contra proferentem rule, requiring any ambiguity in an exemption clause to be resolved against the party who put the clause forward and relied on it, now had a very limited role, and the guidelines on exemption clauses stemming from _[Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v King, The [1952] A.C. 192, [1952] 1 WLUK 480](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I81886CB0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71d0adbfd1a94a78ac9c1a5a29af0b4c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ espousing the contra proferentem rule, in so far as they survived, were now more relevant to indemnity clauses than to exemption clauses.

### Abstract

The appellant development consortium appealed against a decision that the respondent engineers were exempt from liability for unexpected quantities of asbestos found on a development site.

The consortium had engaged the respondents to provide consultant engineering services in relation to their bid for the site of former docks for a commercial and residential development. Their bid was accepted and, under a 2009 agreement, the consortium appointed the respondents to provide further professional services. The agreement contained deeds of warranty by which the respondents agreed that they had performed and would continue to perform their duties with the professionally expected degree of reasonable skill and care.

Clause 4.3 of the warranties provided that the respondents' liability for pollution and contamination was limited to £5 million in aggregate, and that liability for any claim in relation to asbestos was excluded. The consortium also engaged the services of other consultants and specialist contractors and one of them subsequently encountered asbestos at the site. The consortium maintained that the respondents had been negligent in failing to identify and report on it at an earlier stage. They commenced proceedings seeking damages for breach of contract, tort and breach of statutory duty, based on their alleged loss derived from paying too high a purchase price for the site, and incurring additional costs.

The respondents contended that their liability, if any, in respect of the asbestos was excluded by cl.4.3. That matter was tried as a preliminary issue. The judge found that the exemption clause represented an agreed allocation of risk between the parties, that its meaning was clear, and that the court should give effect to that meaning.

The consortium contended that

(1) the phrase "liability for pollution and contamination" in cl.4.3 meant "liability for causing pollution and contamination" rather than any liability in connection with pollution and contamination, and that the phrase "liability for any claim in relation to asbestos" should be construed in the same way: the respondents' liability was thereby only excluded for any claim against them for causing the presence of asbestos;

(2) the judge had erred in failing to apply the contra proferentem rule, requiring any ambiguity in an exemption clause to be resolved against the party who put the clause forward and relied on it, in accordance with the long line of authorities on exemption clauses starting with _[Canada Steamship Lines Ltd v King, The [1952] A.C. 192, [1952] 1 WLUK 480](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I81886CB0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71d0adbfd1a94a78ac9c1a5a29af0b4c&contextData=(sc.Default))_.

### Held

Appeal dismissed.

(1) On its natural meaning, cl.4.3 excluded any claim relating to asbestos, not only claims for causing the spread of asbestos. If, as the consortium contended, the word "for" meant "for causing", the last sentence of cl.4.3 became bizarre, if not ungrammatical: one could not sensibly read it as saying that "Liability for causing any claim in relation to asbestos is excluded." It would be nonsensical for the parties to agree that the respondents were not liable if asbestos was moved from one part of the site to another, but were liable if it was left in place. Both the language used by the parties and any application of business common sense led to conclusion that the respondents were exempted from liability for any claims relating to asbestos: cl.4.3 was not limited to claims for causing the spread of asbestos (see paras [48-50](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) In relation to commercial contracts negotiated between parties of equal bargaining power, the **contra proferentem rule now had a very limited role**, _[K/S Victoria Street v House of Fraser (Stores Management) Ltd [2011] EWCA Civ 904, [2012] Ch. 497, [2011] 7 WLUK 805](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IE1FAB220B8A611E08E89E51884D3FC3D/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71d0adbfd1a94a78ac9c1a5a29af0b4c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Transocean Drilling UK Ltd v Providence Resources Plc [2016] EWCA Civ 372, [2016] 2 All E.R.

Since the enactment of the [Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I60439100E42311DAA7CF8F68F6EE57AB/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71d0adbfd1a94a78ac9c1a5a29af0b4c&contextData=(sc.Default)), the courts had softened in their approach to both indemnity and exemption clauses, _[Lictor Anstalt v Mir Steel UK Ltd [2012] EWCA Civ 1397, [2013] 2 All E.R. (Comm) 54, [2012] 11 WLUK 31](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF7646ED0248911E2889C81A0EF9CE555/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=71d0adbfd1a94a78ac9c1a5a29af0b4c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. In major construction projects, the parties commonly agreed how to allocate the risks between themselves and who would insure against what. Exemption clauses were part of the contractual apparatus for distributing risk: there was no need to approach them with horror or a mindset designed to cut them down.

Although the instant judgment was not the place for a general review of commercial contract law, the Canada Steamships guidelines espousing the contra proferentem rule, in so far as they survived, were now more relevant to indemnity clauses than to exemption clauses, and were of very little assistance in the instant case, Canada Steamships considered. The meaning of cl.4.3 was clear, and neither the contra proferentem rule nor the case law on exemption clauses could rescue the consortium. The warranties excluded liability for all the consortium's pleaded claims in respect of asbestos (paras [52-62](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
