# Stewart Gill Ltd v Horatio Myer & Co. Ltd [1992] 1 QB 600

A term in a contract which includes a prohibition on a payment or credit being set off against the price claimed is prima facie unreasonable.

D entered into a contract with P for the supply and installation of goods, payment for which was to be in stages, the last of which was 30 days after completion. The contract incorporated P's general conditions of sale, one term of which provided that "the customer shall not be entitled to withhold payment of any amount due to the Company under the Contract by reason of any payment credit set-off counterclaim". D withheld some of the price on completion. P brought an action to recover the sum due and applied for summary judgment. D opposed the application, alleging breaches of contract which gave rise to a set-off. The judge granted unconditional leave to defend on the ground that P could not rely on the term because it was unreasonable.

Held, dismissing P's appeal, that a term in a contract which prevented a payment or credit from being set off against the price claimed was prima facie unreasonable and the burden of proving otherwise rested with P. When considering reasonableness, the whole of the term had to be considered, not just that part relied upon by P. Accordingly, the whole of the term was unenforceable.
