# Petrotrade Inc v Texaco Ltd [1999] 12 WLUK 745

P sought summary judgment for the outstanding balance on a cargo of diesel oil, which T had deducted from the full price following allegations that the cargo was off-specification. P contended a no set-off clause and a clause whereby the parties would be bound on any issues of specification by the determination of a third party had been incorporated into the contract by an established course of trading. The court ruled that the clauses had been so incorporated and that the third party had made a compliant decision, thus providing T with no defence to the action.
