# Taylor v Caldwell (1863) 3 B & S 826

The defendants granted the claimants a licence to use its music hall at a cost of Â£100 per concert. After the contract had been entered into but before the first performance, the music hall was destroyed. No provision had been made for this risk in the contract. The court held that the contract was frustrated due to the destruction of the music hall, rendering it impossible to continue with the contract.
