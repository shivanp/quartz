# Edwinton Commercial Corporation v Tsavliris Russ (Worldwide Salvage & Towage) Ltd, The Sea Angel [2007] EWCA Civ 547

The court considered whether a delay of some three or so months towards the end of a short (20 day) time charter, caused by reason of the unlawful detention of the vessel by port authorities, in a salvage context, has frustrated that charter.

The Court of Appeal decided that where a ship, with three days remaining on a 20-day time charter, was detained unreasonably by port authorities for over four months, the charterparty was not frustrated and the charterers remained liable for the payment of hire until the ship was redelivered. The general risk of detention by port authorities was a foreseeable risk of the industry, even though its particular manifestation in this case was unforeseen and even unprecedented, and given that under a time charter, the charterer assumed the risk of delay, it would be inconsistent with the demands of justice, on which the doctrine of frustration was based, to reverse this contractual risk.
