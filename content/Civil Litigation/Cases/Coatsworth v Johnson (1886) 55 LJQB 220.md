# Coatsworth v Johnson (1886) 55 LJQB 220

The tenant sought specific performance of his landlordâ€™s agreement to grant him a lease.  

Held: The tenant was in breach of a covenant in the intended lease. Specific performance is discretionary, and a court under equity will require a party seeking an equitable remedy to come with clean hands.
