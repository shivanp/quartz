# Gordon v Selico (1986) 278 EG 53

## Facts

The claimant purchased a long lease of a flat from the first defendant and of which the second defendant was the managing agent. The flats were already in poor repair at the time of the purchase, and subsequently the second defendant made no attempts to fulfil its maintenance obligations. The building was ultimately found to be badly affected by dry rot and the local authority served a dangerous structure notice. The claimant sought damages for deceit on the basis that a contractor had fraudulently hidden details of the dry rot at the time of the purchase when carrying out work ordered by the second defendant on the first defendant’s behalf. This claim was successful at first instance, and the judge also found that the defendants were both in breach of their maintenance obligations under the **Housing Act 1974**. The defendants did not appeal on the basis that there had been no deceit, but rather that this should not be imputed on them.

## Issues

The issue in this context was whether the deceit of the contractor instructed and employed by the defendants could be imputed on them.

## Decision/Outcome

The Court of Appeal dismissed the defendants’ appeal, but on different grounds from those found at first instance. The second defendant had become a party to the contractor’s fraudulent [[Misrepresentation]] as a result of its controlling shareholding in the property, and the authority for this was conferred on the second defendant by the first. The defendants were therefore liable for this fraudulent [[Misrepresentation]]. The defendants were also found to be in breach of their maintenance obligations under the lease. The court ordered damages in respect of both areas of the claim, together with the making of orders for specific performance to be worked out by the Chief Chancery Master.

## Abstract

P purchased a long lease in a block of flats of which D2, a firm of estate agents, acted as managing agents. The building was already badly maintained at the date of the purchase, and D1 and D2 subsequently made no attempt to operate the system of maintenance provided in the lease. The building was eventually found to be badly affected by dry rot, originating from the incursion of water. The local authority served a dangerous structure notice and obtained a magistrates' court order. When this was not complied with, it instructed builders to do the works. The judge held that D1 was liable to P in damages for deceit, because there had been at the time of the purchase a fraudulent concealment of dry rot by A, a building contractor, in the course of work ordered by D2 on D1's behalf. He further found that D1 and D2 were in breach of their respective maintenance obligations under the lease, and made an order for specific performance under s.125 of the Housing Act 1974. He also awarded nominal damages in respect of the breaches. On appeal, D1 and D2 did not contest the finding that A had been fraudulent and was liable in deceit, but argued that his conduct was not to be imputed to them.

Held, dismissing the appeal and affirming the judge's decision on different grounds, that

(1) D2 had, through its controlling shareholder, become party to A's fraudulent misrepresentation;  
(2) A's fraudulent misrepresentation was within the actual or ostensible authority conferred on D2 by D1;  
(3) the judge had correctly found D1 and D2 to be in breach of their respective maintenance obligations, in respect of which they had covenanted in the lease to act as trustees;  
(4) the court would order the payments of damages for deceit and breach of covenant, together with the execution of the maintenance trusts of the lease and specific performance of the lessor's covenants pursuant to the [Housing Act 1974 s.125](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I4BDDBEE0E44911DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a518abef54954df1bdae722ba5704919&contextData=(sc.Default));  
(5) all details of the various orders were to be worked out by the Chief Chancery Master.
