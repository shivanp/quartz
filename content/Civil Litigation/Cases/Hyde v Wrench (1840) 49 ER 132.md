# Hyde v Wrench (1840) 49 ER 132

## Facts of Hyde V Wrench

The defendant, Mr Wrench, offered to sell the farm he owned to the complainant, Mr Hyde. He offered to sell the property for £1,200, but this was declined by Mr Hyde. The defendant decided to write to the complainant with another offer; this time to sell the farm to him for £1,000. He made it clear that this would be his final offer regarding the property. In response, Mr Hyde offered £950 for the farm in his letter. This was refused by Mr Wrench and he confirmed this with the complainant. Mr Hyde then agreed to buy the farm for £1,000, which was the sum that had previously been offered.  However, Mr Wrench refused to sell his farm.

## Issues in Hyde V Wrench

The complainant brought an action for specific performance, claiming that as Mr Wrench refused to sell the farm, this was a breach of contract. The issue in this case was whether there was a valid contract between the parties and if a counter offer was made in discussions, whether the original offer would still remain open.

## Decision / Outcome of Hyde V Wrench

The court dismissed the claims and held that there was no binding contract for the farm between Mr Hyde and Mr Wrench. It was stated that when a counter offer is made, this supersedes and destroys the original offer. This original offer is no longer available or on the table. In this case, when Mr Hyde offered £950, he cancelled the £1,000 offer and could not back track and accept.

# Ratios

- A valid acceptance must be unconditional
- A counter offer must propose alternative terms for acceptance
