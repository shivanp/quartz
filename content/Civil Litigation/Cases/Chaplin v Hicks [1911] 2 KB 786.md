# Chaplin v Hicks [1911] 2 KB 786

The defendant, Hicks, was a theatre producer. He advertised a competition in a national newspaper for young women to send in photographs to be shortlisted by readers for a prize. The winner of the competition would be offered a part in one of the defendant's plays. Six thousand photographs were sent in, each woman paying one shilling to take part in the competition. For the purposes of the competition, the country was divided into four areas, and the winners from each were to attend the final round.

The claimant, Chaplin, came top in her area but was only informed of this at a very late stage, and was then unable to attend the final round. She sued for loss of the chance to win the competition. The jury awarded her Â£100 to represent her loss of chance, and the Court of Appeal upheld the award.
