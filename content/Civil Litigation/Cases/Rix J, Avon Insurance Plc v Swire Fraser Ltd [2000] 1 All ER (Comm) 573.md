# Rix J, Avon Insurance Plc v Swire Fraser Ltd [2000] 1 All ER (Comm) 573

## Facts

The claimant was a stop loss insurance company which made a claim against the defendant insurance brokers under the **Misrepresentation Act 1967** on the basis that it had been induced into the contract by assurances made by the defendant as to how the risk of each potential insured party was to be assessed. The claimants asserted that a booklet produced by the defendant stated that each insured party would be individually assessed by the defendantâ€™s lead underwriter in accordance with the stated underwriting criteria. The claims were not assessed individually in this manner and the claimant sought damages at the rate available in fraud. The defendant asserted that damages were calculable at the same rate as in negligent misrepresentation.

## Issue

The issue in this context was whether the contents of the booklet and the manner in which the risks were assessed for underwriting constituted a misrepresentation.

## Decision/Outcome

It was held that the booklet did not constitute a misrepresentation. The fact that the risks were assessed by a team under the control of the head underwriter was not a significant departure from the words of the booklet. The representation was true, even though it did not exactly match the terms of the booklet. In any event, this point alone, had not been the primary inducement to the claimant to enter into the agreement and therefore there was no misrepresentation. If there had been, the correct calculation of damages was on the fraud basis and therefore, the court should take care in finding that a misrepresentation had occurred.

## Summary

AI, insurance providers for Lloyd's names, brought claims of innocent misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s2(1) against SF, brokers that AI had authorised to issue and bind policies. AI contended that they had entered into a contract with SF in reliance upon the misrepresentation, and they claimed damages under the tortious measure for fraud, whereas SF reserved the right to claim that the measure of loss ought to be the same as that for negligent misrepresentation. Concluding that, as the prevailing law was that any misrepresentation inducing a contract invited damages upon the fraud basis, then misrepresentations should not be too easily found, the court held that AI had failed to prove the misrepresentations, and that, even if the misrepresentations had existed, they would not have materially induced SF to take part in the scheme, hence there was no entitlement to damages.

## Abstract

A, a company of stop loss insurers, made a claim against SF, insurance brokers, pursuant to the [Misrepresentation Act 1967 s.2(1)](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICA020840E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9db4d675b41a415cb9071b813a8de271&contextData=(sc.Default)). A maintained that material misrepresentations had been made to it in a booklet written by SF, which had induced A to become the stop loss insurer for a large number of Lloyd's Names. A contended that the misrepresentation arose from a statement that SF's lead underwriter, B, would individually assess each of the Names proposing to take out stop loss cover, in accordance with the stated underwriting criteria, when, in fact, he did not do so. A claimed the same measure of damages as that available in fraud, _[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson [1991] 2 Q.B. 297, [1991] 3 WLUK 328](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I908D8730E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=9db4d675b41a415cb9071b813a8de271&contextData=(sc.Default))_ cited. SF reserved the right to submit that damages for innocent misrepresentation under s.2(1) of the Act were to be calculated in the same measure as those for negligent misrepresentation.

Held, giving judgment for the defendant, that

(1) on the evidence, each risk had been individually assessed and rated. The fact that parts of the process had been delegated to deputies under B's supervision was an inevitable outcome of a process which had been formulated in order to cope with large and increasing numbers of proposals. Overall control of the system had, nevertheless, always remained with B; hence the overall procedure had not been inconsistent with the claims made in the booklet and there was no misrepresentation, and

(2) there was little substance to the allegations that the risk had not been assessed in accordance with the stated underwriting criteria. SF's representation was to be construed broadly and, looking at it from that perspective, it had been substantially correct. A representation could be true even if it was not entirely correct, so long as the difference between what was represented and what was correct was not, alone, responsible for inducing the claimant to enter into the contract. A failure in respect of an isolated aspect of the risks assessment was not likely to have influenced A, especially as the ultimate significance of the criteria was to achieve a well spread book of business, and that result had been achieved. The law provided that damages assessed upon the fraud basis were to be awarded where a misrepresentation had induced a contract, Royscot applied. It, therefore, followed that the court should take care in finding that a misrepresentation had occurred.
