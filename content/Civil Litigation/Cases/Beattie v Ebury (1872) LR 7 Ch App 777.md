# Beattie v Ebury (1872) LR 7 Ch App 777

Directors of a company are not personally liable to find cash for cheques drawn by them as officers of the company upon the company's bank, and which the bank may choose to honour when the company has no funds at the bank. A letter written by such directors, at a time when the company has funds at the bank, requesting the bankers to honour cheques of the company drawn in a particular manner, is only an intimation not to treat cheques as cheques of the company, unless signed in that manner; it is not any representation either of any authority in the directors to overdraw the account or that there will be funds forthcoming to answer the cheques, and it does not imply any undertaking on the part of any director signing it that he will personally pay or be answerable for any cheques, though drawn in that particular manner, if they should not be paid by the company. As neither the directors who signed such letter nor those who, by cheques drawn in conformity therewith, subsequently overdraw the account incur any personal liability, so neither do such directors as at subsequent meetings confirm the letter, or acquiesce in the cheques drawn in conformity with it.

Directors of a company held not to be personally liable to find cash for cheques drawn by them as officers of their company upon their company’s bank, and which the bank honoured when the company had no funds at the bank, by reason of a letter written by such directors, at a time when the company had funds at the bank, requesting the bankers to honour cheques of the company drawn in a particular manner, such letter being only an intimation not to treat cheques as cheques of the company, unless signed in that manner; such a letter is not any representation either of any authority in the directors to overdraw the account or that there will be funds forthcoming to answer the cheques, and it does not imply any undertaking on the part of any of the directors signing it that he will personally pay or be answerable for any cheques, though drawn in that particular manner, if they should not be paid by the company.  

  

As neither the directors, who signed such letter, nor those who, by cheques drawn in conformity therewith, subsequently overdrew the account, incurred any personal liability, so neither did such factors as at subsequent meetings confirmed the letter, or acquiesced in the cheques drawn in conformity with it.

Directors of a company are not personally liable to find cash for cheques drawn by them as officers of their company upon their company’s bank, and which the bank honoured when the company had no funds at the bank, by reason of a letter written by such directors, at a time when the company had funds at the bank, requesting the bankers to honour cheques of the company drawn in a particular manner, such letter being only an intention not to treat cheques as cheques of the company, unless signed in that manner; such a letter is not any representation of any authority in the directors to overdraw the account, or that there will be funds forthcoming to answer the cheques, and it does not imply any undertaking on the part of any of the directors signing it that he will personally pay or be answerable for any cheques, though drawn in that particular manner, if they should not be paid by the company. Bankers, to whom, on such cheques, large sums were owing by a railway company, having obtained a transfer to two of their number of preference shares, on which nothing had been paid, as a collateral security for the advances made by them:

Held  
(1) as on the literal construction of the correspondence which resulted in the transfer, there was nothing to show that the shares were to be fully or at all paid up, there was no misrepresentation or liability on the part of the directors to pay what was due upon the shares; but  
(2) under the circumstances the bankers were entitled to be relieved from liability in respect of such shares, and to have their names cancelled in the register of the shareholders of the company.

If a man misrepresents a fact, to that fact he is bound, if any other person misled by such misrepresentation acts upon it, and thereby suffers damage.
