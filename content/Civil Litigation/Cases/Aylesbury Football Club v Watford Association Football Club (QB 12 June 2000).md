# Aylesbury Football Club v Watford Association Football Club (QB 12 June 2000)

A young footballer's contract with the club was not beneficial and could not be enforced because the player received no extra training or experience, the terms were onerous for him, they restricted his freedom to pursue a football career and the payment of wages depended on the will of his employer.
