# Houghton v Trafalgar Insurance [1954] 1 QB 247

A car carrying six passengers was involved in an accident.The car was designed to hold a maximum of five passengers. The defendant insurance company sought to rely on the clause within the insurance contract which excluded liability, 'for damage caused or arising whilst the car is conveying any load in excess of that for which it was constructed’. The question for the court was whether ‘load’ could refer to passengers. Lord Somervell concluded that it did not:

I think that it would need the plainest possible words if it were desired to exclude the insurance cover by reason of the fact that there was at the back one passenger more than the seating accommodation

The ambiguous clause was construed against the proferens.
