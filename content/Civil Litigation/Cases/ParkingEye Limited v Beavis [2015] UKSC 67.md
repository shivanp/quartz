# ParkingEye Limited v Beavis [2015] UKSC 67

The appeal for _ParkingEye_ was heard at the same time as the _Makdessi_ decision and illustrates the new test more clearly.

## Facts

ParkingEye managed a car park for the owners of a riverside retail park. ParkingEye displayed numerous signs at the entrance to the car park and at frequent intervals throughout it. The notices stated that a failure to comply with a two-hour time limit would result in a parking charge of £85. Mr Beavis parked his car at the car park; he exceeded the two-hour limit. ParkingEye demanded payment of the £85 charge. Beavis refused to pay on the basis that the £85 charge was unenforceable as a penalty.

## Held

The obligation to pay the sum of £85 was a secondary obligation — it was triggered by breach of the contract. This mean that the court had to consider whether the clause was penal. The court concluded that the £85 charge was not a penalty. The Lordships agreed that ParkingEye had a legitimate interest in charging motorists for any period they occupied the car park beyond the two hours. Although the amount of the charge exceeded any likely loss (the loss was whatever a motorist would need to pay to use the parking space for the extra time — much less than £85), Parking Eye had a responsibility to manage the car park effectively, and it was legitimate to use the charges as a means of influencing the conduct of motorists in order to ensure they did not overstay. In this context, the £85 charge was proportionate to that interest.
