# North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Hyundai Construction Co Ltd and Another (The Atlantic Baron) [1979] QB 705

Hyundai (shipbuilders) agreed to build a tanker for North Ocean (a shipping company), but refused to deliver the ship unless North Ocean agreed to pay 10% more than the contract price. The court readily concluded that this threat to breach a contract was illegitimate but ultimately North Ocean Shippingâ€™s claim failed because they failed to protest at the threatened breach (in addition, as explained further below, it was not until some eight months later that they claimed the return of the extra 10 per cent).
