# Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341

#key-case

FACTS: The claimant, who was a mill owner, contracted with the defendant carrier to take a broken mill-shaft to the makers as a pattern for a new one. Owing to the carrier's neglect, there was a delay in the transport of the broken mill-shaft, which resulted in considerable losses for the mill owner, because no spare shaft was available.

HELD: Applying the above two-stage test, the court held (considering the first limb) that in most cases of a breach of this kind, no such losses would have followed (as a spare shaft would be available), so it could not be said that the losses followed naturally from the breach.

Nor (considering the second limb) was the defendant aware, at the time of the contract, that the mill would not be able to function at all without this particular shaft, and so the loss could not 'reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties'. Therefore, the losses were not recoverable. The losses might have been recoverable under the second limb if the special circumstances (that delay would cause a loss of profit) had been communicated to the defendant at the time of contracting, but they had not been.

## Facts

The crankshaft broke in the Claimantâ€™s mill. He engaged the services of the Defendant to deliver the crankshaft to the place where it was to be repaired and to subsequently return it after it had been repaired. Due to neglect of the Defendant, the crankshaft was returned 7 days late. The Claimant was unable to use the mill during this time and claimed for loss of profit. The Defendant argued that he was unaware that the mill would have to be closed during the delay, and therefore the loss of profit was too remote.

## Held

The damages available for breach of contract include:

1. Those which may fairly and reasonably be considered arising naturally from the breach of contract or
2. Such damages as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both the parties at the time the contract was made.

If any special circumstances exist which were actually communicated to the Defendant, the Claimant may recover any damages which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under the special circumstances communicated.
