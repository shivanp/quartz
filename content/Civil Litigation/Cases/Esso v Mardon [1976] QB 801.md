# Esso v Mardon [1976] QB 801

Mardon took a lease of a petrol station after being assured by an Esso representative that the annual throughput would be 200,000 gallons (ca. 909 cubic metres) of petrol per year. This estimate was not accurate in the light of the planning permission situation at the time the contract was entered into. The estimated gallonage was never reached and, as a result, the petrol station was uneconomic. Mardon alleged misrepresentation. Esso argued that, as there had not previously been a petrol station on that site, the estimated throughput was merely a statement of opinion.

It was held by the Court of Appeal that the statement as to the maximum sales contained within it a statement that on a careful assessment, Esso had estimated the throughput at 200,000 gallons per year. In fact, the assessment had not been carried out carefully. Esso had substantial skill and expertise in estimating the potential sales of a petrol station in a specific location.

## Abstract

Where a special relationship exists, a negligent misstatement may be not only a breach of contractual warranty, but also an actionable tort as a breach of the duty of care which exists throughout pre-contractual negotiations and which survives the making of the ultimate contract. Esso granted a tenancy of a new filling station to D. During negotiations, they told him that they estimated an annual “throughput” of petrol at 200,000 gallons a year by the third year. Due to the physical characteristics and layout of the site, the figure after three years was still under 100,000. D lost all his money. He entered into a new tenancy with Esso at a reduced rent plus a surcharge on petrol sold. The losses continued and D was unable to pay cash for the petrol. Esso cut off his supplies, and eventually he had to surrender possession. He counterclaimed for breach of warranty, and for negligent misrepresentation.

Held,  
(1) the statement as to potential throughput was a contractual warranty, and the plaintiffs were liable for damages for its breach;  
(2) the statement was a negligent representation made by a party holding himself out as having special expertise in circumstances where a duty of care existed to take care that it was correct;  
(3) the measure of damage in both cases was the same, i.e., what D had lost by being induced to enter into the contract, which should be assessed on the same lines as damages for personal injuries to include estimated loss of earnings.
