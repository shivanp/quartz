# Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers' Federation (The Universe Sentinel) [1983] 1 AC 366

The claimant's ship was 'blacked' by ITWF, a trade union, meaning that ITWF withdrew the support of workers required in order for the ship to leave port. In order effectively to secure its release, the claimant paid, inter alia, the sum of $6,480 to ITWF's welfare fund. The House of Lords held that the agreement was brought about by economic duress. Lord Diplock found that the shipowners had no practical alternative but to agree (fulfilling 'lack of practical choice') and further the workers' threat to breach their contracts was exerted in bad faith as the workers had no legal basis to demand a payment into the union's welfare fund. The court allowed the agreement to be set aside, and the money returned.
