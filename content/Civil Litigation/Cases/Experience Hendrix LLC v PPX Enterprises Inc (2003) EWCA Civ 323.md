# Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc (2003) EWCA Civ 323

The dispute concerned improper granting of licences in relation to recordings made by the guitarist Jimi Hendrix. The court decided that it was not an 'exceptional' case within the meaning of Blake, and the court therefore refused to order an account of profits (i.e. a claim based on the restitution interest to take away the profit made by the party in breach). In particular, Mance LJ pointed out that:

> “We are not concerned with a subject anything like as special or sensitive as national security. The State's special interest in preventing a spy benefiting by breaches of his contractual duty of secrecy, and so removing at least part of the financial attraction of such breaches, has no parallel in this case.”

## Summary

Where there had been a deliberate breach of contractual obligations in circumstances where the injured party would have difficulty in establishing financial loss resulting therefrom, it was appropriate to take the exceptional course of assessing damages for breach of contract by reference to the profits made by the wrongdoer as a result of the breach.

## Abstract

E appealed against the refusal of the High Court ([2002] EWHC 1353, Daily Telegraph, July 18, 2002) to grant

(1) as to one part of the claim an account of profits or significant damages, and  
(2) as to the other part of the claim an order requiring the defendant, P, to account.

Prior to his death in 1970 H had made a number of records under contract with P. Following his death litigation between his executor, the predecessor to the present claimant E, and P was settled on terms. The effect of the settlement was that P was prohibited from exploiting some records but was entitled to exploit others for a limited period and thereafter only with consent. All records were exploited in breach of the settlement. E acknowledged that it would not have exploited the prohibited records itself, but claimed either an account of profits or more than nominal damages for the breach of settlement. In respect of the admitted breaches for the other group of records, which E would have exploited, E claimed an order for an account as distinct from P's original undertaking.

Held, allowing the appeal, that

(1) although the court could order an account of profits for breach of contract where the claimant could not prove that it had suffered any financial loss, this would only be done in exceptional circumstances such as national security, exceptional profits and fiduciary breaches, _[Attorney General v Blake [2001] 1 A.C. 268, [2000] 7 WLUK 824](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I69119B70E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a62bbca65116418e9449c01042f155f0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. Damages could be awarded for a breach of a restriction which had been imposed to protect the claimant's property where an injunction was refused because the court was only concerned with past profits, _[Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd [1974] 1 W.L.R. 798, [1973] 10 WLUK 84](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0A2CEF40E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=a62bbca65116418e9449c01042f155f0&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. Although this was not an exceptional case which justified an account of profits, P should make a reasonable and substantial payment for its unauthorised use of the master records, and

(2) the undertaking had not been sufficient given that the defendant was based abroad. Accordingly, an order, which might lead to an account by the court and which could be enforced abroad, was more appropriate.
