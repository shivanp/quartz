# Galoo Ltd v Bright Grahame Murray [1994] 1 WLR 1360

## Abstract

After Hillsdown Holdings (H) had acquired the entire share capital of Galoo (G) and the majority of the shares in its parent Gamine (GE), substantial inaccuracies were found in the accounts prepared by BGM. The plaintiffs appealed against a decision striking out claims against BGM for negligence and breach of duty. BGM cross-appealed that the remaining part of the claim by H should be struck out. A head of damage claimed by G and GE was that they incurred trading losses as a result of relying on negligent auditing when they would otherwise have ceased to trade. The question, whether in contract or in tort, was the nature of the causation required to establish liability for breach of duty. BGM submitted that the plaintiff's case depended upon the "but for" test which was not a proper test in English contract law.

Held, dismissing the appeals and cross-appeal, that, following _[Monarch Steamship Co Ltd v A/B Karlshamns Oljefabriker [1949] A.C. 196, [1948] 12 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IFC2C2560E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3439d5406287486baeb133dd73434825&contextData=(sc.Default))_, a breach of contract must be the effective or dominant cause of loss to sustain a damages claim. Following _[Quinn v Burch Bros (Builders) Ltd [1966] 2 Q.B. 370, [1966] 3 WLUK 25](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I2E513670E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3439d5406287486baeb133dd73434825&contextData=(sc.Default))_, it was necessary to distinguish between a breach of contract which caused loss and one which merely provided the opportunity to sustain loss. Following two Australian cases which represented the law of England, _Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp (1987) 9 N.S.W.L.R. 310_ and _[March v E&MH Stramare Pty 171 C.L.R. 506, [1991] 1 WLUK 219](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0A21E5C1E4B811DAB61499BEED25CD3B/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=3439d5406287486baeb133dd73434825&contextData=(sc.Default))_, whether a breach of duty arose in contract or an analogous situation in tort, it was for the court to exercise common sense in assessing whether such breach was the cause or merely the occasion of loss. Accordingly, the "but for" test was insufficient.
