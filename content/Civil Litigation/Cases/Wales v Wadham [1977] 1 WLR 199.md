# Wales v Wadham [1977] 1 WLR 199

A husband left his wife to live with another woman. Prior to and during divorce proceedings, the wife asserted that she would not remarry after divorce, as she had a conscientious objection to remarriage. The divorce settlement was negotiated on the more generous basis that she would remain single. Prior to the conclusion of the settlement, the wife agreed to marry another and did not communicate this change of intention to the husband. The husband sought to rescind the agreement on the ground of his wife's non-disclosure of her intention to remarry. The court upheld the settlement and dismissed the husband's claim. The wife had not misrepresented her then current intention when she told her husband that she would not remarry, and she was under no duty to disclose her change of intention.

## Abstract

Where a husband and wife reach agreement as to financial provision upon breakdown of their marriage, failure by the wife to disclose to the husband that contrary to former assertions she does intend to remarry may not vitiate the agreement, although the husband may have agreed to make the particular provision upon the basis that the wife would not remarry. The parties married in 1945 and had two children who, by the material time, were grown-up. In 1971 the husband left the wife to live with another woman; financial provision was discussed prior to and at the time of the husband's departure and the wife asserted, inter alia, that she would not remarry after divorce, due to a conscientious objection to remarriage. Although prior to filing a divorce petition in 1972 the wife told her husband that her views concerning remarriage were no longer so adamant, she did not inform him thereafter of the fact that she was considering marrying W after the divorce. In February 1973 the parties agreed that the husband would pay GBP 17,000 in final satisfaction of his wife's claim for financial provision, such agreement being embodied by consent in the order of decree nisi made in July 1973; no affidavits of means were filed, and the wife did not then disclose her plan to marry W. After decree absolute, the wife remarried. The husband thereupon sought to rescind the agreement on the ground, inter alia, of the wife's non-disclosure of her intention to remarry.

Held, dismissing the husband's claim, that the wife had not misrepresented her then current intention when she told her husband that she would not remarry; that on the facts the agreement was not a contract uberrimae fidei, and that non-disclosure of the wife's change of intention did not avoid the agreement.
