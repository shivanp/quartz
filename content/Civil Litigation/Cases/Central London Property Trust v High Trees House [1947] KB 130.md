# Central London Property Trust v High Trees House [1947] KB 130

#key-case

In 1937, the plaintiff landlord let a block of flats to the defendant tenant on a 99 year lease at a ground rent of £2,500 a year. When war commenced in 1939, only about one third of the flats had been let and the tenant was having difficulty paying the rent. Consequently, in 1940, the landlord agreed in writing to reduce the ground rent to £1,250.

The parties did not specify how long the reduced rent would operate for and there was no consideration for the reduction. By 1945, the flats were fully let. In September 1945, the landlord requested that the full ground rent be paid and he requested payment of the arrears for the last two quarters of 1945 ie the quarter ending 29 September 1945, and the quarter ending 25 December 1945. The tenant argued that the reduced rent was payable for the whole 99 year term or alternatively up until September 1945 on the grounds that the landlord was estopped from claiming the additional rent. Although, the landlord was not seeking to obtain the full rent from 1940, Denning J commented obiter, on his ability to do so.

The court held that where a promise was made which was intended to create legal relations and which, to the knowledge of the person making the promise, was going to be acted on by the person to whom it was made and which was in fact so acted on, then the promise would be binding.

Accordingly, the landlord could recover the rent for the last two quarters of 1945 and going forward. Denning J stated (obiter) that if the landlord had sought to recover the full rent from 1940 to 1945 period he would have been estopped from doing so.
