# Davis Contractors v Fareham Urban District Council [1956] AC 696

Facts: Davis Contractors agreed to build 78 houses within eight months for Fareham Council. The work took three times as long as it was supposed to, due to a lack of skilled labour, occasional stoppages due to a shortage of materials including bricks, timber and plumbers’ goods, and an exceptionally long frost followed by excessively muddy conditions. Davis Contractors incurred an additional cost of £17,600 in this time, on top of the £92,400 contract price, and they sought to claim this additional cost from Fareham. As the law stood at that time, if the contract had been frustrated, they would have been entitled to do so.

It was held that:

> “[W]here, without the default of either party, there has been an unexpected turn of events, which renders the contract more onerous than the parties had contemplated, that is [not] by itself a ground for relieving a party of the obligation he has undertaken”

Applying that to the facts of the case, the court held that the contract was not frustrated.
