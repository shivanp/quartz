# Co-operative Insurance Society Ltd v Argyll Stores (Holdings) Ltd [1998] AC 1

## Abstract

When A, the tenant of retail premises comprising the main unit in a shopping centre, closed its supermarket in breach of a "keep open" covenant in the lease because it was operating at a loss, C, the landlord, sought specific performance of the covenant and/or damages. The judge made an order for damages, but refused to order specific performance on the grounds that it would be inappropriate and against settled practice. His decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal and A appealed.

Held, allowing the appeal, that there was a settled practice that mandatory injunctions which required a defendant to carry on a business would not be granted, _[Braddon Towers Ltd v International Stores Ltd [1987] 1 E.G.L.R. 209, [1987] 1 WLUK 29](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I6AC63CE0E57211DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=7663623c90ed4a349d2c7958cde8256c&contextData=(sc.Default))_ considered. There were several sound objections to an order for specific performance, including the difficulties of enforcement and supervision by the court, the possibility of oppression caused by the threat of contempt proceedings and the potential for injustice where a defendant's loss in having to continue trading might be greater than the loss caused to a plaintiff through breach of the covenant. Whilst the decision on whether to grant specific performance was always one for the judge's discretion, the settled practice should be departed from only in exceptional cases. In the instant case, the obligation in the lease was not sufficiently precise to allow certainty as to what would constitute compliance, and specific performance should not be ordered.
