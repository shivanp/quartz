# Derry v Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 337

#key-case

A tramway company was empowered by a special Act of Parliament to operate certain tramways by using animal power. The Act further provided that, with the consent of the Board of Trade, mechanical power might be used. The directors of the company, wishing to raise more capital, included the following statement in a prospectus:

> “The company has the right to use steam or mechanical motive power instead of horses, and it is fully expected that by means of this a considerable saving will result….”

P, relying on this representation, bought shares. The company was later wound up because the Board of Trade refused to allow the use of mechanical power over the whole of the company's tramway. P contended that there was fraud.

The claimant failed to show that the defendant knew that the statement was false or an absence of belief in its truth, and therefore the false statement in the prospectus was not fraudulent.
