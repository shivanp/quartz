# Cundy v Lindsay (1878) 3 App Cas 459

A man called Blenkarn placed an order with Lindsay on credit (ie payment would be after delivery) for goods to be delivered to "Blenkarn, 37 Wood Street". There was a reputable firm of Blenkiron & Co. at 123 Wood Street. Blenkarn signed his signature in such a way as to make it appear that he was in fact ordering for Blenkiron, and Lindsay (who knew of Blenkiron but not their precise address) believed they were dealing with Blenkiron. Blenkarn took delivery of the goods and sold them on to Cundy. Blenkarn never paid Lindsay. Lindsay brought a claim against Cundy on the basis they never got good title to the goods.

It was held that the respondents at all times believed that they were dealing with Blenkiron & Co. of Wood Street and not the fraudster, Blenkarn. The contract was void for mistake as to identity.
