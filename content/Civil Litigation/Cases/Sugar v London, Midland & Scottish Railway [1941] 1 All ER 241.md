# Sugar v London, Midland & Scottish Railway [1941] 1 All ER 241

On 28 December 1939, plaintiff and her husband took tickets to Westcliff from defendant railway company, and, on arrival at Westcliff, plaintiff, preceding her husband along an ill-lit passage towards the exit of the station, fell into a hole made by workmen executing repairs, and thereby sustained injury. The tickets which had been purchased for this journey had the date stamped on them in such a way as to obliterate the words ‘For conditions see back’: Held by reason of the obliteration of the words on the ticket, ‘For conditions see back’, there was no proper notice of the conditions governing the carriage of passengers.
