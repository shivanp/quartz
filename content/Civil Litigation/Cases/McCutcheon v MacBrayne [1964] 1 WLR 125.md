# McCutcheon v MacBrayne [1964] 1 WLR 125

The claimant's car sank in a car ferry owned by the defendant. The claimant had used the car ferry on a few occasions previously. Sometimes he had been asked to sign a document containing an exclusion clause sometimes he had not been asked to sign a form. On this occasion he had not been asked to sign a document. The defendant sought to rely on the exclusion clause claiming it had been incorporated through previous dealings.  

  

Held:  

  

There was no consistency in the course of dealings and therefore the clause was not incorporated. The defendant was liable to pay damages.
