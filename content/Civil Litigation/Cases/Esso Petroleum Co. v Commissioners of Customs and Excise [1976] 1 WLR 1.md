# Esso Petroleum Co. v Commissioners of Customs and Excise [1976] 1 WLR 1

Esso ran a promotion whereby any person purchasing four gallons of petrol would get a free coin from their World Cup Coins Collection. The question for the court was whether these coins were 'produced in quantity for general resale' if so they would be subject to tax and Esso would be liable to pay Â£200,000. Esso argued that the coins were simply a free gift and the promotion was not intended to have legal effect and also that there was no resale.  

  

Held: 3:2 There was an intention to create legal relations. The coins were offered in a commercial context which raised a presumption that they did intend to be bound. However, the coins were not exchanged for a money consideration and therefore the coins were not for resale.
