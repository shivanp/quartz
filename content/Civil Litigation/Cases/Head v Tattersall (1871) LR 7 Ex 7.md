# Head v Tattersall (1871) LR 7 Ex 7

**Facts**: The plaintiff bought a horse from the defendant. The agreement was that the horse might be returned by a certain day if it appeared that it had not in fact hunted with the hounds.

**Issue**: Before the horse was returned, it was injured while in the plaintiffâ€™s possession but with no fault on his part. Did the claimant have a right to return?

**Held**: The claimant had a right to return the horse and recover back the price, notwithstanding that he was unable to return it in the same condition.
