# MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 553

#key-case

In this case a landlord agreed orally to reschedule rental payments under a licence agreement to give a tenant longer to pay, thereby varying the licence. The Court of Appeal considered whether there had been valid consideration for the variation. The court acknowledged that part payment of a sum already due is not normally good consideration. However, the judges agreed that there was sufficient consideration. Their justification was that the landlord obtained a practical benefit by keeping the tenant in the property (compared to leaving the property vacant). This benefit went beyond the advantage of receiving prompt payment of a part of the arrears and a promise that it would be paid the balance over the coming months.

The court also considered the fact that the landlord was not under economic duress from the tenant. It can be seen that in reaching this decision, the court applied the terminology of 'practical benefit' and absence of duress from Williams v Roffey. This decision appeared to blur the dividing line between a promise to accept less and a promise to pay more.

On appeal to the Supreme Court the appeal was allowed on the basis that the oral variation was invalid for reasons unconnected to consideration. Disappointingly, therefore, that made it unnecessary for the court to deal with the issue of consideration. The question of whether providing a practical benefit in the absence of duress is sufficient to make a promise to accept less binding went unanswered. Whilst Lord Sumption considered that Foakes v Beer was 'ripe for re-examination', he stated that if were to be overruled:

> "It should be before an enlarged panel of the court and in a case where the decision would be more than obiter dictum."
