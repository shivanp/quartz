# Re Selectmove [1995] 1 WLR 474

## Facts

Selectmove was a company which owed Inland Revenue tax. Inland Revenue petitioned to have Selectmove wound up over the debt. Selectmove resisted this. They argued that a representative of Inland Revenue had agreed to allow Selectmove pay the tax in arrears. Selectmove contended that this either gave rise to a contract or estoppel preventing Inland Revenue from immediately acting on the debt.

Inland Revenue argued that the representative had no authority to make any such promise. The representative had made this clear to Selectmove by telling them he would need to seek permission from his superiors. They also noted that in any case, Selectmove had also failed to pay the tax in arrears.

## Issue(s)

1. Was consideration provided for the representative’s agreement?
2. Did the representative’s agreement create an estoppel?
3. Did the representative have authority to bind Inland Revenue to a contract or estoppel of this nature?

## Decision

The Court of Appeal held in favour of Inland Revenue. This was primarily because the representative did not have (actual, ostensible or implied) authority to bind Inland revenue to any representation.

The court also noted that there was no consideration in this case. Selectmove was already under an existing obligation to pay the tax. A promise to fulfil an existing obligation at a later date could not amount to good consideration. It did not matter that Inland Revenue might secure more money by accepting tax in arrears than by putting the company into liquidation.

Finally, the court held that even if an estoppel had arisen, it was not unconscionable to allow Inland Revenue to renege on the promise. This was because Selectmove had failed to pay in arrears.
