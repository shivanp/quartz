# Sumpter v Hedges (1898) 1 QB 673

Sumpter had agreed to build two houses with stables on Hedgesâ€™ land, in return for 565l. After completing work worth around 333l, Sumpter told Hedges that he did not have enough money to finish the job, so Hedges did it for himself.

Sumpter only provided partial performance in this case.

Held: The court held that there had not been a voluntary acceptance of partial performance. For such acceptance to have occurred, the innocent party must have had the option to take or not to take the benefit of the work done.

Here, because the work had been done on the innocent party's land, the court felt that the innocent party had no choice but to complete the work. The builder was entitled to compensation for the value of the materials which he had left on site which had not been incorporated into the building which the innocent party used to complete the work. This was because the innocent party had the choice as to whether or not to use these, as they could have been returned.
