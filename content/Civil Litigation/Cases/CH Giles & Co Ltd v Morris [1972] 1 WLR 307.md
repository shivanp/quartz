# CH Giles & Co Ltd v Morris [1972] 1 WLR 307

Megarry J considered why a court should be reluctant to create an obligation to continue a business where a court might be asked to judge compliance:

> ‘difficulties of constant superintendence’ were a ‘narrow consideration’ because ‘there is normally no question of the court having to send its officers to supervise the performance of the order…. Performance … is normally secured by the realisation of the person enjoined that he is liable to be punished for contempt if evidence of his disobedience to the order is put before the court;….’
