# Alderslade v Hendon Laundry Limited [1945] KB 189

Mr Alderslade left ten large handkerchiefs with the defendant laundry to be washed. They were lost. The conditions on which the handkerchiefs had been accepted provided.

“The maximum amount allowed for lost or damaged articles is twenty times the charge made for laundering.”

Lord Greene MR held that:

>“There seems to me to be no case of lost goods in respect of which it would be necessary to limit liability, unless it be a case where the goods are lost by negligence […] If that be right, to construe this clause, so far as it relates to loss, in such a way as to exclude loss occasioned by lack of proper care, would be to leave the clause so far as loss is concerned — I say nothing about damage — without any content at all. The result is, in my opinion is [sic] that the clause must be construed as applying to the case of loss through negligence.”

As negligence was the only head of liability on the facts, the clause (in order to have some meaning) had to be construed to cover negligence. Note that negligence encompasses a breach of duty of care in tort and breach of a contractual duty to take reasonable care and skill implied by statute. As negligence was the only head of liability, the exemption clause **did** limit liability for negligence.
