# Darlington BC v Wiltshier Northern Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 68

## Abstract

In order lawfully to avoid the financial constraints of the Local Government Act 1972, G acted as financier to P council in connection with the construction of a recreational centre. G entered into building contracts with W, a construction company, for the benefit of P. Pursuant to a collateral agreement entered into with P, G assigned to P all rights and causes of action against W to which G was entitled under the contracts. In an action brought by P against W for breaches of the contracts, the judge held on a preliminary issue that P as assignee was not entitled to claim damages other than nominal damages. P appealed against the judge's decision.

Held, allowing the appeal, that  
(1) since both parties were aware that the building contracts were entered into for the benefit of P and it was foreseeable that damage caused by a breach of the contracts would cause loss to P, P, as assignee, could claim substantial damages for loss caused by W's breaches of the contracts, and the damages should be assessed on the normal basis as if P had been the employer under the contracts (_[Dunlop v Lambert 7 E.R. 824, [1839] 7 WLUK 81](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB9969690E57111DAB242AFEA6182DD7E/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4c6d5253ba204503b4c37d95587a2a9c&contextData=(sc.Default))_, Linden Gardens Trust v Lenesta Sludge Disposals [1994] A.C. 85 applied).
