# Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459

The plaintiff was induced to lend money to the company by a misrepresentation contained in the company prospectus. However, he was also induced by his own mistaken belief that he would have a charge on the assets of the company in relation to the loan. Nevertheless, he was able successfully to claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, even though he admitted that he would not have lent the money had he not held this mistaken belief.

A company issued a prospectus inviting the public to purchase debentures in the company. The prospectus said that the money would be used to improve the company's premises and expand its business. This was a statement of intention. The money was not used in this way. The investors alleged that the directors of the company knew that the money would not be used in this way, and therefore the directors had misrepresented their intention.
