# Foakes v Beer (1883-84) LR 9 App Cas 605

#key-case

**Summary**: Whether part payment of a debt is consideration.

## Facts

A debtor was struggling to pay his debt to the creditor. They reached an agreement whereby the debtor would immediately pay part of the debt, and the remainder in instalments. In return, the creditor would not bring any legal proceedings in relation to the debt. The debtor stuck to the agreement and eventually paid off the debt.

The creditor then claimed interest on the balance for the period in which the debtor had been paying the instalments. The debtor argued that the creditor was bound by her agreement not to bring any claims over the debt. The creditor argued that the debtor had not provided any consideration for this promise. Therefore, it was not binding.

## Issue(s)

1. Had the debtor provided consideration for the creditor’s promise?

## Decision

The House of Lords held in favour of the creditor. The debtor’s promise to pay a lesser amount, or the same amount over a greater period of time, was not good consideration.
