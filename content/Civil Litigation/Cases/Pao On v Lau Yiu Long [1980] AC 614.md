# Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614

**Summary**: When past consideration is good consideration.

## Facts

The plaintiffs (P) owned the shares of a private company which owned a building that the defendants (D) wanted to buy. The defendants were majority shareholders in a public company. P agreed to sell their shares in the private company to D so that D could acquire the building. In return P would get shares in the public company. Fearing a drop in share value of the public company would result, P and D made another agreement that P would not sell their shares for a while. However, P realized that D might profit from this agreement and demanded that this second agreement be replaced with one in which P was indemnified for any fall in share value but might also benefit from any rise in share value. Fearing that not agreeing to this would delay the main contract, D agreed. The share value did drop, and P sought to rely on the indemnity contract. D refused to comply with this, and the case reached the Privy Council.

## Issues

The defendants claimed that the consideration for the indemnity agreement was past consideration and had only been agreed to under duress.

## Decision/Outcome

The court found for the plaintiffs. Applying the exception to the doctrine of past consideration in [**_Lampleigh v Braithwaite_**](https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/lampleigh-v-braithwaite.php) **(1615) Hob 105** Lord Scarman said that an act done before a promise was made was good consideration for that promise if it was done at the promisorâ€™s request and the parties understood the act was to be paid for at a later date, and the payment or benefit would have been enforceable had it been promised in advance.

## Abstract

An agreement made in consideration of an act done before the making of the agreement may be enforceable where, inter alia, such act was done at the provisor's request.

Per curiam: Economic duress is capable of vitiating an agreement where it is such as to negative consent. The plaintiffs agreed to sell their shares in a private company to a company of which the defendants were majority shareholders in consideration of the issue to them of shares in the purchasing company. So as not to depress the market value of such shares the plaintiffs further agreed with the defendants that they would not sell 60 per cent of the newly issued shares until April 1974, the defendants agreeing, so that the plaintiffs might be protected against a fall in the value of the shares during such period, to purchase them at the end of that period at USD 2.50 each. Shortly afterwards the plaintiffs realised that the effect of such subsidiary agreement would be to deprive them of any increase in the value thereof.

They therefore refused to complete the main agreement unless the defendants in substitution for the subsidiary agreement agreed to indemnify them against any reduction in value of the shares below the price of USD 2.50 each during the deferment period. The defendants, fearing the consequences of delay in completion of the main agreement, so agreed, the agreement being expressed to be in consideration of the plaintiffs having agreed to sell their shares in the private company. The main agreement was performed, and thereafter the value of the shares fell below USD 2.50 each. The plaintiffs claimed an indemnity, which was refused by the defendants on the grounds, inter alia, that the consideration for the indemnity agreement was past consideration and/or that any such agreement was voidable by reason of the economic duress applied by the plaintiffs.

Held, that

(1) an antecedent act could be valid consideration where it was done at the promisor's request, where the parties understood that such act was to be remunerated by the conferment of a benefit and where such benefit would have been enforceable if promised in advance; and such criteria were here satisfied;  
(2) a promise to perform a contractual obligation for the benefit of a third party was good consideration; and  
(3) the commercial pressure to which the defendants had been subjected had not been such as to negative their consent to the indemnity agreement. (_[Casey's Patents, Re [1892] 1 Ch. 104, [1891] 11 WLUK 67](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I831463E0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c280ef3f0ce54a22b03f9f7a055c53f1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied and _[New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v AM Satterthwaite & Co Ltd (The Eurymedon) [1975] A.C. 154, [1974] 2 WLUK 102](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0C93D291E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=c280ef3f0ce54a22b03f9f7a055c53f1&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied).

That, although the defendants had been subjected to commercial pressure, the facts disclosed that they had not been coerced into the contract of guarantee and, therefore, the contract was not voidable on the ground of duress, that in the absence of duress, public policy did not require a contract negotiated at arm's length to be invalidated because a party had either threatened to repudiate an existing contractual obligation or had unfairly used his dominant bargaining position in negotiating the agreement and that therefore, the defendants, having failed to show that the contract of guarantee was either invalid or voidable, were bound by its terms (post, pp. 634B-E, 635B-D).
