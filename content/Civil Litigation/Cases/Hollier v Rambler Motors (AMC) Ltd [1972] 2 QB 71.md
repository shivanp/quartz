# Hollier v Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd [1972] 2 QB 71

The claimant had used the services of the defendant garage on 3-4 occasions over a five year period. Each time he had been asked to sign a document excluding liability for any damage. On this occasion the contract was made over the phone and no reference to the exclusion clause was made. The garage damaged the car during the repair work and sought to invoke the exclusion clause through previous dealings.  

  

Held:  

  

There was not a sufficient number of or regularity of transactions to amount to a previous course of dealings capable of incorporating the exclusion clause. It was not reasonable to expect the claimant to remember the clause from one transaction to the next. Consequently the garage was liable to pay for the damage.
