# Ecay v Godfrey (1947) 80 Lloyd's Rep 286

The seller of a boat stated that it was sound but advised the buyer to have it surveyed. This advice showed that the seller did not intend that his statement should be taken as a term of the contract and that the onus of verification of the soundness of the boat lay with the purchaser.
