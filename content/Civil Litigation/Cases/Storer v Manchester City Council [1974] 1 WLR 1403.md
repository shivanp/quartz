# Storer v Manchester City Council [1974] 1 WLR 1403

Included the words:

If you will sign the agreement and return it to me I **will** send you the agreement signed on behalf of the corporation in exchange

Lord Denning stated:

> “In contracts, you do not look into the actual intent in a man’s mind. You look at what he said and did. A contract is formed when there is, to all outward appearances, a contract. A man cannot get out of a contract by saying: ‘I did not intend to contract’ if by his words he has done so.”
