# Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] AC 488

In _Addis_, the House of Lords refused to uphold an award which had been made in relation to the 'harsh and humiliating' way in which the claimant had been dismissed from his job in breach of contract. _Johnson v Unisys Ltd_ [2003] 1 AC 518 confirmed that damages for distress and injury to feelings resulting from the manner of dismissal are unavailable in the law of contract.
