# Anglia Television Ltd v Reed [1972] 1 QB 60

#key-case

## Facts

The claimants engaged the defendant to star in a film which they were making. At the last moment, in breach of contract, the defendant refused to perform in the film, and the claimants had to abandon the film because they were unable to find a replacement actor. The claimants did not claim on the basis of the expectation measure (i.e., for the profit they would have made if the defendant had performed in the film) because they simply could not say what that would be — it was too speculative, too hard to predict. Instead, they claimed and obtained damages in respect of expenses of £2,750 in fees incurred for a director, a stage manager and others, which had been wasted by reason of the defendant's refusal to perform, even though these expenses had been incurred before the contract was made.

## Held

The claimants were entitled to these damages on the basis of the 'reliance measure'.

### Abstract

In a case of wrongful repudiation of a contract, the aggrieved party may claim by way of damages not only expenditure incurred after contract but also pre-contract expenditure within the reasonable contemplation of the parties. R, a well known actor, contracted to appear for A Television to play the lead in a play which they were producing. Shortly afterwards, R wrongfully repudiated the contract, and A Television were forced to abandon the production. A Television claimed their total wasted expenditure, but R contended that they were entitled only to their expenditure after the contract was concluded.

Held, the plaintiffs could claim expenditure incurred before the contract, provided it was reasonably in the contemplation of the parties as likely to be wasted if the contract were broken.
