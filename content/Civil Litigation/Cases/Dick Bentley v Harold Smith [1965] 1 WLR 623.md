# Dick Bentley v Harold Smith [1965] 1 WLR 623

Mr Smith, of the defendant company, told Mr Bentley that a car had done 20 thousand miles only since the fitting of a new engine and gearbox. The milometer also showed 20 thousand miles. Later that day, Mr Bentley took his wife to see the car and Mr Smith repeated his statement. Mr Bentley bought the car but it soon became clear that it had done more than 20 thousand miles since the change of engine and gearbox. The Court of Appeal held that the statement as to the mileage was a term of the contract. The defendant was a car dealer who should be taken to have better knowledge of such matters than Mr Bentley, who was not involved in the motor trade.
