# Kolmar Group AG v Traxpo Enterprises PVT Ltd [2010] EWHC 113

The defendants reneged on an original agreement to sell a quantity of methanol at a specified price for shipment within a set timeframe. Knowing that the claimants needed the methanol to satisfy an order for a very important client who had an urgent requirement for it, the defendants gave the claimants a “take it or leave it” proposal resulting in delivery of a lesser quantity of methanol at an increased price. The Court held that the claimants, in the circumstances, had no alternative but to accept the revised proposal. The defendants had made demands that they knew would cause the claimants loss that were backed by coercive and unlawful threats that they would not perform their obligations, and the claimants had complied with those demands as a result of those threats.
