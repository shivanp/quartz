# Facts

The defendants, the proprietors of a medical preparation called ‘The Carbolic Smoke Ball’, issued an advertisement in which they offered to pay £100 to any person who used one of their smoke balls in a specified manner for a specified period but who nevertheless still contracted influenza. The defendants also proclaimed that they had deposited £1,000 in a named bank ‘shewing our sincerity in the matter’. The plaintiff, on the faith of the advertisement, bought one of the balls and used it in the manner and for the period prescribed. Nevertheless, she contracted influenza.

# Held

The facts established a contract under which the defendants were bound to pay the plaintiff £100 in relation to the event which had happened, and so the plaintiff was entitled to recover that sum.
