# Combe v Combe [1951] 2 KB 215

Following a divorce Mrs. Combe's husband indicated that he was prepared to make an allowance of £100 a year to Mrs Combe. However, he did not make any of the agreed payments. In 1950, the wife brought an action, claiming arrears of payment under the husband's promise. The husband had made a promise which the wife had acted on.

However, the Court of Appeal held that since the wife had given no consideration for the husband's promise, she could not succeed in an action on it.

She could not use promissory to enforce her husband’s promise to pay. It is only possible to use promissory estoppel to stop the promisor going back on their promise that they would not enforce their strict legal rights. In the language of counsel for the husband in _Combe v Combe_, the doctrine of promissory estoppel is a shield and not a sword.
