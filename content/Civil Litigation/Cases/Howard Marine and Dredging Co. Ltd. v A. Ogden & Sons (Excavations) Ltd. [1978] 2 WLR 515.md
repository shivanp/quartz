# Howard Marine and Dredging Co. Ltd. v A. Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd. [1978] 2 WLR 515

Ogden hired two barges from Howards. Howards told Ogden that the barges’ capacity was 1600 tonnes when in fact it was 1055 tonnes. The figure had been derived from Lloyd’s Register which was wrong. The Court of Appeal held that it was a negligent misrepresentation under MA 67 s 2(1). The true figures were in the ships’ documents and Howards had failed to show any ‘objectively reasonable ground’ for disregarding the figure in the documents and relying instead on the Register.
