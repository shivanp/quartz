# MSC Mediterranean Shipping COmpany v Cottonex Anstalt [2016] EWCA Civ 789

## Summary

A carrier recovered demurrage in respect of the detention of shipping containers up to the date when the commercial purpose of the adventure was deemed to have become frustrated, by reason of the shipper's continuing breach of contract in failing to redeliver the containers within the free time allowed, which thereby became repudiatory. It also recovered damages in respect of the loss of the containers calculated by reference to their value at that date.

## Abstract

The appellant carrier appealed, and the respondent shipper cross-appealed, against a judgment that the carrier was entitled to recover container demurrage in relation to a shipment of raw cotton sold by the shipper to a consignee.

Between 7 April and 4 June 2011, the carrier contracted with the shipper to carry 35 containers of raw cotton by sea to the consignee in Bangladesh. Following a collapse in the price of raw cotton, a dispute arose between the shipper and the consignee with the result that neither of them was willing or able to take delivery of the goods, which remained at the port under the control of the customs authorities. On 27 September 2011, the shipper sent a message to the carrier that it had no right to deal with the goods as property in them had passed to the consignee. On 2 February 2012, as a way of breaking the deadlock, the carrier offered to sell the containers to the shipper. Those negotiations were unsuccessful. Clause 14.8 of the bills of lading provided for an allowance of a period of 14 days free time for the use of the containers, commencing on their date of discharge from the vessel, and for a daily tariff if the containers were not returned by the end of that period. The carrier sought to recover a sum in respect of demurrage incurred up to 30 April 2013, and demurrage for each day that the containers remained unavailable to it thereafter. The shipper alleged that its obligation to redeliver the containers was conditional on the nomination of a place for redelivery, that no place of redelivery had been nominated and no demurrage was therefore payable. The judge held that the carrier was entitled to recover demurrage for the period between the expiry of the 14 days' free time and 27 September 2011. His decision ultimately turned on his conclusion that the shipper had repudiated the contracts of carriage and the carrier had no legitimate interest in affirming them.

## Held

Appeals allowed in part.

(1) The relevant part of cl.14.8 provided that free time commenced on the day the containers were discharged from the vessel and imposed an obligation on the merchant to return them to a place nominated by the carrier before or at the end of the free time. It had to be understood in the broader context of the carriage of goods by sea. In that context, the concept of demurrage was well recognised as the payment of liquidated damages for the detention of the carrying vessel beyond the laydays at the port of loading or discharge. The nomination of a place for redelivery was not a condition precedent to the obligation to pay demurrage. The carrier could not be expected to nominate a place for redelivery before the containers had been discharged. Once the free time had expired demurrage began to run as liquidated damages for the detention of the containers. That detention continued, whether or not the carrier had nominated a place for redelivery, until the merchant was ready and willing to deliver the containers. If, at that stage, the carrier had failed to nominate a place for redelivery and had thereby prevented the merchant from redelivering the containers, a claim for demurrage would be met by a cross-claim for damages in an equivalent amount (see paras [14, 16-17](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

(2) It was hard to see how, in the absence of special circumstances, such a relatively short delay could have been sufficient to frustrate the commercial purpose of the adventure. By early February 2012, the delay had continued for another four months. The carrier's offer to sell the containers to the shipper in order to solve the problem was the clearest indication that the commercial purpose of the adventure had by then been frustrated. The shipper was in repudiation of the contract as from that date (paras [27-28](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(3) A repudiatory breach of contract did not automatically discharge the parties from further performance but gave the innocent party the right to choose whether to treat it as having that effect. It would have been wholly unreasonable for the carrier to insist on further performance. The option of affirming the contracts did not remain open to the carrier once the adventure had become frustrated, because at that point further performance became impossible. As at 2 February, the shipper could no longer redeliver the containers and, having brought about that situation by its breach, had become liable in damages for their loss. That loss was represented by their value on 2 February when the commercial purpose of the adventure became frustrated (paras [29, 42-44](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

(4) A clause in a voyage charter for the payment of demurrage at a daily rate should not be regarded as penal simply because it fixed no express limit on the period of the charterer's liability. In an appropriate case, general principles of law imposed a limit on the scope of the charterer's liability (para.[46](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
