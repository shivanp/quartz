# Jackson v Royal Bank of Scotland [2005] UKHL 3

## Summary

The fact that the principal buyer of a business's imported goods could have discovered the extent of the mark up on them prior to the parties' bank inadvertently informing the buyer in no way limited the extent of damages due. Furthermore, where no cut off point had been provided for in respect of damages in the contract between the business and the bank, the extent of damages resulting from a breach of the bank's duty of confidentiality was to be determined through the application of the test of remoteness in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 156 E.R. 145.

## Abstract

The appellants (J) appealed against the decision of the Court of Appeal ([2000] C.L.C. 1457, [C.L.Y.1507]) limiting an award of damages granted at first instance as against the respondent bank of both parties (R) for loss of the opportunity to earn profits from their trading relationship with a company (E).

J were partners in a business importing goods. They supplied E with dog chews manufactured in Thailand. The business between J and E was conducted by means of transferable letters of credit issued by R to E. E knew the identity of J's supplier in Thailand but was unaware of the mark up taken by J on each transaction. R, in error, sent E documents which indicated that J was making a 19 per cent mark up on each transaction. E terminated their relationship with J and J brought proceedings against R for the loss of the opportunity to earn further profits from their relationship with E.

At first instance damages were awarded to J on the basis that the trading relationship with E would have continued for four more years on a decreasing scale, after which J's chances of repeat business were so speculative as not to sound in damages. The Court of Appeal held that the award of damages should be limited to one year from the date of breach, all other loss being regarded as too remote. J argued that to limit the award to a period of one year was based on an error of principle and that R's liability was actually open ended as it had not limited its liability by the contract to any particular period. R, by its cross appeal, submitted that there was no foreseeable loss at all as it had not been within its reasonable contemplation that the disclosure of the profit that J were making would lead to the termination of the trading relationship.

Held, allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross appeal, that

(1) there was no evidence contemplated by the parties at the time of the contract that knowledge of the Thai supplier's identity and its contact details would lead inevitably to knowledge of the prices being charged by it. The fact that E had means of obtaining the information if it chose to was beside the point. The effect of the contract that R entered into was that it was obliged not to pass this information on, and J had an obvious and legitimate commercial interest in maintaining its confidentiality. There was no reason at all to suppose that, if they had been asked at the time of the contract, J would have agreed to the release of this information by R to E. The loss of repeat orders was not too remote. As soon as the confidential information was released there was no repeat business. J were entitled to an award of damages to put them in the same position as they would have been in if there had been no breach of contract.

(2) If no cut off point was provided by the contract, there was no arbitrary limit that could be set to the amount of damages once the test of remoteness had been satisfied, _[Hadley v Baxendale 156 E.R. 145, [1854] 2 WLUK 132](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IB88D33D1E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4713e447ece24f11917752b3babeb095&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. R had not included any provision in the letter of credit limiting its liability for loss of repeat business to any particular period. As the trial judge held, as time passed it was increasingly likely that E would have acquired the motive and means to squeeze J's profit margins and would ultimately have ended their business relationship. The award which the judge at first instance made was as good an estimate as any and was therefore restored in the interests of avoiding the further costs and delay involved in remitting the matter for further consideration.
