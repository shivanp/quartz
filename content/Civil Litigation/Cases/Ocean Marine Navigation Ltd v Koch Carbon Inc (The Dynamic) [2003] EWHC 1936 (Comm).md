## Abstract

O, owners of a vessel, appealed against an interim final arbitration award. O had chartered the vessel to K under a charterparty. The day before the vessel completed discharge, it was arrested by K to obtain security for various performance claims. The vessel remained under arrest for fifteen days. K was in repudiatory breach of the charterparty, having failed to effectively redeliver the vessel.

O claimed that the vessel remained on hire until it was released from arrest. O argued that it was not bound to accept K's repudiation of the charterparty and that the charterparty could be kept alive. O therefore challenged whether an award of damages was an appropriate remedy in the circumstances, arguing that the arbitrator had misapplied the law and that it was entitled to claim what was due under the charterparty.

Held, allowing the appeal, that the award would be remitted for further consideration. The general rule was that an innocent party had an option whether or not to accept a repudiation except where it could be shown that the innocent party had no legitimate interest in performing the contract.

The burden was on the contract breaker to show this. That burden was not discharged merely by showing that the benefit to the innocent party was small in comparison to the loss to the contract breaker. This exception to the general rule applied only in extreme cases where damages would be an adequate remedy and where an election to keep the contract alive would be unreasonable, _[White & Carter (Councils) Ltd v McGregor [1962] A.C. 413, [1961] 12 WLUK 27](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/IF912BAF0E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e5303662e98e4a6b87ec69ebe7bd4db3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ and _[Clea Shipping Corp v Bulk Oil International (The Alaskan Trader) (No.2) [1984] 1 All E.R. 129, [1983] 7 WLUK 316](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I8879EBC0E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=e5303662e98e4a6b87ec69ebe7bd4db3&contextData=(sc.Default))_ applied. The question in the instant case was whether the arbitrator had correctly applied those principles and there were no indications that he had.
