## Summary

Damages for breach of contract under the principles in Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd [1974] 1 W.L.R. 798, [1973] 10 WLUK 84 assessed on the basis of a hypothetical fee that would have been agreed for release of contractual obligations were not compensatory damages, and could not be justified simply because it was difficult to quantify financial loss, or because an award of such damages was considered to be a just response.

## Abstract

The appellants appealed against a decision that the respondent was entitled to claim damages for breach of contract assessed by reference to a hypothetical negotiation for releasing the appellants from their contractual obligations.

The respondent had bought from the appellants a business providing support for young people leaving care. They entered into an agreement containing non-compete and non-solicit covenants. The respondent brought proceedings alleging breach of that agreement. The judge held that the appellants had breached the covenants and the contractual and equitable duty of confidence, and that it would be difficult for the respondent to identify the financial loss it had suffered. He declared that the respondent was entitled to seek damages under the principles in _[Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd [1974] 1 W.L.R. 798, [1973] 10 WLUK 84](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I0A2CEF40E42911DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4f17744d18e148489bcf6540db844100&contextData=(sc.Default))_ for such amount as would notionally have been agreed between the parties, acting reasonably, as the price for releasing the appellants from their obligations, or alternatively ordinary compensatory damages. The appellants' appeal was refused.

## Held

Appeal allowed.

(Lord Sumption concurring in the result, but for differing reasons).

**Availability of negotiation damages for breach of contract – ** The court renounced the use of the term “Wrotham Park damages” and used the expression “negotiating damages”. The case of Wrotham Park was a source of potential confusion because of the opacity of its reasoning, and could now be regarded as being of little more than historical interest, Wrotham Park considered (see para.[3](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs") of judgment).

Common law damages for breach of contract were intended to compensate the claimant for loss or damage resulting from the non-performance of the obligation in question, and were normally based on the difference between the effect of performance and non-performance on the claimant's situation. Where the breach had caused the claimant to suffer economic loss, it should be measured or estimated as accurately and reliably as possible, but the law was tolerant of imprecision where the loss was incapable of precise measurement.

Negotiating damages could be awarded for breach of contract where the loss suffered was appropriately measured by reference to the economic value of the right that had been breached, considered as an asset; where the defendant had taken something for nothing, for which the claimant was entitled to require payment. Common law damages for breach of contract could not be awarded merely for the purpose of depriving the defendant of profits made as a result of the breach, other than in exceptional circumstances, _[Attorney General v Blake [2001] 1 A.C. 268, [2000] 7 WLUK 824](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/I69119B70E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=4f17744d18e148489bcf6540db844100&contextData=(sc.Default))_ followed. Common law damages for breach of contract were not a matter of discretion; they were claimed as of right and awarded or refused on the basis of legal principle (para.[95](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).

**Application to the facts –** Neither the judge nor the Court of Appeal had applied the correct approach. The judge had been mistaken in considering that the respondent had a right to elect how its damages should be assessed. He was also mistaken in supposing that the difficulty of quantifying its financial loss justified the abandonment of any attempt to quantify it, and awarding instead a remedy that could not be regarded as compensatory in any meaningful sense. The Court of Appeal had been mistaken in treating the deliberate nature of the breach, or the difficulty of establishing precisely the consequent financial loss, or the respondent's interest in preventing the appellants' profit-making activities, as justifying the award of a monetary remedy which was not compensatory. The idea that damages based on a hypothetical release fee were available whenever that was a just response, that being a matter to be decided by the judge on a broad-brush basis, was also mistaken.

The basis on which damages were awarded could not be a matter for the discretion of the primary judge. The effect of the breach in the instant case was to expose the respondent's business to competition that it would otherwise have avoided. The loss was difficult to quantify, and some elements of it might be inherently incapable of precise measurement, but it was a familiar type of loss for which damages were frequently awarded and could be quantified in a conventional manner. It was not a case where the breach resulted in the loss of a valuable asset created or protected by the right that was infringed. The hearing on quantum should proceed to assess the financial loss that the respondent actually sustained. If evidence was led in relation to a hypothetical release fee, it was for the judge to determine its relevance and weight, if any, but it was not itself the measure of the respondent's loss (paras [96-100](javascript:void(0); "View judgment paragraphs")).
