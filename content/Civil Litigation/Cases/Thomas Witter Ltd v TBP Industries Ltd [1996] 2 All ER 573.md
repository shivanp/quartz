# Thomas Witter Ltd v TBP Industries Ltd [1996] 2 All ER 573

## Abstract

In December 1989, D, a conglomerate negotiated the sale of a carpet company to P. In the course of so doing D negligently misrepresented that there was a special one off expense of GBP 120,000 in accounts produced, and that those accounts spread the bi-annual expense of producing pattern books over two years instead of immediately writing it off. The sale contract included a provision stating that P acknowledged it had not been induced to enter into the agreement by any representation or warranty, and a contractual limitation clause that D was not liable for a breach of the agreement unless written notice was given by January 1, 1992. When P sued for negligent misrepresentation, D sought to rely on those two contractual provisions.

Held, giving judgment for P, that

(1) the representation and warranty clause did not have the purported effect of excluding liability or remedies for misrepresentation as the [Misrepresentation Act 1967 s.1](https://uk.westlaw.com/Document/ICA01BA20E44811DA8D70A0E70A78ED65/View/FullText.html?originationContext=document&transitionType=DocumentItem&ppcid=464fe17136694ee59cd16cd3dc7be70a&contextData=(sc.Default)) rendered ineffective a clause intended to exclude liability for a misrepresentation which had become a warranty of the agreement, and even if that was not so, the clause would have been ineffective under s.3 of the 1967 Act as attempting to exclude all forms of misrepresentation including fraudulent misrepresentation and

(2) the limitation clause only applied to breaches of the agreement or claims on warranties in the contract, not misrepresentations inducing P to enter into the contract. Rescission was not available, as, on the facts, the parties could not be restored to their pre-contract positions. Significant changes had been made to the business following the sale and third party interests would be affected.
