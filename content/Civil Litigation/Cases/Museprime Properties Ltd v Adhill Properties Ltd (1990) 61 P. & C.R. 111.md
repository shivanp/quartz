# Museprime Properties Ltd v Adhill Properties Ltd (1990) 61 P. & C.R. 111

## Facts:

Adhill Properties Ltd, the defendants, were the landlords of the Â commercial premises located at N940, N 942, N944 on High Street, Finchley. Premises were subject to leases which included provisions for rent review after 5 years. According to the provisions, the landlord would send a notice about the review to the tenants, after that the tenants had one month to send a counter notice. However, if no counter notice was sent in time, the landlord would assume that the tenant has accepted the new rent. While the tenant of N940 objected the new rent by letter, tenants of N942 and N944 did make a phone call but did not send any written notices to the landlord.

Subsequently, defendants sold the premises to the plaintiffs, Museprime Properties Ltd. However, the sale particulars stated that the rents with the tenants were still negotiable since the landlords have rejected counter notices from the tenants. On the basis of this representation, the plaintiffs purchased the premises. Later, they discovered that in respects of N942 and N944, since there was no written counter notice served within one month, the agreement has been reached for the new rent with the defendants. However, the plaintiffs considered new rent too low. Consequently, they brought an action to rescind the contract on grounds of misrepresentation.

## Issues:

Did the phone call by the tenants of N942 and N944 amount to the counter notice?

Was the statements made by the defendants material enough to amount to misrepresentation?

## Held:

The court held that in relation to N942 and N944 the counter notices made over the phone call were not effective. Therefore, there was an effective agreement about the new rent. Consequently, the representations that defendants made were misrepresentations. Furthermore, since these misrepresentations induced the plaintiffs to enter into the contract, the courts were satisfied with the materiality of them. Museprime Properties Ltd v Adhill Properties Ltd, the plaintiff had the right to rescind their contract.
