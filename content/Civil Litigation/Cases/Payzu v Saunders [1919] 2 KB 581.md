# Payzu v Saunders [1919] 2 KB 581

FACTS: The defendant agreed to sell the claimants 200 pieces of silk. The goods were to be delivered as required and payment was to be made monthly following delivery. The first consignment was delivered and the claimants wrote a cheque for it, which the defendant did not receive, and so the claimants sent another cheque. This delay caused the defendant to form the mistaken impression that the claimants were in financial difficulties, leading the defendant to refuse to make any further deliveries. This amounted to a repudiatory breach by the defendant. However, the defendant then offered to continue to supply the claimants under a new contract at the same price on the same terms, except for the single change that payment was to be made in cash on delivery. The claimants refused to accept this offer and sought damages for breach of contract. The market price of silk had risen, and consequently damages of the difference between the market price and contract price were sought.

HELD: the claimants should have mitigated their loss by accepting the defendant's offer. Damages were confined to the loss that the claimants would have suffered if they had paid cash and acquired the goods at the contract price, i.e., the loss of a month's credit which had originally applied under the contract.
