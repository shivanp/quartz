# Clarke v Dickson (1858) EB & E 148

The representee was induced to take shares in a partnership which was later converted into a limited liability company and the company was in the process of being wound up.

HELD: Rescission was impossible since the existing shares were wholly different in nature and status from those originally received. As rescission is essentially an equitable remedy, the court will not allow minor imperfections in the restoration of the original position to stand in the way of a remedy.
