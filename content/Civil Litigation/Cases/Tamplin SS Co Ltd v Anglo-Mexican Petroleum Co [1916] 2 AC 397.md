# Tamplin SS Co Ltd v Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Co [1916] 2 AC 397

The court had to decide whether the requisitioning of a ship (for the purposes of war) in February 1915 frustrated a five year charterparty which was to last until December 1917. The court held that it did not, on the basis that the war would soon be over and thus a considerable proportion of the charterparty would remain. In the circumstances, this was overly optimistic, but it nevertheless demonstrates the problems facing a court in reaching satisfactory conclusions.
