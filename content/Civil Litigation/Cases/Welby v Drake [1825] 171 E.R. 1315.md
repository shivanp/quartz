# Welby v Drake [1825] 171 E.R. 1315

(If one is sued on a bill of exchange, and it appear that the plaintiff has agreed with a third person that if he will advance part of the sum for the defendant, the plaintiff will take that in discharge of the whole debt, and such third person so advances it, that is a good defence to the action.)

Assumpsit against the defendant as drawer of a bill for £18, 3s. 11d., which had been returned unaccepted.

It appeared that the plaintiff had agreed that if the defendant's father would pay him £9 he would accept it in satisfaction of the whole debt; and this sum of £9 was accordingly paid by the father. *1316

Chitty, for the defendant, contended, that though a party himself, by paying a less sum than is due, does not discharge the debt, yet if, in consideration of a third person coming forward to pay a less sum, the creditor agrees to take it in satisfaction, and that a less sum is so paid, it cancels the debt.

Abbott, C. J.—If the father did pay the smaller sum in satisfaction of this debt, it is a bar to the plaintiff's now recovering against the son; because by suing the son he commits a fraud on the father, whom he induced to advance his money on the faith of such advance being a discharge of his son from further liability.

Verdict for the defendant.
