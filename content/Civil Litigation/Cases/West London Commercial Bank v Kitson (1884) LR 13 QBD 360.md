# West London Commercial Bank v Kitson (1884) LR 13 QBD 360

Directors of a tramway company accepted, as such directors, a bill of exchange, payable to order, by and on behalf of the company. The special Act under which the company was incorporated gave them no power to accept bills:

Held an action was maintainable against the directors who signed the acceptance for damages for falsely representing that they were authorised by the company to accept bills, which was a false representation of fact and not of law.

> Where there is a representation made as to a mere matter of law it is, in nineteen cases out of twenty, made by a person who does not know the law better than the person to whom it is made, and at whose risk it is taken and acted upon. Still I am not prepared to say, and I doubt whether, if a man who wilfully misrepresented the law, would be allowed in equity to retain any benefit he got by such representation. … In the present case, it is not a representation of a matter of law. It is a representation as to the powers of a company to accept bills, and that depends on their private Acts of Parliament. Suppose I were to say I have a private Act of Parliament which gives me power to do so-and-so. Is not that an assertion that I have such an Act of Parliament? It appears to me to be as much a representation of a matter of fact as if I had said I have a particular bound copy of ‘Johnson’s Dictionary’ (Bowen LJ).
