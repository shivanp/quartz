# Avery v Bowden (1856) 5 E & B 714

By contract, the claimant was to carry cargo for the defendant. The claimant arrived early to collect the cargo and the defendant told them to sail on as they did not have any cargo for them to carry and would not have by the agreed date. The claimant decided to wait around in the hope that the defendant would be able to supply some cargo. However, before the date the cargo was supposed to be shipped the Crimean war broke out which meant the contract became frustrated. The claimant therefore lost their right to sue for breach. Had they brought their action immediately, they would have had a valid claim.
