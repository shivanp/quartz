# Keates v The Earl of Cadogan (1851) 10 CB 591

The defendant let a house to the plaintiff knowing that the plaintiff wanted it for immediate occupation but did not tell the plaintiff that the house was in fact uninhabitable. It was held that in the absence of fraud, the defendant was under no implied duty to disclose the state of the house.
