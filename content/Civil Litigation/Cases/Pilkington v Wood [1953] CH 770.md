# Pilkington v Wood [1953] CH 770

## Abstract

The so-called duty which rests on a person injured by a breach of contract to mitigate the damages does not go so far as to oblige the injured party, even under an indemnity, to embark on a complicated and difficult piece of litigation against a third party.

Thus, a person who has bought property as direct result of negligent advice tendered by his solicitor that a good title has been shown is under no obligation, on discovering a defect in the title, to sue the vendor under the covenant for title before proceeding against his solicitor for damages for negligence. By a conveyance dated April 27, 1950, the vendor, as beneficial owner, conveyed a house to the plaintiff in fee simple for GBP 6,000. The plaintiff employed the defendant as his solicitor in connection with the purchase and paid him his scale fee of GBP 63. The plaintiff went into occupation and spent GBP 400 to GBP 500 on improvements and repairs. In December, 1951, the plaintiff entered into a contract for the sale of the property.

On being supplied with an abstract of the plaintiff's title, the purchaser's solicitors pointed out a defect in it and declined to go on with the purchase. The defect was that it appeared on the face of the abstract of title that the vendor to the plaintiff had purchased the property from the trustees of his father's will, of whom he himself was one. The class of persons claiming under that will had not been closed and, therefore, for a number of years at any rate it would be impossible to say with certainty that no claim could arise to upset the transaction.

The plaintiff claimed damages, alleging that as a result of the defendant's negligence he had acquired a property with an unmarketable title. He also claimed as special damages the defendant's scale fee of GBP 63, the cost of improvements done by him and of the purchase of another house, his expenses in connection with his new employment, the cost of a valuation of the property, interest on an overdraft and costs thrown away. The defendant contended that, by virtue of the doctrine of mitigation of damages, it was the duty of the plaintiff before suing him in damages to seek to recover damages against his vendor under the covenant for title implied by reason of the conveyance as beneficial owner.

Held,

(1) it was no part of the plaintiff's duty to embark on the proposed litigation (even if an indemnity against his costs were offered) in order to protect his solicitor from the consequences of his own carelessness;

(2) although a policy of insurance designed to cover the consequences of the defect might mitigate the pecuniary damage, it would not mend the title or make the purchase more attractive to a person buying the property for a home;

(3) as far as the proper amount of damage was concerned, there had to be taken into account the fact that a sum of GBP 2,500 would have to be paid before the property were returned to the trust, the chance that no claim would ever be made and that the title would eventually ripen into security, and the chance of recovering something against the vendor on his covenant for title; therefore, a fair estimate of the diminution in value of the property from its market price at the date of the breach in 1950 of GBP 6,000 with a good title ought to be set as GBP 2,000;

(4) the defendant's scale fee could not be recovered in this action; the costs thrown away were a matter of agreement at the hearing; the remainder of the special damages claimed were too remote as they were not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties when the defendant assumed the duty of advising the plaintiff.
