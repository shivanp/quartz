# Woodar v Wimpey [1980] 1 WLR 277

## Summary

An unjustified purported rescission of a contract for the sale of land does not necessarily amount to repudiation.

## Abstract

Under a contract by which the appellants agreed to purchase land from the respondents, provision was made for the appellants' right to rescind the contract if prior to completion the process of compulsory purchase "shall have commenced." The fact prior to exchange of contracts the Minister had commenced compulsory purchase proceedings in respect of the land. Subsequently the appellants purported to rescind the contract on the grounds of the commencement of those proceedings. The respondents did not accept that rescission was justified but indicated that the courts could decide such issue. The respondents thereupon issued proceedings seeking a declaration that the appellants were not entitled to rescind and the appellants counterclaimed for a declaration to the opposite effect. In a second action, later consolidated with the first, the respondents contended that the appellants' action amounted to a repudiation of the contract which they, the respondents, now accepted and claimed damages accordingly. The trial judge held for the respondents that the rescission was unlawful and amounted to repudiation. On appeal the appellants conceded that they were not entitled to rescind (their right to do so arising only in respect of compulsory purchase proceedings begun after the date of contract) but denied repudiation. The judge's decision on liability was upheld.

Held, allowing the appellants' further appeal (Lord Salmon and Lord Russell of Killowen, dissenting), that in attempting to rescind the appellants were seeking to rely, albeit erroneously, upon the terms of the contract itself and there was no evidence that they intended to repudiate the contract or refuse future performance if the issue as to the right to rescind was decided against them; and (unanimously) that the nature of the appellants' defence and counterclaim was not of itself sufficient to amount to a repudiation.
