# Cavendish Square Holdings BV v Talal El Makdessi [2015] UKSC 67

## Facts

Mr Makdessi agreed to sell Cavendish a substantial stake in his advertising company in the Middle East, but the contract provided that Mr Makdessi would retain a 20% shareholding in the holding company after the acquisition. Cavendish had an option to purchase this retained shareholding subsequently as part of the deal. Part of the purchase price was to be paid by Cavendish in instalments after completion (known as deferred consideration).

Mr Makdessi had built a considerable amount of personal goodwill through the company over the years, which meant that the company would be worth less to Cavendish if he competed against it. Accordingly, the sale and purchase agreement contained a clause (a 'restrictive covenant'), which prevented him competing with the business following completion of the sale. If Makdessi breached the covenant, the sale and purchase agreement contained default clauses saying that:

1. Mr Makdessi would not be entitled to receive the final two instalments of the deferred consideration; and further
2. Cavendish could exercise the option of purchasing Mr Makdessi's retained shareholding, but at a much reduced price.

Mr Makdessi did compete against the company in breach of this clause. Accordingly, Cavendish tried to exercise the default clauses. The potential impact of this for Mr Makdessi was to deprive him of deferred consideration of $44m and to allow Cavendish to purchase his shares under the option for a price which was tens of millions of dollars lower than otherwise. In contrast, the damage he had actually caused to the company by competing was valued at just $500,000.

As a result of this disparity, Mr Makdessi asked the Court for a declaration that Cavendish's rights under the default clauses were unenforceable penalty clauses.

## Held

The Supreme Court determined that the default clauses were not penal.

It considered first whether the clauses in question were primary or second obligations. It held that, notwithstanding that they were triggered by 'breach', they were in effect a primary obligation — the withholding of the final payments was a 'price adjustment' mechanism adjusting the price payable to Mr Makdessi, and the transfer of shares was a way for the company and Mr Makdessi to part company in circumstances when Mr Makdessi started competing with it.

You can see how, once the court determined that the clause was part of a price adjustment mechanism, it was not appropriate to intervene – the court has no power to intervene in a contract just because it considers the price agreed is unfair.
