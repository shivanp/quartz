# Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams [1957] 1 WLR 370

The claimant car dealers, Oscar, agreed on a trade-in of Williams' old car as part of a new purchase. Williams had no knowledge of the motor trade. The registration book of the car traded in gave its date as 1948 and Williams confirmed this date in good faith. It was later discovered that the date should have been 1939 and the car was worth much less than thought. The Court of Appeal held that the age of the car was not a term of the contract and therefore there was no breach of contract by Williams. It was clear that the skill and expertise lay in the hands of Oscar, the car dealers, and not in the hands of Williams, who was making the statement. Consequently, the statement remained as a representation without contractual force.
