# Lewis V Averay [1972] 1 QB 198

#key-case

## Facts

The claimant put an advertisement in a newspaper, offering to sell his car for £450. In response to the advertisement, a man (who turned out to be a fraudster) telephoned and asked if he could see the car. That evening, when he came to see the car, he told the claimant that he was Richard Greene, making the claimant believe that he was the well-known film actor of that name. The fraudster wrote a cheque for the agreed sum of £450. At first, the claimant was not prepared to let him take the car until the cheque had cleared. When the fraudster pressed to be allowed to take the car with him, the claimant asked: 'Have you anything to prove that you are Mr Richard A. Greene?'. The fraudster produced a special pass for admission to Pinewood Studios, bearing his own photograph and the name of Richard A. Greene. The claimant was satisfied that the man really was Mr Richard Greene, the film actor. He let the fraudster take the car in return for the cheque.

A few days later, the claimant discovered that the cheque was worthless. In the meantime, the fraudster sold the car to the defendant, who paid £200 for it entirely in good faith. The fraudster then disappeared. The claimant brought an action against the defendant, claiming damages for conversion.

## Held

The Court of Appeal held that it is presumed that the seller intended to deal with the person in front of them identified by sight and hearing and that is what had happened. So the contract was not void for mistake, although it would be voidable for misrepresentation (the fraudster had misrepresented who he was).

This presumption will only be rebutted, and the contract held void for mistake, if the seller is able to establish that identity, rather than attributes, was of ‘vital importance’. Applying that test to the facts, the Court of Appeal held that what the seller really cared about in this case was Mr Green's creditworthiness — an attribute, rather than a matter of identity. Therefore, the contract was voidable for misrepresentation (the buyer had misrepresented his attributes) but not void for mistake.

Viewed in this way, it seems a very heavy burden to show an operative mistake in the case of a face to face contract.
