# Jarvis v Swan Tours [1973] QB 233

Damages may be recovered in a proper case for mental distress occasioned by breach of contract. J booked a fifteen-day winter sports holiday with ST on the faith of their brochure which described the holiday in very attractive terms. He paid their charges of GBP 63.45. The holiday was a great disappointment to him. For the first week it was to some extent inferior and for the second week much inferior to what he had been led to expect. The county court judge awarded him GBP 31.72 damages. On J's appeal against the amount awarded, held, allowing the appeal, that he was entitled to be compensated for his disappointment and distress and the damages should be increased to GBP 125.
