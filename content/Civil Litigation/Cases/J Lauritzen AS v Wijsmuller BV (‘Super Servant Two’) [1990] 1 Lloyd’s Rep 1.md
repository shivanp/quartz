# J Lauritzen AS v Wijsmuller BV (‘Super Servant Two’) [1990] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1

The defendants agreed to transport the claimant’s oil rig using one of their barges, either Super Servant One or Super Servant Two. The defendants elected to use Super Servant Two for this contract, and before the date of performance entered into other contracts to use the Super Servant One. Super Servant Two sank. The defendants could not use Super Servant One, as this was needed to perform the other contracts. The court held that it was the defendant’s choice to allocate Super Servant One to other contracts, making it impossible to perform their contract with the claimants. This choice meant the defence of frustration failed — it was self-induced.
