# Birse Construction Ltd v Eastern Telegraph Co Ltd [2004] EWHC 2512

BCL built a training college for ET. Issues arose as to the final account and defects which were compromised by the parties in an agreement of March 1995. BCL made good defects until it was instructed to stop in 1996.

Proceedings were subsequently brought concerning defects in the construction of the college, which ET alleged were the fault of BCL. BCL made a claim seeking to recover an unpaid retention and ET filed a defence relying on other defects. ET had put right some defects itself and decided to sell the college in 2000. The parties had compromised the proceedings prior to judgment being delivered.

An issue arose, having regard to previous authority, as to the appropriate measure of damages. ET argued that, applying the approach in Ruxley Electronics, the cost of reinstatement was the ordinary measure of damages for defective performance under a building contract, even where there was little or no difference in value. It submitted that loss was not any the less ‘real’ if the defect had been remedied and a cost incurred in so doing, nor was it a loss that somehow ceased to be ‘real’ if the defect was not remedied and no cost was incurred. The loss was, and was caused by, the defective performance provided and was not a function of or the consequence of the action or inaction of the innocent party.  

_Held_ – The essence of the approach in Ruxley Electronics to determining the appropriate measure of damages was the use of common sense. **A pragmatic approach might have to be applied, but a claimant was not to be too readily deprived of the ordinary measure of compensation.** If there were any items that truly affected the general appearance, comfort and amenity of the property then any reasonable owner with resources, such as ET, would have put them right promptly either at the same time as the main works or soon thereafter as part of a planned scheme.

On that basis alone, a claim for general damages based on the totality of the unremedied defects had to fail. Moreover, if the property was sold, ET’s supposed loss would have been avoided. If a building owner disposed of a property with defects attributable to some breach of duty by a contractor and for which the cost of reinstatement was the appropriate measure, but did so without any reduction or loss on account of its condition, then the loss that the law supposed was avoided and no damages were recoverable. However, **in some cases it might be reasonable (or even proportionate) to award an amount so that the contractor did not get paid for what was not done.** If it was not done at all then either an appropriate contractual reduction in the price or a comparable award of damages should be made.
