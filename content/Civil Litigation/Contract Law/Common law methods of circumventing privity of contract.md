# Common law methods of circumventing privity of contract

## Common Law Methods of Circumventing Privity of Contract

The rule that a third party should not be able to obtain a benefit from a contract to which they are not a party seems unfair at times, so there has been lots of judicial creativity in circumventing the doctrine.

Common law exceptions:

- Agency
- Assignment
- Actions in tort
- Other judicial attempts to avoid the doctrine

### Agency

An agency relationship occurs where one party, the agent, is authorised either expressly or by implication, by the principal, to contract on behalf of the principal.

Basic requirements necessary to establish an agency relationship:

- The principle should be named (usually by the agent) and it should be clear that the agent is contracting on the principal's behalf.
- The agent should be authorised to act as agent.
	- In the majority of cases, the agent's authority will be limited by the principal (e.g. authorised to sell certain of the principal's goods within a certain range of prices). The principal is only bound by acts of the agent which are within the agent's authority (or which appear to be in the agent's authority)
- Consideration has moved from the principal
	

Not a true exception to the doctrine of privity, since it is the principal who is a party to the contract with Party A. The agent is not a party to the contract and, once the contract has concluded, the agent's existence is no longer relevant.

### Collateral Contract

The court may find a collateral contract between the promisor and the third party to provide an exception to the doctrine of privity ([[Shanklin Pier v Detel Products Ltd [1951] 2 KB 854]]).

### Assignment

Where A is under a contractual obligation to B and B assigns their contractual rights to C, it may be possible for C to sue A on their promise to B. Because B is simply passing their rights to C, the extent of C's rights can never exceed the rights of B. Note that while B has assigned its rights, it cannot assign its obligations, so A still has rights against B.

If there is a prohibition against the assignment in the main contract (a 'non-assignment clause'), then any attempted assignment is likely to be unsuccessful ([[Linden Gardens Trust v Lenesta Sludge Disposals Ltd and others]] and [[St. Martins Property Corporation Ltd and another v Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons Ltd [1994] 1 AC 85]]).

A non-assignment clause could say something like:

> Neither party shall be entitled to assign this Agreement or subcontract any part of this Agreement to any person, persons, or company without the prior written consent of the other party.

Alternatively, parties may agree to limit assignment of the benefit of the contract or subcontracting the work.

### Actions in Tort

A person, C, who is not a party to the contract between A and B, may be owed a duty of care ([[Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562]]). This means conduct amounting to a breach of contract on the part of one of the contracting parties will constitute a breach of the duty of care owed to C. The third party (C) has the right to sue that contracting party for damages in tort.

In [[Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562]] the claimant was a third party in relation to:

- The contract of sale between the manufacturer of ginger beer and retailer, and
- The contract of sale between the retailer and puchaser of the bottle of ginger beer

This held that the privity principle from breach of contract did not restrict the range of claims in tort.

### Other Judicial Attempts to Avoid the Doctrine

The doctrine of privity was criticised in [[Woodar v Wimpey [1980] 1 WLR 277]].

In this class of cases, A contracts with B to provide something of benefit to C. If B fails to do so, C has suffered a loss, but cannot bring a claim because it is not party to the contract.

Albazero principle:

> Where a contract was entered into, and both parties knew that the end benefit of the contract was going to reside in a third party, then either party breaching the contract could be sued by the other party on behalf of the contemplated third party.

[[Darlington BC v Wiltshier Northern Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 68]] applied the Albazero principle from [[St. Martins Property Corporation Ltd and another v Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons Ltd [1994] 1 AC 85]] and extended it to cases in which the employer had never had a proprietary interest in the property affected.

This judicial boldness has been stemmed by a House of Lords decision in [[McAlpine v Panatown [2001] 1 AC 518]] where the court prevented a claim on behalf of a third party where they had their own right of action by an alternative route.

See also the recent case [[First Abu Dhabi Bank v BP Oil [2018] EWCA Civ 14]], where Linden Gardens was reluctantly followed by the Court of Appeal.

The Albazero principle will only be applied if the third party has no other means of recourse, consistent with the judicial intention to obviate the harshness of the doctrine of privity.
