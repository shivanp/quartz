# Existing obligation

In certain circumstances, an existing obligation will count as good [[Consideration]].

Executive consideration amounts to a party taking on an obligation. Before entering the contract, the party might already be under an obligation to do the same thing, due to

- An existing contract between the same parties
- Existing contract with a third party.

## Existing Obligations Between Parties

If a party is already contractually bound to Party A, to do something, then agreeing with Party A again to do that thing is generally not good consideration for a new contract ([[Stilk v Myrick (1809) 2 Camp 317]]). Conversely, if existing obligations are exceeded, there will be consideration ([[Hartley v Ponsonby [1857] 7 EB 872]])

### Factual Consideration

In [[Williams v Roffey Bros & Nichol (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1]], the claimant needed to show that they had provided consideration in return, which was difficult since this was obligated under the original contract to the same deadline. The court found consideration in the form of the 'practical benefit' received. The court called this *factual consideration*, as opposed to *legal consideration*. This acknowledges that nothing new is being promised but the party in receipt of promise is getting something out of the reshaped deal.

Conditions required to establish factual consideration (set out by Lord Justice Glidewell):

1. if A has entered into a contract with B to do work for, or to supply goods or services to, B in return for payment by B
2. At some stage before A has completely performed his obligations under the contract B has reason to doubt whether A will, or will be able to, complete his side of the bargain
3. B then promises A an additional payment in return for A's promise to perform contractual engagements on time
4. As a result, **B obtains in practice a benefit, or obviates a disbenefit**
5. B's promise is **not given as result of economic duress or fraud** on the part of A

Benefit to B is capable of being consideration for B's promise, so the promise is legally binding.

## Existing Obligations to a Third Party

Is it possible to have given consideration by doing something one was already bound to do under a pre-existing contract with a third party? Yes.

In the case of [[New Zealand Shipping v Satterthwaite [1975] AC 154]], Lord Wilberforce stated:

> "An agreement to do an act which the promisor is under an existing obligation to a third party to do, may quite well amount to valid consideration and does so in the present case: the promisee obtains the benefit of a direct obligation which he can enforce."

So a party offering this consideration is offering to put itself at risk of double liability – actions from two parties if it fails to meet its obligations.

## Part Payment of a Debt

Where a debtor promises to pay part of their debt in return for a release from the remainder of their liability, they are offering to do something which they are already obligated to do – seeking to offer an existing obligation as consideration. Not good consideration: the debtor remains liable even when the creditor agrees.

Key case: [[Foakes v Beer (1883-84) LR 9 App Cas 605]]. This rule is applicable only if the promise of the creditor to accept a lesser sum is unsupported by fresh consideration from the promisee.

### New Element into Payment

But if some new element is introduced, e.g.

- payment at a different place
- at a different time
- providing something else in lieu of money ([[Pinnel’s Case (1602) 5 Co Rep 117]])  
then the court will not enquire as to the value of the new element.

[[Sibree v Tripp]] establishes the point that if at the creditor’s request the debtor provides another item instead of money, then part payment of a debt will be good consideration.

### Payment of Lesser Sum by Third Party

If the third party enters into an agreement with the creditor, by which the creditor accepts payment by the third party of a lesser sum than the debt in full satisfaction of the debtor's obligation, the creditor cannot sue the debtor for the difference ([[Welby v Drake [1825] 171 E.R. 1315]]]).

## Foakes and Williams Conflict

In [[Williams v Roffey Bros & Nichol (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1]], consideration for promise to pay found in the practical benefit obtained from the other contracting party completing its contracting obligations. But in [[Foakes v Beer (1883-84) LR 9 App Cas 605]] didn't Mrs Beer obtain practical benefit from the instalment arrangement, given that if she tried to force payment of full sum, he could have been bankrupted, and she could have received nothing?

Any factual benefit obtained by the promisor was ignored, and it was held that no consideration was provided, because as a matter of law, the promisor had not benefitted.

To answer this: [[MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd [2016] EWCA Civ 553]]. Here, the landlord was held to have a practical benefit from property being occupied rather than vacant.

See [[Re Selectmove [1995] 1 WLR 474]]- probably doesn't apply to paying less, but can't be sure because it hasn't come before the courts yet.

See also [[Promissory estoppel]].

## More Analysis

Prior to [[Williams v Roffey Bros & Nichol (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1]], the law was clear: performance of (or a promise to perform) a duty imposed by law was not good consideration for a promise given in return. The rule was generally supported on the ground that it prevented public officials extorting money in return for the performance of their existing legal duties. Alternatively, public officials such as the police owe a duty to the public without the need for payment. Lord Denning obviously disagreed:

> A promise to perform an existing duty is, I think, sufficient consideration to support a promise, so long as there is nothing in the transaction which is contrary to the public interest.

### Stilk V Myrick

It is actually controversial whether, as a matter of fact, the master of the ship was benefitted by Stilk's promise to work the ship back home: it is likely that the master did benefit. The defendants of the orthodox interpretation of consideration argue by asserting that it is legal benefit or detriment which is important, rather than factual benefit or detriment.

### Williams V Roffey

The defendant contractors subcontracted the carpentry work to the claimant for £20,000. The claimant ran into financial difficulties after completing part of the work. This was partly attributable to the claimant under-pricing the job, and partly because of his own inability to supervise his workforce. It was in the interest of the defendants to ensure that the claimant completed the work on time because if the defendants were late in completing the work, they would incur liability to their employers under the terms of a penalty clause in the main contract. At a meeting, it was agreed that the defendants would pay the claimant £575/flat extra on completion to ensure the work was completed on time. The claimant was able to bring damages (though not full expectation damages).

A **pragmatic** approach was adopted: the defendants had obtained a practical benefit as a result of the claimant's promise to complete the work on time. This was sufficient to constitute consideration. The emphasis on 'practical benefit' is important. The case does not formally challenge the rule that a promise to perform an existing duty owed to the promisor does not constitute consideration.

But in reality, it has meant that courts today do not require much persuasion in order to find the existence of consideration. e.g., in [[Attrill v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd [2011] EWCA Civ 229]] the courts held that an employee who continued to work after his employer had promised to establish a guaranteed minimum bonus pool had arguably provided consideration for the promise to set up the fund. Could be argued that the consideration was provided by the employee *remaining* in employment and not exercising his right to terminate his contract, at a time when his employer particularly needed his services.

#### What Exactly Was the Practical Benefit Received?

Multiple practical benefits received:

- The claimant continued with the work and did not breach his subcontract
- The defendants were spared the 'trouble and expense of engaging other people to complete the carpentry work'
- The defendants avoided incurring a penalty under the main contract for delay in completion of the work
- A 'rather haphazard method of payment' was replaced by a more formalised scheme involving the payment of a specific sum upon the completion of each flat.
- By directing the claimant to complete one flat at a time, the defendants 'were able to direct their other trades to do work in the completed flats which otherwise would have been held up until the claimant had completed his work'.

First three factors above are controversial.

Wider discussion: policy grounds. *Williams v Roffey* has been applauded as a pragmatic decision. But modification of contracts are not necessarily in the public interest; there is a competing interest in holding parties to their original bargain.

#### How Can This Be Reconciled with *Stilk V Myrick*?

Judgment in *Williams v Roffey* was adamant that *Stilk v Myrick* had not been overruled, rather it had been refined and limited. But the two cases are very similar. The Court of Appeal attempted to resolve this by explaining *Stilk* as a duress case.

Hobhouse J in *The Alev*:

> Now that there is a properly developed doctrine of the avoidance of contracts on the grounds of economic duress, there is no warrant for the Court to fail to recognise the existence of some consideration even though it may be insignificant and even though there may have been no mutual bargain in any realistic use of that phrase.

This advocates a more liberal approach to consideration, maintaining that courts should be readier to find consideration since they know they can always set aside a contract for duress. Some commentators have gone further, saying that there are good reasons why the doctrine of duress ought to displace the doctrine of consideration in extortion situations, provided it can be rationalised. It has been advocated that the law of economic duress provides a more refined control mechanism than the law of consideration, rendering the contract voidable rather than void.

But is this conflating issues? Duress cannot displace consideration because the two doctrines perform different functions:

- Consideration is relevant to the question of whether or not a contract has been concluded
- Duress is a vitiating factor: a ground upon which an otherwise valid and subsisting contract can be set aside.

#### Other Theories

Existence of two contracts. Can a party wishing to avoid the application of the rule in *Stilk v Myrick* make clear to the contracting party that what is taking place is not a variation of the original contract, but a rescission of that contract followed immediately by the creation of a new contract in similar but not identical terms.

Collateral unilateral contract on top of the existing contract, to pay more or less if actual performance is rendered. So here consideration is provided not by the promise to perform an existing duty, but by the actual performance of that duty. It hinges on there being a difference in between the receipt of performance and the right of contractual performance, with the former being more beneficial than the latter. It may explain why claimants in W v R were only paid for the work done, and not the work promised but remained undone.

W v R moves English law in the direction of the conclusion that consideration should only be a requirement for the formation of a contract, and that it should not be required for the modification of a contract. Note that this distinction has been recognised in America.

### Part Payment of Debt

The majority of their Lordships decided in [[Foakes v Beer (1883-84) LR 9 App Cas 605]] that the practical benefit of part payment of a debt did not constitute good consideration in law.

MWB v Rock: Court of Appeal distinguished F v B and held that the landlord had obtained a practical benefit which went beyond the advantage of receiving prompt payment of part of the arrears and a promise it would pay the balance over the forthcoming months. Principal practical benefit: continued occupation of the premises by the licensee so that the licensor was not left with an immediate loss of income and the problem of finding another licensee to occupy the same premises. BUT this was overturned by the Supreme Court.

So Foakes v Beer stands for the proposition that the practical benefit obtained as a result of the promise to pay part of the debt does not suffice to constitute consideration. But the practical benefit obtained as a result of the preservation of the underlying relationship out of which the obligation to pay the debt has arisen would appeal to be capable of constituting sufficient consideration.

The Supreme Court in [[Rock Advertising Ltd v MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd [2018] UKSC 24]] had the opportunity to rule as to whether the receipt of a practical benefit alongside an agreement to pay less could amount to good consideration, but declined to do so. Foakes was stated to be 'probably ripe for re-examination', but no definitive answer as of yet, this would have to be done by a full panel of the court, when the opportunity arose.

So the inconsistency remains. A choice should be made between the two approaches: ought to have an emphasis on practical benefit in some cases, but an emphasis on legal benefit in other cases, with no rational explanation for the continued existence of such an inconsistent rule. Both [[Williams v Roffey Bros & Nichol (Contractors) Ltd [1991] 1 QB 1]] and [[Foakes v Beer (1883-84) LR 9 App Cas 605]] remain good law within their respective spheres of operation.

### Reliance on Non-bargain Promises

Can a claimant who relied to his detriment upon a promise of the defendant which was not supported by consideration enforce that promise? Depends on if you think consideration is built upon reciprocity, or as a reason for the enforcement of a promise. The liberal approach to consideration in W v R becomes important because it minimises the need for claimants to have to resort to estoppel and hence diminishes the practical significance of the limitations from which estoppel presently suffers (such as not being able to act as a sword).

Note the difference with American way of restricting the doctrine of consideration and so estoppel is way more important.

[[Combe v Combe [1951] 2 KB 215]]: the court held that there was no request from the husband, express or implied, for the wife to refrain from applying to the court for maintenance.

Note, there are many different types of estoppel. Denning LJ in Combe:

> The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a sidewind.

So estoppel must be reconciled with consideration. This is uneasy, and summed up by the maxim that estoppel can be used as a 'shield but not as a sword'. Note that this is really more of a spectrum. It is commonly stated that the estoppel must relate to the existing legal rights of the promisor: there must be a pre-existing legal relationship between the parties under which the promisor promises to give up some rights under that relationship.

Could promissory estoppel potentially have been raised in Stilk v Myrick? Ultimately issue hinges on whether the modification of contracts should be treated differently from the formation of contracts.
