# Privity of Contract

## Doctrine

Doctrine of privity of contract:

> A person who is not a party to a contract cannot acquire any rights under that contract or be subject to any of its obligations.

It is a fundamental principle of common law that no person can sue or be sued on a contract unless they are a party to it ([[Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge Ltd [1915] AC 847]]).

Recall that when considering contract formation, there was a rule that there must be consideration, and that consideration must move from the promisee. Rules on consideration and privity are distinct legal principles.

Combined effect: no person can sue on a contract unless

1. They are party to the contract, and
2. They have provided consideration.

In [[Tweddle v Atkinson (1861) 1 B&S 393]] the claimant could not enforce his father-in-law's promise, because consideration was not provided. But the claim could also have failed on the grounds that the groom was not party to the contract.

Uncontroversial: a third party should not be subjected to a burden by a contract to which they are not a party. Controversial: a third party should not be able to obtain a benefit from a contract to which they are not a party. The [Contract (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/31/contents) allows a third party, who is neither a party to the contract, nor has provided consideration, to enforce a term of the contract in certain circumstances.

The doctrine of privity can be circumvented with:

- [[Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999]]
