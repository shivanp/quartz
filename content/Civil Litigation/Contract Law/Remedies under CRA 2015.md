# Remedies under CRA 2015

[[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] regulates:

- Terms which it implies into certain contracts
- Unfair terms

[[CRA 2015 Part 1]] deals with consumer contracts for goods, digital content and services, while also providing certain remedies to consumers when those implied terms are breached.

## Contracts for Goods

Where goods sold to a consumer fail to meet any of the requirements of s 9 (satisfactory quality), s 10 (reasonably fit for purpose) or s 11 (correspondence with description), then goods are regarded as non-conforming.

3 remedial options for non-conforming goods:

1. Short term right to reject
	- Available for 30 days from time of ownership passing, goods being delivered, and trader has notified consumer that any required installation steps have been taken, where applicable (s 22).
2. Right to repair or replacement
	- Available unless repair or replacement is impossible/ disproportionate (i.e., unreasonably expensive for the trader, relative to other remedial options and interests of consumer).
3. Right to a price reduction or final right to reject
	- Or here is xor
	- Remedy may only be exercised where:
		- After one repair or one replacement, the goods do not conform to the contract, or
		- The consumer can require neither repair nor replacement of the goods (because impossible/ disproportionate), or
		- The consumer has required the trader to repair/ replace the goods, but the trader is in breach of the requirement to do so within reasonable time and without significant inconvenience to the consumer (s 24)
		- s 24(10): where the final right to reject is exercised within 6 months (clock running as above), there should be a full refund with no deduction for use. Does not apply to motor vehicles and some other stuff

See [[CRA 2015 Part 1]].
