# Remedies advanced

## Reliance Interest

Damages are normally claimed based on the 'expectation interest'. An alternative basis for the assessment of damages is the reliance measure. Allows the claimant to recover the expenses which have been incurred in preparing for, or in part performance of, the contract which have been rendered pointless by the breach.

[[C & P Haulage v Middleton [1983] 1 WLR 1461]]: claimant seeking a reliance loss failed because he failed to show that had the contract gone ahead properly, he would have been able to recoup this expenditure in any event (i.e., he made a bad bargain).

The claimant was limited to recovering a nominal amount of damages, in recognition of the technical breach sustained.

So ratio: it will only be possible for the claimant to claim his reliance interest if the contract had enabled him to recoup those expenses had it been properly performed.

It is for the defendant to prove that the claimant would not have recouped losses had the contract gone ahead ([[Omak Maritime Ltd v Mamola Challenger Shipping Co Ltd [2010] EWHC 2026]]).

This is an example of the key contract law principle that no award of damages can put the claimant in a better position than they would have been in had the contract been performed.

## Restitution Interest

In addition to expectation and reliance interests, this is a third possibility.

Represents the interest a claimant has in the restoration to him of benefits which the defaulting party has acquired at his expense.

(account of profits)

The gain to a defendant from a breach of contract is irrelevant to the quantification of damages, in general.

But after the decision in [[Attorney-General v Blake [2001] 1 AC 268]], now held that there are at least certain circumstances in which a claimant can recover the profit which the defendant has made from his breach of contract.

 'Efficient breach' would not alone justify allowing an account of profits. An 'efficient breach' is one where:

a) the breach was cynical and deliberate;  
b) the breach enabled the defendant to enter into a more profitable contract elsewhere; and  
c) by entering into a new and more profitable contract, the defendant put it out of his power to perform the contract with the claimant.

This is called an efficient breach because, on traditional measures of breach, it puts the breaching party in a better position than if there had been no breach. As stated above, this alone will not justify the award of damages on a restitutionary measure.

Circumstances in which courts will find situations sufficiently 'exceptional' to justify using the Blake approach:

- [[Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc (2003) EWCA Civ 323]]: not exceptional enough
- [[Morris-Garner v One Step (Support) Ltd [2018] UKSC 20]]: exceptional nature again emphasised.

Common law damages for breach of contract cannot be awarded merely for the purpose of depriving the defendant of profits made as a result of the breach, other than in exceptional circumstances.

### Debate

The restitutionary measure is controversial for applying in cases where the innocent party has no financial losses, when considering either the reliance or expectation interest.

To resolve this, some argue that the relevant loss arises when the contract-breaker proceeds with the breach without giving the other party the opportunity to licence the breach. The order for an account of profits is therefore a way of compensating for the innocent party's loss of bargaining opportunity.

But in Blake, this theory runs into problems: the Crown would never have agreed to license Blake's breach. The terms of the contract tying Blake to the Official Secrets Act were non-negotiable.

But Blake is exceptional: compensation in Blake is not for loss of bargaining opportunity, but for an egregious breach of terms that were known to be fundamental and non-negotiable.

Explore further these tensions in the following three papers by Craig Rotherham: ''Wrotham Park Damages' and Accounts of Profits: Compensation or Restitution?' [2008] LMCLQ 25; 'Gain-Based Relief in Tort After Attorney General v Blake' (2010) 126 LQR 102; and 'Deterrence as a Justification for Awarding Accounts of Profits' (2012) 32 OJLS 1.
