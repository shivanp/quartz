# quantum meruit

Literally, *as much as is deserved*.

This is a remedy whereby the claimant may be able to claim a reasonable sum so that the defendant is not unjustly enriched. The court will assess the value of a quantum meruit award on an objective basis using the information available to it, for example the usual market price for goods or services.
