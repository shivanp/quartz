# Executed consideration

> Where at the time of the formation of the contract, the consideration has already been performed.

e.g. unilateral contract where promise of reward is made, in exchange for the performance of some act ([[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1893) 1 QB 256]]). Required act is both the acceptance of the offer and the executed consideration.
