# Misrepresentation remedies

The [[Civil Litigation/Contract Law/Remedies]] available for misrepresentation are those of rescission, damages, and indemnity. The exact combination depends on the nature of the misrepresentation. The representee may also refuse further performance of the contract, pleading the representor's misrepresentation as a defence in the event of being sued for breach of contract.

## Rescission

Misrepresentation renders the contract voidable. So the contract is still valid and subsisting until the representee decides to rescind it. Available for any type of representation.

General rule: in order to rescind, the representee must communicate the intention to do so to the representor. Or may initiate proceedings for the rescission of the contract.

This is an equitable remedy, so given or withheld at the discretion of the court. Generally only awarded where parties can be restored to their original position. Reasons why potentially not awarded:

- Affirmation
	- Representee declaring intention to affirm, or doing some act from which such intention may reasonably be inferred.
- Lapse of time
	- Delay defeats equity
	- Lapse of time without attempt to effect rescission not itself affirmation, but could be treated as evidence for such an intention
- Restitution impossible
	- *restitutio in integrum* no longer possible ([[Clarke v Dickson (1858) EB & E 148]])
- Third party rights accrue
	- The contract remains valid up until the time notice is given of the intention to rescind. So at any time prior to rescission, a person acquiring goods under such a contract is able to pass good title to those goods to an innocent third party, who purchases the goods without notice of the misrepresentation.
	- This would prevent restitution

## Indemnity

As part of the equitable process of rescission, an indemnity may be awarded to cover expenses for obligations assumed as a direct result of the contract. The obligations must have been created by the contract.

Generally, where an action for misrepresentation will give a right to damages, an indemnity will not be awarded. No damages are available for an innocent misrepresentation, so here an action of indemnity is more likely to be awarded. Note the distinction between an indemnity and the common law right to damages ([[Whittington v Seale‑Hayne (1900) 82 LT 49]]).

## Damages

Damages are potentially the greatest where the misrepresentation is fraudulent. But damages for an action for negligent misrepresentation will under s 2(1) MA 1967 often match those available for fraudulent misrepresentation. Damages in lieu of rescission may be available under s 2(2) MA 1967.

Innocent misrepresentation does not afford any damages per se, but damages in lieu of rescission may be available under s 2(2) MA 1967.

### Damages for Fraudulent Misrepresentation

Fraudulent misrepresentation is part of the tort of deceit, so damages will be calculated on a tortious basis. The measure of damages is that which is necessary to place the innocent injured party in the position they would have been in had the misrepresentation not been made.

Held in [[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd [1969] 2 QB 158]] that claimant can recover

>“…all the damage directly flowing from the tortious act of fraudulent inducement which was not rendered too remote by the plaintiff's own conduct, whether or not the defendant could have foreseen the loss.”

Requirements have since been added:

- That the claimant must mitigate as soon as the fraud is discovered
- That any damages awarded to the claimant will be reduced by the value of any benefit the claimant has acquired as a result of the contract

[[Contributory negligence]] is **not** available as a defence to a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation ([[Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (No.2) [2003] 1 AC 959]]).

### Damages for Negligent Misrepresentation

#### S 2(1) Damages

 s 2(1) CA 1967:

> “Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.”

In [[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson [1991] 2 QB 297]] the court confirmed that the effect of this statute is that the correct measure of damages for negligent misrepresentation must be based on the tort of deceit (not the tort of negligence). This implies that the claimant is entitled to recover all losses, even if those losses are unforeseeable. Note that this draws no distinction between the honest and careless representor, and the fraudulent representor (which is criticised). But for negligent misrepresentation, damages may be reduced for [[Contributory negligence]].

#### S 2(2) Damages

 s 2(2) CA 1967:

 > “Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him otherwise than fraudulently, and he would be entitled by reason of the misrepresentation, to rescind the contract, then, if it is claimed, in any proceedings arising out of the contract, that the contract ought to be or has been rescinded, the court or arbitrator may declare the contract subsisting and award damages in lieu of rescission, if of the opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party.”

Remedy of damages in lieu of rescission only available at the discretion of the court, and only available for negligent and innocent misrepresentation.

The court must consider various factors ([[UCB Corporate Services v Thomason [2005] 1 All ER (Comm) 601]]):

- The nature and seriousness of the misrepresentation
- The loss that would be caused if the contract were upheld
- The loss that rescission would cause the other party

#### Distinction

Note that s 2(2) damages are a separate award of damages to those awarded under s 2(1)

Damages awarded | Rationale
---|---
s 2(1) damages | Intended to compensate the claimant for the loss directly flowing from the negligent misrepresentation.
s 2(2) damages | Intended to compensate the representee where the court has decided, at its discretion, not to award rescission.

Where damages in lieu of rescission are awarded, the damages awarded under s 2(1) will be reduced to reflect those awarded under s 2(2) (as explained by s 2(3))

### Damages for Innocent Misrepresentation

Where an innocent misrepresentation has been made, the representee is only entitled to the remedy of rescission and, if applicable, an indemnity to cover the cost of the legal obligations arising from the contract entered into. There is no automatic right to damages for an innocent misrepresentation. But, as with negligent misrepresentation, the court has the discretion under s 2(2) to award damages in lieu of rescission. Note [[Contributory negligence]] cannot be claimed for innocent misrepresentation.

## Misrepresentation and Exemption Clauses

If a contract contains [[Exemption Clauses]] purporting to protect a party from liability for misrepresenting, or purporting to exclude or restrict any remedy available to the other party, the clause will be of no effect except in so far as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness (s 3 MA 1967 as substituted by s 8 [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]]). The requirement of reasonableness comes from [s 11(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/section/11).

### Non-reliance Clauses

It is doubtful whether an 'entire agreement' clause would be sufficient to exclude liability for any misrepresentation. A possible boilerplate clause excluding this liability could be

> The parties agree and confirm that neither party has made any representations to the other in relation to this contract or its subject matter, and neither has any party relied on any representation from the other in entering into this contract.

The court will not allow liability for fraudulent misrepresentation to be avoided in this way.
