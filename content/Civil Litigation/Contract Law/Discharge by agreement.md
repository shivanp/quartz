# Discharge by agreement

A contractual obligation may be discharged by agreement. Happens in two ways:

- By a subsequent binding contract between the parties
- By operation of a term of the original contract.

## Subsequent Binding Contract

Where both parties have obligations which remain unperformed, the contract may be discharged by **mutual waiver**. This is a new contract by which each party agrees to waive their rights under the old contract in consideration for being released from their obligations under the old contract. Very common in commercial situations.

For the discharge to be effective, need to have:

- Accord (agreement the obligation will be released), and
- Satisfaction (consideration for the promise to release a party from the obligation).

So this works well in the mutual waiver situation:

| Accord | Satisfaction |
| ------ | ------------ |
|A agrees to release B from its obligations under the old contract | B agrees to release A from its obligations under the old contract.

But when things are one-sided:

| Accord | Satisfaction |
| ------ | ------------ |
|A agrees to release B from its obligations under the old contract. | Arguably, there is no satisfaction.

### Resolution 1

The party to whom the obligation is owed may release the other party by a subsequent **agreement under deed**. This avoids the need for consideration altogether, because a gratuitous promise (one without consideration) is enforceable if it is made in a contract in the form of a deed.

There is no need for accord and satisfaction when a party is released from an obligation by deed.

### Resolution 2

Alternatively, the party to whom the obligation is owed may provide consideration by agreeing with the other party to **accept something different** in place of the former obligation, for example the accelerated payment of a sum payable in instalments.

Essential point: unless there is a new consideration, there can be no satisfaction.

## Discharge by the Operation of a Term in the Contract

Such a term can be either a condition precedent or a condition subsequent.

### Condition Precedent

> A condition which must be satisfied before any rights come into existence.

 Where the coming into existence of a contract is subject to the occurrence of a specific event, the contract is said to be subject to a condition precedent. The contract is suspended until the condition is satisfied. Where a condition precedent is not fulfilled, there is no true discharge because the rights and obligations under the contract were contingent upon an event which did not occur, i.e., the rights and obligations never came into existence in the first place.

 

### Condition Subsequent

 
 > A term providing for the termination of the contract and the discharge of obligations outstanding, in the event of a specified occurrence  
 > [[Head v Tattersall (1871) LR 7 Ex 7]]

# Practicalities

- Commonly, there is a term in the contract which provides the right for one or both parties to end the agreement by giving notice to the other party.
- It is also possible to have a clause entitling a party to give notice to terminate the contract if the other party commits a breach of contract of a specified seriousness.
- Or, inclusion of a termination clause specifying that the contract will come to an end upon the occurrence of specified events (like on a certain date)
- In appropriate cases, the court will imply such a term
