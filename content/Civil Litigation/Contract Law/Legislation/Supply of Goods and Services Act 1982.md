# Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982

Provides for the implication of terms in

- Certain contracts for transfer of property in goods
- Contracts for hire of goods
- Contracts for supply of services

Implied terms do not apply to consumer contracts defined in Consumer Rights Act 2015.

## Contracts for Transfer of Property in Goods

A contract under which one person transfers or agrees to transfer to another the property in goods, **other than** any of the following (s 1):

- Contract of sale of goods
- Hire purchase agreement
- Contract under which property in goods is or is to be transferred in exchange for trading stamps
- Transfer made by deed for which there is no consideration other than presumed consideration
- Contract intended to operate by way of security

In any contract for transfer of goods, terms will be implied corresponding to those implied in case of contracts for sale of goods (title (s 2), description (s 3), quality and fitness of purpose (s 4), transfer by sample where applicable (s 5)).

## Contracts for Hire of Goods

 Means a contract under which one person bails or agrees to bail goods to another by way of hire (s 6) other than the following:

 - Hire purchase agreement, and
 - Contract under which goods bailed in exchange for trading stamps

In any contract for hire of goods, terms will be implied corresponding to those implied in the case of contracts for the sale of goods, including

- implied terms about the right to transfer possession (s 7)
- implied terms where hire is by description (s 8)
- implied terms about quality or fitness (s 9)
- implied terms where hire is by sample (s 10)

## Contracts for the Supply of Services

SGSA provides implied terms:

- **Care and skill**: where supplier acting in course of business, implied term that the supplier will carry out service with reasonable care and skill (s 13)
- **Time of performance**: where supplier acting in course of business and time for service not fixed by contract, implied term that supplier will carry out service within a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact. (s 14)
- **Consideration**: where consideration for service not determined by contract, implied term that party contracting with supplier will pay a reasonable charge. What is a reasonable charge is a question of fact. (s 15)

## Contracting Out These Terms

- For contracts for transfer of goods or hire of goods, under s 11 the supplier may negative or vary these terms, subject to provisions of Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.
- For contracts for supply of services, under s 16, a party may contract out implied terms set out, subject to provisions of UCTA.
- But UCTA pretty toothless

## Classification of Terms

s 13 SGSA is an **innominate term**.
