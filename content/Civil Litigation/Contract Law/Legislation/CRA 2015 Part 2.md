# CRA 2015 Part 2

## Scope

CRA regulates unfair terms in two areas:

- It regulates attempts to exclude/ limit liability for breach of contract (similar to [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]], just for consumer contracts)
- It regulates unfair terms more generally

There is no distinction here between contracts on standard terms and those that have been individually negotiated.

## Breach of Contract Liability

Negligence defined in s 65(4) as breach of:

> - (a) Any obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in the performance of a contract where the obligation arises from an express or implied term of the contract,
> - (b) A common law duty to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill,
> - (c) The common duty of care imposed by the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957

(b) is the tort of negligence, (a) is duties of care imposed by contract. Recall, s 49 [[CRA 2015 Part 1]] implies a term into a contract for the supply of a service that the supplier will carry out the service with reasonable skill and care. So, breach of such a term would constitute negligence for purposes of CRA.

### Death or Personal Injury Resulting From Negligence

s 65(1):

> A trader cannot be a term of a consumer contract or by a consumer notice exclude or restrict liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence.

So any attempts to exclude liability like this will not be binding on the consumer.

### Implied Terms About Goods

s 31 (1):

> A term of a contract to supply goods is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude or restrict the trader’s liability arising under any of these provisions—
> - (a) section 9 (goods to be of satisfactory quality);
> - (b) section 10 (goods to be fit for particular purpose);
> - (c) section 11 (goods to be as described);

### Implied Terms About Digital Content

s 47(1):

> A term of a contract to supply digital content is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude or restrict the trader’s liability arising under any of these provisions—
> - (a) section 34 (digital content to be of satisfactory quality),
> - (b) section 35 (digital content to be fit for particular purpose),
> - (c) section 36 (digital content to be as described),

### Implied Terms About Services

s 57(1):

>A term of a contract to supply services is not binding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude the trader’s liability arising under section 49 (service to be performed with reasonable care and skill).

This section is complicated but:

- Any attempt to **entirely exclude** section 49 will **not** be binding
- Any attempt to **restrict/ limit liability** under section 49 will **not be binding to the extent that it would prevent consumer from recovering price paid**. So liability cannot be limited to less than price paid.

(interpret these in the logical way)

## Regulation of Other Unfair Terms

s 62(1):

>An unfair term of a consumer contract is not binding on the consumer.

Note this applies to **any** term. But this is limited by s 64(1):

> A term of a consumer contract may not be assessed for fairness under section 62 to the extent that—
> - (a) it specifies the main subject matter of the contract, or
> - (b) the assessment is of the appropriateness of the price payable under the contract by comparison with the goods, digital content or services supplied under it.

The above holds provided that the terms are **transparent** and **prominent** (s 64).

Unfairness if defined in s 62(4):

> A term is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer.

This is judged at the time the contract is entered into.

[Part 1 Schedule 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/schedule/2/enacted) contains a list of terms which 'may be regarded as unfair'. Interesting inclusion:

>A term which has the object or effect of inappropriately excluding or limiting the legal rights of the consumer in relation to the trader or another party in the event of total or partial non-performance or inadequate performance by the trader of any of the contractual obligations.

## Anti-avoidance Provisions

CRA restricts the parties' contractual freedom. Generally it tries to cover all the loopholes parties may try to use to get around this too, e.g.,

- Using a secondary separate contract containing terms pertaining to the restriction of liabilities (prohibited under s 72)
- Making the liability or its enforcement subject to certain onerous conditions (generally prohibited under s 31(2))
