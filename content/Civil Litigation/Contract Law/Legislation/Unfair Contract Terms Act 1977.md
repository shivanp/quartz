# Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977

## Purpose

From preamble of [UCTA 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/contents):

> An Act to impose further limits on the extent to which … liability for breach of contract, or for negligence or other breach of duty, can be avoided by means of contract terms and otherwise.

Provisions ensure:

- Certain types of exemption clause have no effect
- Other types of exemption clause are effective only so far as they satisfy the requirements of reasonableness

## Scope

### Consumer Contracts

Provisions do not apply to 'consumer contracts'; these are instead governed by [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]].

### Business Liability

s 1(3):

>In the case of both contract and tort, sections 2 to 7 apply (except where the contrary is stated in section 6(4)) only to ==business liability==, that is liability for breach of obligations or duties arising—

>- (a) from things done or to be done by a person in the course of a business (whether his own business or another’s); or

>- (b) from the occupation of premises used for business purposes of the occupier;

The effect of this is:

Number of parties acting in the course of a business | Statutory regime applicable
---|---
Both parties | UCTA
One party | CRA 2015
Neither party | Neither statutory regime applies

### Unfair Clauses

Also note, UCTA **only applies to exemption clauses** (those which limit or exclude liability, either directly or indirectly), not to all 'unfair' clauses.

## Negligence Liability

s 1(1):

>For the purposes of this Part of this Act, “negligence” means the breach—

>- (a) of any obligation, arising from the express or implied terms of a contract, to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in the performance of the contract;

>- (b) of any common law duty to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill (but not any stricter duty);

(a) covers duties of care imposed by contract (e.g., a breach of s 13 of Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, to carry out a service in the course of business with reasonable skill and care). (b) is the tort of negligence!

### Exempting Liability for Losses Resulting From Negligence

s 2(1):

>A person cannot by reference to any contract term or to a notice given to persons generally or to particular persons exclude or restrict his liability for **death or personal injury** resulting from negligence.

Accordingly, any attempt to exclude or restrict liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence will be void.

s 2(2):

>In the case of **other loss or damage**, a person cannot so exclude or restrict his liability for negligence, except in so far as the term or notice satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

### Exempting Liability for Breach of Statutory Implied Terms About Quality of Goods

s 6(1a):  
Liability for breach of s 13-15 of [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] (conformity with description or sample, quality or fitness for a particular purpose),

>[…] cannot be excluded or restricted by reference to a contract term except in so far as the term satisfies the requirement of **reasonableness**.

### Exempting Liability Arising in Contract

s 3:

> (1)This section applies as between contracting parties where one of them deals … on the other’s ==written standard terms== of business.  
> (2)As against that party, the other cannot by reference to any contract term
> - (a) when himself in breach of contract, exclude or restrict any liability of his in respect of the breach; or
> - (b) claim to be entitled—
> 	- (i) to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of him, or
> 	- (ii) in respect of the whole or any part of his contractual obligation, to render no performance at all,  
> except in so far as (in any of the cases mentioned above in this subsection) the contract term satisfies the requirement of **reasonableness**.

'Written standard terms of business' is not defined, but the court uses a common sense approach. In [[St Albans City Council v. International Computers Ltd [1995] FSR 686]] held that even where a party's general terms had been the subject of negotiation, they were still dealing on standard terms for purposes of UCTA as terms remained effectively untouched.

Recently: if exemption clauses are from one party's standard terms, then even if the other party negotiates other clauses, UCTA will apply ([[Commercial Management (Investments) Ltd v Mitchell Design and Construct Ltd [2016] EWHC 76 (TCC)]]).

Key requirement here is for dealing on 'written standard terms'. So, exclusions/ limitations of liability for breach of contract in individually negotiated business to business contracts are generally not regulated by UCTA. That is, unless they are regulated by other areas of UCTA, such as attempts to limit liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence.

## Reasonableness Test

Set out in s 11(1). To pass the test, the term:

>[…] shall have been a fair and reasonable one to be included having regard to the circumstances which were, or ought reasonably to have been, known to or in the contemplation of the parties ==when the contract was made==.

“Fair and reasonable” is a difficult test to apply. According to s 11(2), when applied to s 6-7, this should be considered alongside matters specified in Schedule 2 of the Act. Courts have clarified that Schedule 2 guidelines may be used more widely, at any time the UCTA reasonableness test is being applied ([[Stewart Gill Ltd v Horatio Myer & Co. Ltd [1992] 1 QB 600]]).

Guiding factors in Schedule 2:

- (a) the strength of the bargaining positions of the parties relative to each other, taking into account (among other things) alternative means by which the customer’s requirements could have been met;
- (b) whether the customer received an inducement to agree to the term, or in accepting it had an opportunity of entering into a similar contract with other persons, but without having a similar term;
- (c) whether the customer knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and the extent of the term (having regard, among other things, to any custom of the trade and any previous course of dealing between the parties);
- (d) where the term excludes or restricts any relevant liability if some condition was not complied with, whether it was reasonable at the time of the contract to expect that compliance with that condition would be practicable;
- (e) whether the goods were manufactured, processed or adapted to the special order of the customer.

Reasonableness in case law: [[George Mitchell (Chester Hall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd (1983) 2 AC 803]]. Lord Bridge emphasised that the question of whether an exemption clause is reasonable was largely down to judicial discretion. So

>“the appellate court should treat the original decision [of the trial judge] with the utmost respect and refrain from interference with it unless satisfied that it proceeded on some erroneous principle or was plainly and obviously wrong."

This suggests that there will be little precedent value in decisions themselves.
