# Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999

This is the most fundamental exception to the doctrine of [[Privity of Contract]]. The [Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/31/contents) allows a third party, in limited circumstances, to enforce a term of the contract to which they are not a party. This is the case even if the third party has not provided any consideration. Note, the Act does not allow a contract to be enforced against a third party.

s 7(1) CA 1999: the existing common law and statutory exceptions are preserved.

The Act leaves the common law unchanged for those contracts excluded from the operation of the Act by virtue of s 6. These include employment contracts and contracts between a company and its members.

## Circumstances of Application

s 1(1) and 1(2):

> (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person who is not a party to a contract (a “third party”) may in his own right enforce a term of the contract if—  
> 	(a) the contract expressly provides that he may, or  
> 	(b) subject to subsection (2), the term purports to confer a benefit on him.  
> (2) Subsection (1)(b) does not apply if on a proper construction of the contract it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party.

This creates a rebuttable presumption that the third party will be able to enforce the term. The presumption will be rebutted if the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by the third party.

This indicates that courts will be slow to hold that where the contract does purport to confer a benefit on a third party, there is no intention that the third party should have a right to enforce the term. In other words, the rebuttable presumption is in favour of the third party having a right to enforce the term, once the contract is found to purport to confer a benefit to a third party.

It is possible to explicitly exclude any possibility that an agreement has purported to confer a benefit on a third party with an 'exclusion of third party rights' clause, e.g.,

> For the purposes of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, this Agreement does not and is not intended to give any rights, or any right to enforce any of its provisions, to any person who is not a party to it.

And in practice this is done almost all the time, in the context of commercial contracts.

## Identification of Third Party

s 1(3):

>(3) The third party must be expressly identified in the contract by name, as a member of a class or as answering a particular description but need not be in existence when the contract is entered into.

There is no requirement that the third party be in existence at the date of the contract. So a right can be conferred on, e.g., an unborn child.

## Exemption/ Limitation Clauses

Importantly, the Act allows third parties to rely on exemption/ limitation clauses in contracts to which they are not a party, in the same way it allows them to enforce contractual terms (s 1(6)).

## Remedies Available to Third Party

The rights of third parties are protected from variation/extinction/rescission under s 2(1):

> Subject to the provisions of this section, where a third party has a right under section 1 to enforce a term of the contract, the parties to the contract may not, by agreement, rescind the contract, or vary it in such a way as to extinguish or alter his entitlement under that right, without his consent if—  
> (a) the third party has communicated his assent to the term to the promisor,  
> (b) the promisor is aware that the third party has relied on the term, or  
> (c) the promisor can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that the third party would rely on the term and the third party has in fact relied on it.

The third party may communicate assent by words or conduct (s 2(2)(a)), but if the assent is sent by post, it is not valid until received (s 2(2)(b)).

If the contracting parties wish to allow the variation/rescission without the consent of the third party, or in circumstances not provided for under statute, they can do so by including an express term in the contract (s 2(3)).

The court can dispense with the third party's consent

- where their whereabouts cannot reasonably be ascertained (s 2(4)(a)),
- where they are mentally incapable of giving their consent (s 2(4)(b)), or
- where their reliance on the term cannot be reasonably ascertained (s 2(5)).

In such circumstances, where the court or arbitral tribunal sees fit to dispense with such consent, it may impose such conditions, for example a requirement to pay compensation, as may be thought fit (s 2(6)).

By virtue of s 3, the promisor's defences against the third party are both the same as they would be against the promisee and anything specific that they may be able to claim against the third party.

Section 3(6) provides that a third party is not, by virtue of s 1, to be placed in a better position than if the third party had been a party to the contract themselves. If, as such a party, they would not for whatever reason have been able to enforce the term (including, in particular, a term to exclude or limit liability) then they may not enforce it under s 1. Obvious examples would include where the benefit to be given would have been illegal under the contract or where the third party lacks contractual capacity.

## Right of Promisee to Enforce Contract

As a breach of a relevant term could expose the promisor to actions by both the promisee and the third party, s 5 sets out to protect the promisor from double liability. It provides that any award to a third party may be reduced by the court or arbitral tribunal to such extent as is thought appropriate if the promisee has already recovered a sum in respect of the third party's loss or the expense incurred by the promisee in making good to the third party the default of the promisor.

## Applying the Legislation

The application of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 is potentially extremely wide. Practitioners must:

1. Identify relevant contracts.
2. Identify potentially relevant third parties: on whom do you want to confer rights and whose rights do you want to preserve?
3. Consider whether third parties should be given enforceable rights. It might be a question either of
	1. preserving an existing mechanism which circumvents the privity doctrine and confers a right on a third party;
	2. making the third party a contracting party in the first place; or,
	3. making use of the Act, either to give a third party the right to enforce a positive obligation or permitting a third party to avail itself of an exclusion or limitation of liability.
4. Consider whether, if enforceable rights are given to third parties, there should be any restrictions on their ability to enforce such rights.

Consideration will be given whether the Act should be excluded. There is a rebuttable presumption under the Act that if a term purports to confer a benefit on a third party, this will be enforceable. That is, the presumption holds unless it is clear from construction that the parties did not intend to confer such a benefit.
