# Discharge

Every contractual obligation gives rise to a corresponding contractual right. Where the obligation of one party is discharged, the corresponding right of the other party is extinguished. Where all obligations arising under a contract are discharged and all rights thus extinguished, the contract is discharged.

This should be distinguished from a contract being void, where it is treated as having no effect from the beginning (similar for voidable).

Ways to discharge a contract:

- [[Discharge by performance]]
- [[Discharge by agreement]]
- [[Discharge by breach]]
- [[Discharge by frustration]]
