# Remedies

Remedies include:

- Specific performance
	- Requiring the defendant to carry out his undertaking exactly according to the terms of the contract
- Injunction
	- Preventing the defendant from doing something which the contract says he may not do
- Damages
	- Aims to compensate the claimant for the damage, loss or injury it has suffered as a result of the defendant's breach.

## Assessment of Damages

### Purpose of Damages

The purpose of damages is purely compensatory; punishing the defendant is not the aim. A breach of contract is a civil wrong; it is not a criminal offence. Punitive damages cannot be awarded in a purely contractual action (unlike in tort, and unlike in Canada).

A claimant who has not suffered any loss from the breach is entitled to a judgment, but the damages recoverable will be nominal. These are a token amount (e.g., £1) awarded to acknowledge that there has been a breach of contract, where no other remedy is available.

The claim that contract law can be separated from the law of tort and the law of restitution rests, to a large extent, on the proposition that the law of contract seeks to fulfil the expectations engendered by a binding promise.

## Expectation Interest

The default approach to compensating the innocent party is putting the innocent party in the same position post-breach that they would have been in had the contract been performed (forward looking).

Often called protecting the innocent party's "expectation" interest: putting them in the position they expected to be in.

Leading authority: [[Robinson v Harman (1848) 1 Ex 850]]. Parke B stated:

> “The rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed”

This is normally what the innocent party will want. But it can be difficult to apply this principle in practice.

There are three alternative mechanisms for calculating the expectation interest:

- Cost of cure
- Diminution of value
- Loss of amenity

### Cost of Cure

This is the usual method of calculating the expectation interest in contracts involving defective works ([[Birse Construction Ltd v Eastern Telegraph Co Ltd [2004] EWHC 2512]]). This represents the cost of substitute/ remedial work required to put the claimant in the position they would have been in had the contract been properly performed.

The claimant must act reasonably in relation to the defective works ([[McGlinn v Waltham Contractors [2007] EWHC 149 (TCC)]]).

### Diminution of Value

Alternatively, the claimant's expectation interest may be calculated by reference to the difference in value between the performance received and that promised in the contract.

### Loss of Amenity

Key case: [[Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd v Forsyth [1996] AC 344]].

The loss of amenity measure developed in Ruxley is a reflection of the court's growing willingness to accept that a consumer should have an available remedy where their loss is not economic in value, but nevertheless has value to them.

Commercially, it is 'unusual, if not impossible' for damages to be awarded for loss of amenity ([[Regus (UK) Ltd v Epcot Solutions Ltd [2007] EWHC 938 (Comm)]]).

### Other Points

Note that distinguishing between diminution in value and cost of cure measures is only relevant where there is a disparity between the two. This arises where the breach of contract relates to a dispute with regard to a particular specification required by the purchaser.

So where this doesn't arise, just ask what the expectation loss is.

## Reliance Interest

Allows the claimant to recover the expenses which have been incurred in preparing for, or in part performance of, the contract which have been rendered pointless by the breach.

An inherently more cautious, backwards looking approach. Aims to put the claimant in the position they would have been in had they never contracted.

Reliance losses are more likely to become relevant because the courts will not award expectation damages if they are highly speculative. For instance, if it is hard to put a figure on the diminution in value or the loss of amenity.

The reliance interest only allows recovery of **wasted** expenditure, not all expenditure. This is true even if the expenditure is in relation to the contract.

It is possible to claim expenditure made before the contract was agreed too, provided it was reasonably in the contemplation of the parties as likely to be wasted if the contract were broken ([[Anglia Television Ltd v Reed [1972] 1 QB 60]]).

Reliance losses are losses incurred **prior to breach**, not those incurred as a consequence of breach. Losses incurred remedying defective performance are not, therefore, reliance losses.

The claimant can recover the reliance interest, provided that the defendant is unable to prove that they would not have recouped the expenditure had the contract gone ahead.

It is principally when the claimant has made a bad bargain that he will want to claim the reliance measure (to escape the consequences of this bad bargain).

## Particular Types of Loss

There are specific rules for certain kinds of loss, when it comes to putting the expectation measure of damages into effect.

### Damages for Mental Distress

General rule: damages will not be awarded in relation to mental distress, anguish, or annoyance caused by breach of contract ([[Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] AC 488]]).

Exceptions have developed to the general rule, meaning that in limited situations mental distress can be compensated.

Initially, such compensation was limited to cases involving contracts whose whole purpose was the provision of pleasure, relaxation and peace of mind ([[Jarvis v Swan Tours [1973] QB 233]]).

More recently, the House of Lords has allowed damages for non-pecuniary loss, where a major object of the contract was to provide pleasure, relaxation and peace of mind ([[Farley v Skinner (No. 2) [2001] UKHL 49]]).

### Damages for Loss of Reputation

General rule: damages not awarded.

But in [[Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International [1998] AC 20]] it was held that where an employer was dishonest, the employee could claim for reputational damage, due to a breach of the implied term of honesty between the parties.

### Damages for Loss of Chance

The loss of an opportunity is recoverable in damages if the lost chance is quantifiable in monetary terms and there was a real and substantial chance that the opportunity might have come to fruition. Otherwise, the loss of opportunity will be treated as too speculative.

Leading case: [[Chaplin v Hicks [1911] 2 KB 786]].

### Damages on Behalf of Another

General rule: damages cannot be recovered on behalf of another party/ for losses suffered by another party. There are exceptions relating to [[Privity of Contract]].

See [[Causation, remoteness, mitigation]].
