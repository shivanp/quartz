# County Court

Most civil claims begin in the County Court. There are County Courts across England and Wales.

## Tracks

There are three 'tracks' for cases in the county court:

- Small Claims Track
	- Small claims are those valued at < £10,000, or < £1,000 for personal injury claims
- Fast Track
- Multi Track

Each case is allocated a track depending on its financial value and complexity.

## Judges

Levels of judges in County Court:

- Deputy District Judges (DDJs)
	- Most junior
	- Fee paid (on a daily rate)
- District Judges (DJs)
	- Most judges in the County Court are District Judges
	- Mostly procedural work, hear some final hearings
- Circuit Judges (CJs)
	- Most senior County Court judges
	- Hear complex cases
	- Hear appeals from decisions by DJs and DDJs

Note, County Courts cannot create precedent, and are bound by the higher courts.
