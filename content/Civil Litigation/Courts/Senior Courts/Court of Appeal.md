# Court of Appeal

## Features

The Court of Appeal is based at the Royal Courts of Justice in London but has occasional sittings elsewhere in England and Wales. It consists of a Civil Division and a Criminal Division, which between them hear appeals on a wide range of cases covering civil, family and criminal justice. In some cases, a further appeal lies, with permission, to the Supreme Court, but in practice the Court of Appeal is the final court of appeal for the great majority of cases.

All Court of Appeal judges are senior judges with lengthy judicial experience. Appointment is by The Queen on the recommendation of a selection panel convened by the Judicial Appointments Commission.

The judges of the Court of Appeal are the Heads of Division (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Queen’s Bench Division, the President of the Family Division and the Chancellor of the High Court) and the Lords Justices of Appeal.

The Lord Justices of Appeal are referred to verbally as “Lord/Lady Justice [Surname]” or, in writing, as “[Surname] LJ”.

## Civil and Criminal Divisions

The Civil Division hears appeals from the High Court, County Courts (if judgement was given by a Circuit Judge) and certain tribunals such as the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.

It is headed by the Master of the Rolls. Cases are generally heard by three judges, consisting of any combination of the Heads of Division and Lords Justices of Appeal.

## Criminal Division

The Criminal Division hears appeals from the Crown Court. It is headed by the Lord Chief Justice, who is the Head of the Judiciary and President of the Courts of England and Wales. The Lord Chief Justice assumed the role of Head of the Judiciary following the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which changed the role of the Lord Chancellor from a mixed judicial and political one to a fully political one.

Cases in the Criminal Division are generally heard by three judges, consisting of the Lord Chief Justice or the President of the Queen’s Bench Division or one of the Lords Justices of Appeal, together with two High Court Judges or one High Court Judge and one specially nominated Senior Circuit Judge.
