# Magistrates' Court

- Lowest level court in the **criminal** hierarchy. Virtually all cases start in the Magistrates' Court, and around 95% end there.
- Tries all summary (minor) offences, and some triable either way (mid-range) offences
- Power to impose fine of Â£5000, and/ or 6 month prison sentence for single offence
- Can commit defendant to the [[Crown Court]] either for sentence or trial. This will be either because they do not have the power to impose a higher sentence, or because the offence is one triable either way and a Crown Court trial is more appropriate.
- The Magistrates' Court does not create precedent, but is bound by the Administrative Court, [[Court of Appeal]] and Supreme Court.

## Functions

1. Issuing search and arrest warrants
2. Issuing warrants for further detention under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
3. Trying summary offences and either way offences
4. Sending indictable-only offences and some either way offences to the Crown Court for trial.
5. Dealing with applications for a representation order; and
6. Dealing with applications for bail.

Most magistrates are not legally qualified! They are members of the local community who have volunteered their services. They will be advised on law, practice and procedure by a legal adviser.

Sometimes a legally qualified (solicitor/barrister) District Judge will hear cases.
