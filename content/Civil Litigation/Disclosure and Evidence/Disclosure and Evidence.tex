\hypertarget{purpose}{%
\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

Litigation cannot do real justice unless the court does not have all the
relevant information. Pre-action protocols require parties to share
information, but no general obligation to show the contents of
documents. The only way to compel disclosure of a document is by court
order. Disclosure and inspection enables parties to better evaluate the
strength of the opponent's case before trial. Intended to promote
settlements. But inspection is subject to restrictions.

The idea behind these steps is that each party should know, prior to
trial, the evidence that the other side intends to rely on--whether it
be documents, the recollection of a witness or the opinion of an expert.
This permits each party to prepare its case in full knowledge of the
evidence and avoids what is sometimes known as `trial by ambush', where
a party produces important new evidence for the first time at trial.

Statute: Part 31 CPR 1998. Applies to all claims except Small Claims
Track claims.

\hypertarget{disclosure-report}{%
\subsubsection{Disclosure Report}\label{disclosure-report}}

r 31.5(3): parties must file and serve a disclosure report \(\geq 14\)
days before first case management conference. Report should be in form
N263 and:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe of what documents exist or may exist which are or may be
  relevant to the matter
\item
  Describe where and with whom located
\item
  Describe how electronic documents stored
\item
  Estimate costs involved in giving standard disclosure
\item
  State disclosure directions sought
\item
  Verify with statement of truth.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{overriding-objective}{%
\subsubsection{Overriding Objective}\label{overriding-objective}}

Parties must \(\geq 7\) days before first case management conference
agree a proposal in relation to disclosure that meets the overriding
objective.

\hypertarget{possible-disclosure-directions}{%
\subsubsection{Possible Disclosure
Directions}\label{possible-disclosure-directions}}

r 31.5(7): these include

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Order dispensing with disclosure
\item
  Order that party disclose documents on which they rely
\item
  Order that directs disclosure to be given by each party, issue by
  issue
\item
  Order that each party disclosure documents which might reasonably
  contain information useful/ damaging to that party
\item
  Order for standard disclosure
\item
  Any other appropriate order.
\end{enumerate}

r 31.5(8): the court may specify searches to be carried out, formats for
documents, and other practical measures.

\hypertarget{standard-disclosure}{%
\subsection{Standard Disclosure}\label{standard-disclosure}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{title: r 31.6}

\NormalTok{    {-} (i) adversely affect his own case;}
\NormalTok{    {-} (ii) adversely affect another party’s case; or}
\NormalTok{    {-} (iii) support another party’s case; and}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{issues-in-dispute}{%
\subsubsection{Issues in Dispute}\label{issues-in-dispute}}

What is the `case'? See statements of case! No need to disclose
documents relating to issues which are in agreement. In most cases,
liability and quantum will be in dispute. But documents concerning costs
should also be included as part of standard disclosure.

Only need to search for documents which affect the case to a material
extent.

No need to disclose documents which only call into question the
reliability of a party/ their witnesses.

\hypertarget{control-of-documents}{%
\subsubsection{Control of Documents}\label{control-of-documents}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{title: r 31.8}
\NormalTok{(1) A party’s duty to disclose documents is limited to documents which are or have been in his control.}

\NormalTok{(2) For this purpose a party has or has had a document in his control if –}
\NormalTok{{-} (a) it is or was in his physical possession;}
\NormalTok{{-} (b) he has or has had a right to possession of it; or}
\NormalTok{{-} (c) he has or has had a right to inspect or take copies of it.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It is open to parties to agree in writing to dispense with/ limit
standard disclosure, though this is not common.

\hypertarget{disclosure-of-copies}{%
\subsection{Disclosure of Copies}\label{disclosure-of-copies}}

Just disclose a single copy of a document, unless there are any
modifications (e.g., handwritten notes).

\subsection{Duty to Search (r 31.7)}\label{duty-to-search-r-31.7}}

\hypertarget{reasonable-search}{%
\subsubsection{Reasonable Search}\label{reasonable-search}}

A party must make a reasonable search for all documents that could
adversely affect their own/ another party's case. Reasonableness depends
on:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Number of documents involved
\item
  Nature and complexity of case
\item
  Ease and expense of retrieval
\item
  Significance of document.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{electronic-documents}{%
\subsubsection{Electronic Documents}\label{electronic-documents}}

\textbf{PD 31B} sets out provisions. General principles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Manage efficiently
\item
  Use technology
\item
  Generally provide in a format providing the other party the same
  ability to access/ search/ review documents.
\item
  Don't disclose irrelevant documents.
\end{itemize}

Parties will agree categories of documents, preservation, keywords,
exchange of data etc. There is an optional Electronic Disclosure
Questionnaire.

\hypertarget{limits}{%
\subsubsection{Limits}\label{limits}}

If a party has limited their search, the limits must be disclosed in the
disclosure statement.

\hypertarget{right-of-inspection}{%
\subsection{Right of Inspection}\label{right-of-inspection}}

\textbf{Rule 31.3(1)} gives a party a right of inspection of a disclosed
document, except where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\alph{enumi})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the document is no longer in the control of the party who disclosed
    it (see 11.4);
  \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Individual Must Sign}\label{individual-must-sign}}

A party is under an obligation to disclose documents that might
adversely affect their own case or support another party's case. It is
essential that parties comply fully and honestly with the requirements
of disclosure.

Parties must produce a disclosure statement (r 31.10(5)):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Setting out the extent of the search that has been made to locate
  documents
\item
  Certifying that they understand the duty to disclose documents
\item
  Certifying that to the best of their knowledge, they have carried out
  that duty.
\end{itemize}

By \textbf{r 31.10(9)}, a disclosure statement may be made by a person
who is not a party only where this is permitted by a relevant Practice
Direction.

\hypertarget{continuing-obligation-r-31.11}{%
\subsection{Continuing Obligation (r

Disclosure is an obligation that continues until the proceedings are
concluded. If documents to which the duty of disclosure extends come to
a party's notice at any time during the proceedings, even though the
party has already supplied a list of documents, they must immediately
notify every other party.

If a document is found after a party's list of documents has been
served, and it satisfies the test in \textbf{r 31.6}, notice should be
given by way of letter or a supplemental list. If the party wishes to
rely on the document at trial, either the opponent will have to agree or
a successful application made to the court for permission to do so. Even
if permission is given, the opponent may still argue at trial that
little weight should be attached to the evidence.

\hypertarget{withholding-inspection}{%
\subsection{Withholding Inspection}\label{withholding-inspection}}

A party can withhold the right to inspect a document that has been
disclosed. Usually, a party claims the documents are privileged from
inspection.

3 classes of privileged documents:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Documents protected by legal professional privilege
\item
  Documents tending to incriminate the party producing them
\item
  Documents privileged on the grounds of public policy.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{legal-professional-privilege}{%
\subsubsection{Legal Professional
Privilege}\label{legal-professional-privilege}}

\hypertarget{advice-privilege}{%
\paragraph{Advice Privilege}\label{advice-privilege}}

Communication passing between a party and their legal advisor, or
between legal advisors.

Letters and other communications passing between a party and their
solicitor are privileged from inspection, provided they are written by
or to the solicitor in their professional capacity and for the
\textbf{sole or dominant purpose} of obtaining legal advice or
assistance for the client (``dominant purpose test'').

``Legal advice'' includes information passed between solicitor and
client, so advice may be sought and given.

But this is not a blanket exemption for all solicitor-client
communication; it applies only to information passed between the client
and a solicitor acting in the capacity of solicitor. Documents sent to
or from an independent third party are not covered by this privilege;
`copying in' a solicitor will not mean the information can be withheld.
If the communication is made for the purpose of committing a fraud or
crime, it will not attract privilege ({[}{[}R v Cox and Railton
(1884){]}{]}).

The privilege extends to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Communications between a party and their solicitor's employee/ agent,
\item
  Communications between a party and a solicitor in their service.
\item
  Communications from a solicitor to a third party containing
  information provided by the client to the solicitor which is covered
  by legal advice privilege and which the client has given the lawyer
  authority to disclose.
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{title: Purpose}
\NormalTok{To allow free access to the legal profession. }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

But the privilege does not extend to an accountant who provides legal
advice ({[}{[}R (on the application of Prudential Plc) v Special
Commissioner of Income Tax {[}2013{]} UKSC 1{]}{]}).

\hypertarget{solicitor-tp-litigation-privilege}{%
\paragraph{Solicitor-TP Litigation
Privilege}\label{solicitor-tp-litigation-privilege}}

Communications passing between the solicitor and a third party are
privileged from\\
inspection only if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  They come into existence after litigation is contemplated or
  commenced; and
\item
  They are made with a view to the litigation, either for the
  \textbf{sole or dominant purpose} of obtaining or giving advice in
  regard to it, or for obtaining evidence to be used in it.
\end{enumerate}

This includes, for example, an AEI policy.

\hypertarget{client-tp-litigation-privilege}{%
\paragraph{Client-TP Litigation
Privilege}\label{client-tp-litigation-privilege}}

Documents that have passed between the client and a third party are
privileged if the \textbf{sole or dominant purpose} for which they were
produced was to obtain legal advice in respect of existing or
contemplated litigation, or to conduct, or aid in the conduct of, such
litigation, usually to have as evidence.

The burden is on the party claiming privilege to establish that the
dominant purpose, at the time the document came into existence, was
litigation. An expert report commissioned by the client and later used
for litigation is not good enough.

Where the claimant is not an individual, the privilege applies to
communications between individuals within an organisation, where the
dominant purpose of communications was in obtaining legal advice in
respect of existing or contemplated litigation.

intends to rely on at trial.

\hypertarget{incriminating-documents}{%

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Statement made outside court, repeated by the witness in court, and the
purpose of repeating the statement is to prove the truth of the
statement. Start point in civil proceedings: hearsay is admissible,
provided that it is relevant and not opinion. Can have ``documentary
hearsay'' - producing a document to prove that it exists.

Hearsay is an oral or written statement made outside the courtroom,
where a statement is ``any representation of fact or opinion'' (s 13 CEA
1995). The statement constituting hearsay evidence must itself
constitute admissible evidence.

Any opinion must be that of a non-expert based on that person's
perception. Hearsay provisions cannot be used to adduce expert evidence,
either by way of inclusion in the witness statement or as an exhibit to
it.

If the expert is unsure of the nature of these obligations, they may

be completely objective and unbiased in the way in which they provide
their opinion for the benefit of the court (see {[}{[}Stevens v Gullis

on issues concerning the credibility of a party or the reliability of a
party's evidence (see {[}{[}Radia v Marks {[}2022{]} EWHC 145
(QB){]}{]}).

An expert is not disqualified by the fact of being employed by one of
