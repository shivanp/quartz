## Court Powers

- To be admissible, evidence must be **relevant** ([[O'Brien v Chief Constable of South Wales Police (2005)]])
- Part 32-33 CPR 1998
- The court can control evidence brought before it
- Even if evidence is relevant, the court can still decide to exclude it on case management grounds.

> [!statute] r 32.1 - Power of court to control evidence
> 
> (1) The court may control the evidence by giving directions as to –
> - (a) the issues on which it requires evidence;
> - (b) the nature of the evidence which it requires to decide those issues; and
> - (c) the way in which the evidence is to be placed before the court.
> 
> (2) The court may use its power under this rule to exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible.
> 
> (3) The court may limit cross-examination

> [!statute] r 32.2(3)
> The court may give directions –
> - (a) identifying or limiting the issues to which factual evidence may be directed;
> - (b) identifying the witnesses who may be called or whose evidence may be read; or
> - (c) limiting the length or format of witness statements.

The court may limit exclude evidence pertaining to a particular issue it considers no longer relevant, or prescribe a list of relevant issues. A party can appeal such an order.

The court will consider the credibility of a witness when weighing up a piece of evidence.

## Witness Evidence

### General Rule

> [!statute] r 32.2
> The general rule is that any fact which needs to be proved by the evidence of witnesses is to be proved –
> - (a) at trial, by their oral evidence given in public; and
> - (b) at any other hearing, by their evidence in writing.

**r 32.5(2)** provides another general rule, that where a witness is called to give oral evidence, their witness statement will stand as their evidence in chief. No party should include in any witness statement evidence which the maker of the statement could not give orally (see [[JD Wetherspoon plc v Harris (Practice Note) [2013] EWHC 1088 (Ch)]]).

### Pre-trial Exchange

**Rule 32.4(2)** states that the court will order a party to serve on the other parties any witness statement of the oral evidence upon which the party serving the statement intends to rely in relation to any issue of fact to be decided at the trial.

> [!note]
> Where a witness statement is not served, the witness will be allowed to give evidence at trial only with the court’s permission.

Usually the court will order simultaneous exchange of witness statements, but exceptionally it will order sequential exchange (with the claimant usually serving witness statements first).

### Objections

> [!question] What if you object to the relevance/ admissibility of material in opponent's witness statement?
> 1. Notify other party and seek to resolve
> 2. Raise matter at pre-trial review/ trial. 

### Additional Evidence

If a party wants a witness to give additional evidence following exchange of witness statements, serve a supplemental witness statement as soon as possible. Ask the other party to agree to the evidence being adduced at trial, and if they don't, raise the matter at pre-trial review/ trial.

## Form of Witness Statements

### Structure

**PD 32 paras 17-20**.

The witness statement should be headed with the title of the proceedings (PD 32 para 17.1),

> [!statute] PD 32 para 17.2
> At the top right hand corner of the first page there should be clearly written:
> 1. the party on whose behalf it is made,
> 2. the initials and surname of the witness,
> 3. the number of the statement in relation to that witness,
> 4. the identifying initials and number of each exhibit referred to,
> 5. the date the statement was made; and
> 6. the date of any translation.

- Divide witness statement into numbered paragraphs (para 19.1(5))
- Express numbers as figures (19.1(6))
- Generally follow a chronological sequence, with each paragraph confined to a distinct subject (para 19.2)
- Draft in the witness's own language.
	- If in a foreign language:
		- Have the statement translated,
		- Translator signs to certify accuracy
		- File original and translation.

### Content

- Statement should be in witness's own words as far as practicable (para 18.1).
	- Don't include complex legal arguments which the witness would not be able to speak about if cross examined.
	- Written in first person
	- Should state
		- Full name of witness
		- Address
		- Occupation
		- If they are a party/ employee of a party
		- Process by which witness statement was prepared (e.g., face-to-face).
- If there is any defect in the witness statement, the court may refuse to admit it as evidence and may refuse to allow costs arising from its preparation (**para 25.1**).
	- If you spot this, first raise with the other side and attempt agreement,
	- Then seek assistance of the court.
- The statement must indicate which of the statements are based on the witness’s own knowledge and which are matters of information or belief, and the source of the witness’s information and belief (PD 32 para 18.2)
- Exhibits (PD 32, paras 18.3 and 18.6)
	- Any exhibit used in connection with a witness statement should be verified and identified by the witness and remain separate from the statement.
	- Number the exhibits (across all witnesses)
- Statement of truth (para 20.2)
	- In witness's own language
	- “I believe that the facts stated in this witness statement are true. I understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.”
- **Rule 22.3**: if the maker of a witness statement fails to verify the witness statement by a statement of truth, the court may direct that it shall not be admissible as evidence.

## Witness Statements at Trial

The witness will usually be called to give oral evidence at trial, unless the court orders otherwise or the party uses the statement as hearsay evidence.

The witness will be asked to confirm that their witness statement is true, before cross-examination by the other side.

### Additional Evidence-in-chief

The witness statement will stand as the evidence-in-chief of the witness, unless the court orders otherwise. Ensure the statement is comprehensive.

> [!statute] r 32.5(3)
> A witness giving oral evidence at trial may with the permission of the court –
> - (a) amplify his witness statement; and
> - (b) give evidence in relation to new matters which have arisen since the witness statement was served on the other parties.

This will only be granted if there is a good reason why evidence was not dealt with in the witness statement.

### Use by Opponent

If a party who has served a witness statement does not call the witness or use the statement as hearsay evidence, any other party may use the witness statement as hearsay evidence (r 32.5(5)).

## Witness Summaries (r 32.9)

It can be difficult to persuade a witness to give a witness statement. If there is a witness who does not want to give a witness statement, an application to court can be made for an order to serve a witness summary.

> [!statute] r 32.9 - witness summaries
> (1) A party who –
> - (a) is required to serve a witness statement for use at trial; but
> - (b) is unable to obtain one, may apply, without notice, for permission to serve a witness summary instead.
> 
> (2) A witness summary is a summary of –
> - (a) the evidence, if known, which would otherwise be included in a witness statement; or
> - (b) if the evidence is not known, the matters about which the party serving the witness summary proposes to question the witness.
> 
> (3) Unless the court orders otherwise, a witness summary must include the name and address of the intended witness.
> 
> (4) Unless the court orders otherwise, a witness summary must be served within the period in which a witness statement would have had to be served.
> 
> (5) Where a party serves a witness summary, so far as practicable rules 32.4 (requirement to serve witness statements for use at trial), 32.5(3) (amplifying witness statements), and 32.8 (form of witness statement) shall apply to the summary.

Issues raised:

1. Whether the applicant has shown an inability to obtain a witness statement
	1. Test must be applied with rigour
	2. But it can be met if the court agrees that had a request been made, it would have been turned down.
2. Extent to which the proposed witness is likely to be able to give relevant evidence
3. Whether allowing summary is compatible with the overriding objective
4. Adequacy of summary's content.

## Sanctions for Not Serving Witness Statement (r 32.10)

> [!statute] r 32.10 - Consequence of failure to serve witness statement or summary
> If a witness statement or a witness summary for use at trial is not served in respect of an intended witness within the time specified by the court, then the witness may not be called to give oral evidence unless the court gives permission.

> [!question] If a party knows they will miss deadline to exchange?
> 1. Contact other party and seek agreement to extension
> 2. Determine when signed statement will be available
> 3. If no agreement is reached/ affects a key case management date, apply immediately to the court with supporting evidence providing an explanation for the need for the extension. 

> [!question] If a party knows opponent will miss exchange deadline?
> File statements with court and explain situation in a covering letter. 

It is unlikely that the court will allow serving a new witness statement after witness exchange, bearing in mind the overriding objective.

## Affidavits

> [!defn]
> Sworn statement of evidence (ie, the maker of the affidavit has to swear before a solicitor (not their own), or other authorised person, that the contents of the affidavit are true).

The Rules provide that if you are applying for a freezing injunction or search order, the evidence in support of such an application must be by way of affidavit rather than a witness statement.

## Opinion Evidence

### Relevant Facts Personally Perceived

The general rule is that opinion evidence is not admissible. But there may be situations in which it is difficult for the witness to separate fact and opinion (e.g., “I was driving at about 60mph”, “John was drunk”).

> [!statute] s 3(2) Civil Evidence Act 1972
> It is hereby declared that where a person is called as a witness in any civil proceedings, a statement of opinion by him on any relevant matter on which he is not qualified to give expert evidence, if made as a way of conveying relevant facts personally perceived by him, is admissible as evidence of what he perceived.

## Hearsay Evidence

> [!defn] Hearsay
> A statement made otherwise than by a person while giving oral evidence in the proceedings which is tendered as evidence of the matters stated (s 1(2)(a) Civil Evidence Act 1995). 

Statement made outside court, repeated by the witness in court, and the purpose of repeating the statement is to prove the truth of the statement. Start point in civil proceedings: hearsay is admissible, provided that it is relevant and not opinion. Can have “documentary hearsay” - producing a document to prove that it exists.

Hearsay is an oral or written statement made outside the courtroom, where a statement is “any representation of fact or opinion” (s 13 CEA 1995). The statement constituting hearsay evidence must itself constitute admissible evidence.

Any opinion must be that of a non-expert based on that person’s perception. Hearsay provisions cannot be used to adduce expert evidence, either by way of inclusion in the witness statement or as an exhibit to it.

> [!test] Admissible hearsay
> Answer all the following affirmatively: 
> 1. Is the evidence oral/ written evidence heard outside the courtroom?
> 2. Is the statement being presented to the court to prove that it is true?
> 3. Is the statement an admissible statement of fact, not opinion?

Hearsay can be first-hand (“X told me”) or multiple (“X told me that Y told her”).

### Using Hearsay

#### Notice Requirements

> [!statute] s 1(1) Civil Evidence Act 1995
> In civil proceedings evidence shall not be excluded on the ground that it is hearsay.

> [!statute] s 2(1) Civil Evidence Act 1995 - notice of proposal to adduce hearsay evidence
> (1) A party proposing to adduce hearsay evidence in civil proceedings shall, subject to the following provisions of this section, give to the other party or parties to the proceedings—
> - (a) such notice (if any) of that fact, and
> - (b) on request, such particulars of or relating to the evidence,
> 
> as is reasonable and practicable in the circumstances for the purpose of enabling him or them to deal with any matters arising from its being hearsay. 

Read in conjunction with:

> [!statute] r 33.2 CPR 1995 - Notice of intention to rely on hearsay evidence
> (1) Where a party intends to rely on hearsay evidence at trial and either –
> - (a) that evidence is to be given by a witness giving oral evidence; or
> - (b) that evidence is contained in a witness statement of a person who is not being called to give oral evidence;
> 
> that party complies with section 2(1)(a) of the Civil Evidence Act 19951 serving a witness statement on the other parties in accordance with the court’s order.
> 
> (2) Where paragraph (1)(b) applies, the party intending to rely on the hearsay evidence must, when he serves the witness statement –
> - (a) inform the other parties that the witness is not being called to give oral evidence; and
> - (b) give the reason why the witness will not be called.
> 
> (3) In all other cases where a party intends to rely on hearsay evidence at trial, that party complies with section 2(1)(a) of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 by serving a notice on the other parties which –
> - (a) identifies the hearsay evidence;
> - (b) states that the party serving the notice proposes to rely on the hearsay evidence at trial; and
> - (c) gives the reason why the witness will not be called.
> 
> (4) The party proposing to rely on the hearsay evidence must –
> - (a) serve the notice no later than the latest date for serving witness statements; and
> - (b) if the hearsay evidence is to be in a document, supply a copy to any party who requests him to do so.

#### Failure to Comply

> [!statute] s 2(4) CEA 1995
> A failure to comply with subsection (1), or with rules under subsection (2)(b), does not affect the admissibility of the evidence but may be taken into account by the court—
> - (a) in considering the exercise of its powers with respect to the course of proceedings and costs, and
> - (b) as a matter adversely affecting the weight to be given to the evidence in accordance with section 4. 

### Weight of Hearsay

#### Second-best

Less likely to be true or accurate than full witness statements. Judge will consider:

1. What issue does the hearsay address?
2. How important is the issue to the case?
3. What other evidence is available on the same issue?
4. Could the proponent have obtained better evidence through reasonable effort?

#### Guidelines

> [!statute] s 4 CEA 1995 -  Considerations relevant to weighing of hearsay evidence
> (1) In estimating the weight (if any) to be given to hearsay evidence in civil proceedings the court shall have regard to any circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the reliability or otherwise of the evidence.
> 
> (2) Regard may be had, in particular, to the following—
> - (a) whether it would have been reasonable and practicable for the party by whom the evidence was adduced to have produced the maker of the original statement as a witness;
> - (b) whether the original statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the matters stated;
> - (c) whether the evidence involves multiple hearsay;
> - (d) whether any person involved had any motive to conceal or misrepresent matters;
> - (e) whether the original statement was an edited account, or was made in collaboration with another or for a particular purpose;
> - (f) whether the circumstances in which the evidence is adduced as hearsay are such as to suggest an attempt to prevent proper evaluation of its weight.

## Expert Evidence (Part 35)

### Duty of an Expert

> [!statute] r 35.3 - Experts – overriding duty to the court
> (1) It is the duty of experts to help the court on matters within their expertise.
> 
> (2) This duty overrides any obligation to the person from whom experts have received instructions or by whom they are paid.

If the expert is unsure of the nature of these obligations, they may file a request for directions from the court. Experts should, therefore, be completely objective and unbiased in the way in which they provide their opinion for the benefit of the court (see [[Stevens v Gullis [1999] BLR 394]]). Likewise, it is not for an expert to comment on issues concerning the credibility of a party or the reliability of a party’s evidence (see [[Radia v Marks [2022] EWHC 145 (QB)]]).

An expert is not disqualified by the fact of being employed by one of the parties, although the court will need to be satisfied that the expert was sufficiently aware of their responsibilities to the court ([[Field v Leeds City Council [2000] 1 EGLR 54]]).

#### Impropriety

- An expert who behaves improperly is likely to be reported to their governing body by the trial judge at the end of the hearing ([[Meadow v General Medical Council [2006] EWCA Civ 1390]]).
- If an expert's improper behaviour wastes the costs of the opposing party, the expert may be ordered to contribute towards payment of these costs ([[Thimmaya v Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust (Manchester County Court, 30 January 2020]]).
- An expert who deliberately or recklessly makes a false statement in their report is likely to receive a custodial sentence for being in contempt of court ([[Liverpool Victoria Insurance Company Ltd v Zafar [2019] EWCA Civ 39]])

### Court's Power to Restrict

- r 35.1: expert evidence must be restricted to that which is reasonably required to resolve the proceedings.
- r 35.4: no party may call an expert or put in evidence an expert’s report without the court’s permission.
	- Permission usually granted at the directions stage.
	- Party must identify field of expert, and where possible, name of expert, issues they will address, and an estimate of costs.
- Court may direct:
	- No expert evidence allowed
	- Limit on number of experts each party may call
	- Directing that evidence is to be given by one or more experts chosen by agreement between parties.
	- Directing that some/ all experts shall give evidence concurrently.
	- Costs of expert that a party can recover to be limited.

### Instructions to Expert

> [!statute] r 35.10 - Contents of report
> (1) An expert’s report must comply with the requirements set out in Practice Direction 35.
> 
> (2) At the end of an expert’s report there must be a statement that the expert understands and has complied with their duty to the court.
> 
> (3) The expert’s report must state the substance of all material instructions, whether written or oral, on the basis of which the report was written.
> 
> (4) The instructions referred to in paragraph (3) shall not be privileged(GL) against disclosure but the court will not, in relation to those instructions –
> - (a) order disclosure of any specific document; or
> - (b) permit any questioning in court, other than by the party who instructed the expert,
> 
> unless it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to consider the statement of instructions given under paragraph (3) to be inaccurate or incomplete.

TLDR: instructions are privileged unless the court makes an order under the rule, which only happens when there are grounds for believing the expert's statement of instructions is inaccurate/ incomplete. A party is free to waive this privilege.

### Form

Expert evidence given in a written report unless the court directs otherwise. If to be relied upon at trial, the report must be disclosed to the other party in accordance with court instructions–usually for simultaneous mutual exchange.

### Contents

See PD 35 para 3.1 and 3.2. The report must:

1. Be addressed to the court
2. Contain:
	1. Details of qualifications
	2. Literature relied upon
	3. Statement of facts/ instructions
	4. Set out limits of expertise
	5. Say who carried out examinations, tests etc.
	6. Summarise opinions and reasons
	7. Summarise conclusions
	8. State qualifications with which any opinions are given
	9. Statement that expert understands duty to court and is aware of requirements upon them.
3. Be verified with a statement of truth.

If the expert has any conflicts of interest, this does not automatically disqualify them, but details of the conflict should be raised at an early stage.

### Questions to Expert

The other party may put written questions to the expert about their report:

- May only be put once
- Must be put within 28 days of service of report
- Must be to clarify the report.

### Discussion Between Experts (r 35.12)

#### Court Direction

The court will often direct that the parties’ experts should meet and have a without prejudice discussion. Rule 35.12(4) confirms that the content of the discussion between the experts shall not be referred to at the trial unless the parties agree. This should be to agree upon and narrow down the issues (PD 35 para 9.2).

> [!statute] PD 35 para 9.2
> The purpose of discussions between experts is not for experts to settle cases but to agree and narrow issues and in particular to identify:
> - (i) the extent of the agreement between them;
> - (ii) the points of and short reasons for any disagreement;
> - (iii) action, if any, which may be taken to resolve any outstanding points of disagreement; and
> - (iv) any further material issues not raised and the extent to which these issues are agreed.

Parties may agree an agenda of issues for experts to discuss, though these should not be leading/ hostile (PD 35 para 9.3).

#### Written Joint Statement

- Following the discussion, a statement must be prepared by the experts dealing with the points raised.
- Copies signed within 7 days and copies provided to parties within 14 days.
- If an expert opinion is radically changed by the discussion, they should add a note explaining
- r 35.12(5): if the experts agree on something, this does not bind the parties unless the parties agree to be bound.

#### Failure to Comply

Can be consequences similar to an unless order for the party whose expert failed to comply.

#### Changing Experts

If a party's expert changes their mind following discussions with the other expert, they will generally not be entitled to change their expert, unless there is a good reason to do so. Starting point: ask the expert why they changed their mind.

### Single Joint Expert (r 35.7)

In a fast track case, the general approach of the court is to order a single joint expert unless there is good reason not to do so. In a multi-track case, the court may order a joint expert on any quantum issues requiring expert evidence.

See PD 35 para 7 for more details on when permission for a joint expert will be given.

#### Court Direction

When a joint expert is appointed, the court will order:

- Parties prepare joint instructions for the expert
- Expert's fees paid jointly
- If parties fail to decide on an expert by some date, some back to the court for directions.

#### Practical

Parties have a duty to point out errors/ ambiguities in an expert report, to further the overriding objective.

[[Daniels v Walker [2000] 1 WLR 1382]]:

- Where parties cannot organise joint instructions, they can give separate instructions
- Where a party is dissatisfied with a report, they should first ask the expert questions
- After, can apply to court for permission to call another expert.
- If there are multiple experts, the evidence cannot be used until experts meet to resolve their differences.

Parties must speak to a joint expert together: neither party should meet the expert without the other party present.

### Challenging

The usual time to make an application to exclude all/ part of an opponent's expert report is at the trial. If there is some inadmissible evidence in the report, the trial judge will just ignore this. Having to edit the expert's report to delete inadmissible parts seen as contrary to the overriding objective.

## Professional Negligence Cases

In professional negligence claims a defendant is allowed to give their own expert opinion on what they did or did not do that is said to amount to negligence. There is no need for this to be in the format of a Part 35 report. The defendant’s witness statement will suffice.
