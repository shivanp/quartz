# Alternative Dispute Resolution

## Nature of ADR

A means of resolving disputes using an independent third party.

| Type of ADR | Description |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Determinative ADR | Can impose a solution |
| Non-determinative ADR | Cannot impose a solution. |

### Alternatives

Litigation:

- Not voluntary
- Once case starts, neither party can withdraw without paying opponent's costs
- Court imposes a solution if parties cannot come to a settlement.

Arbitration:

- Voluntary in the sense that parties voluntarily entered into an arbitration agreement.
- When a dispute arises, one party can force the other to arbitrate against their will because of the original contractual agreement.
- Arbitrator will impose a solution which the winner can enforce.
- An arbitrator’s award is confidential but binding on the parties.

Strictly speaking, negotiation is a form of ADR. It is both voluntary and non-binding. However, there is no independent third party and the negotiators will normally be identified with their respective sides.

### Independent Third Party

- Independence of the third party is an essential feature.
- Likely to be more accommodating.
- TP trained to be neutral and an industry expert.

## Advantages of ADR

The CPR 1998 specifically recognise the advantages of ADR.

> [!statute] Rule 1.4(2)(e)
> The court may further the overriding objective of dealing with cases justly by encouraging the parties to use an alternative dispute resolution procedure if the court considers that appropriate and facilitating the use of such procedure.

Arbitration and ADR procedures are confidential. Nothing said can be referred to in any later court proceedings unless all parties agree to waive confidentiality.

It can be significantly cheaper than both arbitration and litigation. This is because it is quicker. A skilled neutral can, in most cases that are suitable for ADR, help the parties to resolve their dispute in a relatively short period of time.

### Flexibility

Parties can choose the form of ADR and can choose a procedure to be followed. There is no case law limiting what parties or the neutral can do.

### Preserving Business Relationship

- Virtue of privacy
- Non-confrontational method

### Commercial Reality

Parties may just want realistic and workable terms of settlement.

## Disadvantages of ADR

### Does Not Bind Parties

No one can be forced to resolve a dispute this way. Most agreements allow a party to withdraw at any stage.

The court can stay litigation that has been commenced in breach of an agreed method of

resolving disputes. This is the case even if that method is not technically an arbitration agreement under the Arbitration Act 1996. Indeed, the courts have increasingly stayed proceedings for ADR to take place, whether or not pursuant to a contractual agreement. For example, in [[Cable & Wireless v IBM UK Ltd [2002] BLR 89]], the parties were directed to pursue a previously agreed ADR method.

### Awards Not Easily Enforceable

There is no equivalent of s 66 Arbitration Act 1996 enabling ADR awards to be enforced as if court judgments.

But if parties do agree to terms suggested as a result of non-determinative ADR, they have entered into a contract. A non-compliant party could then be sued for breach of contract, and usually obtain summary judgment (i.e., without a full trial) under Part 24 CPR 1998.

Usually, ADR forms state that no agreement is binding unless in signed writing.

A party who has commenced court proceedings but then resolved the dispute by ADR, can record the agreement reached in a consent order, which can be enforced by the usual methods.

### Facts May Not Be Fully Disclosed

There is no disclosure stage, so less thorough. But in business this can be worth it for efficiency.

### Not Always Appropriate

Such as:

- Where the client needs an injunction or security for costs (requiring a party to pay money into court as security for the costs of the other party, should they lose)
- Where there is no dispute
	- e.g., for a simple debt collection matter, just fill a claim for and a summary judgment application, or consider insolvency proceedings.
- Where the client needs to resolve a point of law.

If the client reasonably believes that they have a watertight case, that might well be sufficient justification for a refusal to mediate (see [[Swain Mason v Mills & Reeve [2012] EWCA Civ 498]]).

A standard direction in proceedings requires a party who rejects a proposal for ADR to file a witness statement detailing their reasons for doing so. This will be available to the trial judge when the issue of costs is considered.

## Types of ADR

### Mediation and Conciliation

(Terms used interchangeably).

- Third party receives written statements from both parties
- Mediator discusses case with parties
- Doesn't need to be face to face

### Med-arb

Parties agree to submit their dispute to mediation and, if this does not work, that they will refer the matter to arbitration.

Possible to use the mediator as arbitrator. This will save costs, though there is a risk their position of being privy to confidential information known to one party will compromise their independent position.

### Mini-trial

Also known as 'structured settlement procedure'. Parties appoint a neutral party who will sit as chair of a tribunal comprised of a chair and senior representatives of each party. The representatives have authority to reach such compromise as they see fit.

### Expert Appraisal

Some or all of the dispute can be referred to an expert in the disputed field for an opinion. The opinion is not binding on the parties, but could influence their approach/ negotiations.

### Judicial Appraisal

The Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) has a scheme whereby former judges and senior counsel are available to give a quick preliminary view on the legal position, having heard representations from both parties. It is a matter for agreement between the parties as to whether this opinion is to be binding on them or not.

### Expert Determination

Halfway house between arbitration and ADR. Parties select an expert to decide the case for them and agree to accept the expert's decision.

If the other party does not accept, it can be sued for breach of contract. But the expert's decision cannot be enforced as a court order, and they do not have the power of an arbitrator under Arbitration Act 1996. Also, unlike an arbitrator, they can be sued in negligence by a party who thinks their decision was wrong.

### Final Offer Arbitration

The parties can instruct their chosen neutral that they will both make an offer of the terms on which they will settle, and that the neutral must choose one of those two offers and no other solution. Neither party can afford to make an unrealistic offer, because that will mean that the neutral will choose the opponent’s offer.

### Early Neutral Evaluation

Allows the parties to instruct their chosen neutral to make a preliminary assessment of the facts at an early stage in the dispute. Normally, the parties

submit written case summaries and supporting documents. The evaluator then makes a recommendation. This very often helps the parties to negotiate a settlement (or move to another ADR method), avoiding the expense of litigation.

> [!statute] Rule 3.1(2)(m) CPR 1998
> The court may take any step or make any order for the purpose of managing the case and furthering the overriding objective, including hearing an early neutral evaluation (ENE) with the aim of helping the parties to settle the case.

> [!question] Can the court order that a judicial appraisal take place by way of ENE against the wishes of the parties?
> Yes, see [[Lomax v Lomax [2019] EWCA Civ 1467]], because it is part of the court process which can assist with the fair and sensible resolution of a case.

The outcome of Judicial ENE is normally 'without prejudice' unless privilege is mutually waived, and is not normally binding unless the parties agree.

### Ombudsman

The number of ombudsman schemes have grown over the years. Some service and goods providers offer similar schemes.

## Organisations Providing ADR

Two groups have pioneered:

- CEDR: independent non-profit promoting ADR
- ADR Group: private company which undertakes mediation and training.

See also Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, Academy of Experts and Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

## Using ADR

Prudent to agree in the original contract that if any dispute arises, it will be resolved by a specified form of ADR.

Existing contracts which provide for arbitration should probably be amended to have some form of mediation as a step.

### Disclosure

Include clauses dealing with potential pitfalls of ADR. Parties should decide whether to have a clause requiring full disclosure. This takes longer and is more expensive, but makes it possible to set aside any ADR settlement reached on discovering that the other party has concealed information.

### Confidentiality

A confidentiality clause encourages full disclosure. Parties will be more likely to disclose information to each other if they know the other party has agreed not to divulge this information to anyone else.

### Other Matters

Specify procedures, appointment of mediator, and that the representatives who attend ADR process must have full authority to settle the dispute there and then.

## Choosing ADR

Discuss the possibility of ADR whenever a dispute arises. If a client is willing to use ADR, use it unless obviously inappropriate.

At the first sign of non-cooperation/ lack of trust, commence arbitration or litigation. You can still continue with ADR too.

Failure to respond to a reasonable proposal to attempt settlement by ADR may have a significant impact on any subsequent order for costs.

## Considerations

| Consideration        | Details                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract             | The contract may specify/ exclude a particular ADR method.                                                     |
| Privacy              | Litigation is very public; "airing dirty laundry"                                                              |
| Publicity            | But client may want to clear their name/ prove that they will take action.                                     |
| Precedent            | Novel point of law? Prevent the possibility of further claims by forming a precedent/ don't want the precedent |
| Jurisdiction         | Issues could be avoided if using mediation and arbitration                                                     |
| Cost/ time           | Litigation is time-consuming and expensive.                                                                    |
| Expert determination | Useful if there is a technical issue                                                                           |
| Relief required      | May require an injunction, which cannot be obtained out of court.                                              |
| Future relationships | Preserving relationship with the opponent; consider using mediation. Can be used to find a middle ground.      |
